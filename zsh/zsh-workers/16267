That should obviously restore the original HISTFILE at the second last
line.

I adapted this into the following, and it's mostly working fine.  However,
every time it saves back to ~/.zcalc_history, it adds two lines from the
old history at the start which I can't seem to get rid of.  Possibly
trimming SAVEHIST to the actual number of lines to save might work.
