Subject: Alignment problem between cursor & prompt - on changing screen size
To: zsh-workers@sunsite.dk
MIME-Version: 1.0

Hello Folks

When I start the ZShell, I get a window & I am able to
use the shell properly

However whenever I resize the shell window, from
default 80x25, & I reach the end of the window, after
the window scrolls, the prompt & the cursor appear on
separate lines .. like this
   >dir
   >
   >
    -

I use Zshell on Windows 2000 Servers ... This problem
only occurs once I change the window size .. Also the
problem disappears if I type "cls"

Has someone faced this problem before ... 

I would really appreciate if someone can help me out
with this problem

Thank you

Nauzad Sadry
