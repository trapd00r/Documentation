The closest I can think of that you can get to this is something like
the following:
  up() { print -r "(../)#$1(Odon[1])" }
  alias up='noglob up'

  less ${~$(up adr*)}

That's not much easier to type but it might make more sense to allow
something like $~(up d*) to work than to add a glob qualifier that
alters the pattern.

In the case of the actual searching upwards problem, I've wondered in
the past whether some actual syntax would make sense. I mostly use it
for getting to Ant build.xml files and have considered using bindkey -s
so that something like '.**/' would expand to '(../)#'. A new syntax
could perhaps work a little differently than '(../)#' to avoid needing
(Odon[1]) or ([-1]). Stopping at the first directory that produces a
match is probably enough (searching up from .. to / not down from / to
..).
