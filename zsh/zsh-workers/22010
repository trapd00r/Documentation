Hi,

This isn't really a major issue, but, sometimes when I start up
an aterm on my NetBSD 2.0 machine (which is my desktop) it
does this...=20

ultraviolet@chutney:~ %> ultraviolet@chutney:~ %>=20

I added the following to my /etc/zshrc file, thats when it started.
And it doesn't happen everytime either, just every sort of 8th time
I start up an aterm.=20

# X11 Terminals.
case $TERM in
        xterm*|rxvt|(K|a)term)  precmd () {
                print -Pn "\033]0;%n@%m%  %~\a"
        }
        preexec () {
                print -Pn "\033]0;%n@%m%  <$1>\a"
        }
        ;;
esac

So there you have it.

Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a=20
system of government. Supreme executive power derives from a mandate=20
from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.
