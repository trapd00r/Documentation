As of Linux kernel release 1.3.0, the machine-dependent signal
macro definitions were moved from /usr/include/linux/signal.h to
/usr/include/asm/signal.h, where asm is actually a link to the
appropriate architecture's subdirectory (named asm-alpha, asm-i386,
asm-m68k and so on). 

If compiled right away, zsh does have funny hangs in strlen() -
I discovered this with a debugger -, because printjobs() in jobs.c
doesn't guard against out-of-bounds access to the sigmsg[] array.

Maybe there is some relation to the signalling problems reported
under HP-UX and other OS. Can someone experiencing these problems
confirm that signames.h was generated properly?

Anyway, the fix for configure.in is included below. I added the
grep test because the file /usr/include/asm/signal.h did exist
under older Linux releases too.

This is for zsh-2.6-beta10.
