Subject: Space-expansion problem in dev-8

I just upgraded from dev-7 to dev-8 to try to fix the following problem,
but it is still there.

If a filename contains spaces (or other escapable characters) and you
expand it via wild-carding, the spaces are not escaped.

For instance:

% zsh -f
% touch 'a b c d e'
% autoload -U compinit
% compinit
% zstyle ':completion:*' completer _expand _complete
% bindkey '\t' complete-word
% ls a*<TAB>

One of the offered suggestions is "a b c d e" rather than "a\ b\ c\ d\ e".
If I complete it without the '*' or expand it without changing tab's key
binding, it works properly.
