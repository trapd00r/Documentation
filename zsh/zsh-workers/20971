How does it differ from current completion?

I actually meant - signal names should be completed only if -k is present=20
(because they are meaningless without). But currently it is possible to=20
implement only using ->state and it seemed too much work for such small=20
function.

Will "prerequisite options" be generally useful? I.e. something like

[-a]-b:....

with semantic "-b is offered only if -a is already present". I suspect this=
=20
may have simplified a number of functions.
