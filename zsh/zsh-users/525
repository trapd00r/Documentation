	Hello all,

	Does anyone know why I would be getting the above error messages 
from zsh. 

	It seems to be caused by defining the STTY envariable, and executing a 
sequence of commands hooked together via shell pipes from my .zshrc 
file.  For each pipe, I get one of the above stty error messages.  If I 
unset the STTY envariable, the problem goes away  (I even get the error 
messages if the envariable is set to the empty string!)

	Why ?  What does setting this envariable have to do with operation on 
a socket.  Isn't this envariable ignored unless the shell (i.e. 
command) being run is an interactive shell ?

	I'm running this on a SunOS 4.1.3 box, but I've also seen it on a 
Solaris 2.5 machine.  This is with Zsh 3.0.0.

	Thanks for any clues,
	greg
