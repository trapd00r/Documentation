} Irritating, isn't it? ;-)

Those characters are just stipple-patterns in a VGA console font; the
faded/shaded themes actually look best on the raw console of an x86-PC
unix system such as Linux (i.e. without X11).

It ought to be possible to use actual colors for the fade from one color
to another, but to do so for an arbitrary pair of colors would require
a ridiculously big lookup table to find the correct ANSI codes.  Maybe
there's some algorithmic way involving an AA that keys the ANSI codes
on their RGB values ...
