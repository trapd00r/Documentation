} 
} I can't speak to the original Bourne shell, but a strictly POSIX shell 
} still has "export ENV=~/.shrc" as an option, which would seem preferable.

I may be mistaken, but doesn't ENV work the way ~/.zshenv does, that is,
it is read by *every* shell, interactive or not?

That's still not equivalent to ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc.
