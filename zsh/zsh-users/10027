Hi,

I was about to test zsh-4.3.2 to see how UTF-8 support is working but I
noticed the following lines in my ~/.zshrc. Any ideas are they ok when
trying to use UTF-8?

# Enable ISO-8859-1 support
setopt PRINT_EIGHT_BIT
stty cs8

If there are not causing any harm I'll surely leave them as is but if
you know any reason to change or disable them with UTF-8 please let me
know.

Thanks.
