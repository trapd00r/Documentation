[resending as my post from Monday seems not to have made it to the list]

% unset Q
% ls $Q/ <tab>

lists completions in '/' rather than beep because there are no
completions.

I do have the 'nounset' option set, though I think this should
give an error / no completions either way, as it did with the
old compctl system.
