I've been on an old version of zsh (beta7) for a long time, I don't
know when this bug came up.  Here's what I'm seeing:

  j:1% ls
  bug.1  ok
  j:1% print -l 'setopt extended_glob' 'print -c [a-z]#' | zsh-2.6-beta7 -f
  ok
  j:1% print -l 'setopt extended_glob' 'print -c [a-z]#' | zsh-2.6-beta18 -f
  bug.1  ok
  j:1% _

I ended up with this while trying to track down another globbing
strangeness (I get no matches from

    autoload $_dir/[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_---.]#(-.:t)

), I don't know if it's somehow the same bug or not.
