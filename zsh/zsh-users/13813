Huh, neat.  I didn't realize (until tangentially looking it up on 
Wikipedia[1]) that NTFS accommodates POSIX filenames (only the null 
character and '/' are always forbidden in NTFS filenames.)  In "Win32" 
mode, it still excludes '\' (the path separator) plus the forbidden seven: 
/:*?"<>


An article from the MSDN Library[2] (which is an interesting read if you 
have to deal with Windows) seems to corroborate your "If they don't then 
they are actually broken":

"""
File I/O functions in the Windows API convert "/" to "\" as part of 
converting the name to an NT-style name, except when using the "\\?\" 
prefix as detailed in the following sections.
"""

Which, I suppose, makes "cmd" broken.  (In more ways than it already 
seemed.)  As a quick test, out of 'dir', 'copy', 'move', 'type', and 'cd', 
only 'cd' accepts forward slashes[3].  Windows PowerShell handles them 
all.

Thanks for the history (especially after following some of the 
hyperlinks).

Best,
