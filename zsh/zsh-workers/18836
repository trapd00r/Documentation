Subject: PATCH: read -d $'\0' doesn't work
Date: Wed, 09 Jul 2003 11:59:11 +0100
Message-ID: <16202.1057748351@csr.com>

I tried:

  find ... -print0 | while read -d $'\0' ...

and found that NULL delimiters don't work.  Since this is the most
obvious use of -d, I imagine no-one uses this feature much.  The read
builtin doesn't handle metafied delimiters correctly.

I'll apply this to 4.0, too.

Possibly also 18769 (autoload error) if the dust has settled?  I'm
pretty convinced it's the lesser of two evils.
