I got the shell to crash when completing (actually an attempted
expansion) after "echo ~[]".  Apart from the suggestive command line,
this is actually unrelated to dynamic named directories.  The expansion
not surprising doesn't succeed anyway, so I haven't worried too much
(or at all) about what the shell code is doing that provokes this; it
appears to be an invalid pattern in a search through an associative
array, which is indeed not properly handled at this point.
