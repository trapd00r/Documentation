I'm not going to change the existing behaviour in native mode.  I might
conceivably change it when some additional option were set to put into
it some compatibility mode.  Currently no one has asked even for that.

zsh runs the last part of the pipeline in the current shell if it
consists only of shell commands, which is different from some other
shells.  This difference is allowed by the standard, although whether
knock-on differences, like the one you mention, are also allowed is a
different question.  Anyway, the native shell behaviour won't change.
