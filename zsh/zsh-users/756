Currently the way to do this is:

bindkey -s "^P" "^qpwd\n"

in which the ^q saves the line on the buffer stack, which is restored
after "pwd\n" is executed as input (this assumes emacs bindings; it's
actually a little better to have push-input bound to something and use
that instead of the ^q).

Maybe other ways will be forthcoming.
