Because it is the default.  The manual says:

          -e    Without -d this option has no effect.   Otherwise
               this can be combined with -F, -B, -w, -a, -R and -
               G to get names of  functions,  builtins,  reserved
               words or aliases even if they are disabled.

It may be changed to -e combined with -F, -B ... lists enabled ... but
that's the default unless -d is also given.  So in fact it has no effect
without -d.
