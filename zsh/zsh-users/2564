I use brace expansion with for constructs most or the time :

for i in {foo,bar,hux}; do touch $i; done

And I don't like setopt cshnullglob because it gives strange behaviour
when I use a single globbing pattern which fails. Like :

grep foo*bar | less

If foo*bar matches nothing, it's exactly like : grep | less
which stops, waiting for input.

It a matter of taste, and that's why options a for.
