Excuse me???  I'm sorry, I'm not a flamer, but you are really really
asking for it.  Perhaps you've never tried to maintain the configure
script for a package.

There are standards for this stuff.  Look at:
http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/7908799/xsh/dup.html

       #include <unistd.h>

       int dup(int fildes);
       int dup2(int fildes, int fildes2);

This is not about legal issues, or about freedom. (or free beer, for
that matter)

Have you ever heard of `configure'?  Have you considered that some
software might try to examine its environment, and deduce some things
from that examination?  Maybe it will check if there is a libc.h
installed, and will

#include <libc.h>

if so?

MS> I'd consider this a sa non-bug.

Please please please please reconsider.

If you don't consider this a bug, I will recommend that all my friends 
uninstall Debian and install Red Hat or Suse instead.  I'm a long time 
Red Hat user, and although it has not been without problems, I never
once experienced anything this stupid.

Martin
