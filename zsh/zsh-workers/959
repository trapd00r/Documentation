Hi all,
can anybody give me a hint for doing the following in zsh - probably it's easy.

Sometimes I do a very critical command using e.g.  ~-  or  ~WORK  like
rm -rf ~-

Before executing this command I would like to see the expansion of it
(show me, what ~- really is)

Is this possible with a keystroke?

Thanks for any hints,
Helmut Jarausch.
