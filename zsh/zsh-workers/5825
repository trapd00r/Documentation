What about Functions, Misc (and StartupFiles, for that matter)?

Specifically, what does RedHat do when they build a binary package of
zsh?  (I really ought to look, I suppose!)  

I'm guessing they regard the example functions and things as
documentation, and install it into /usr/doc/zsh-$ZSH_VERSION.

Why not install the whole lot in subdirectories of
$prefix/lib/zsh/3.1.6?  Actually, I suppose that looks ugly, since the
modules get stuck there.  Maybe the modules could go into a
subdirectory too?  

I suppose the scripts really ought to go into
$prefix/share/zsh/$ZSH_VERSION/*.  That would be a better division.
So the modules stay where they are, and the scripts (including
completion) get stuck in share somewhere.

I'd prefer to have them installed automatically.  I don't see the need
for optional installation of these scripts.

OK.

OK.  As far as I remember, the last time I read the manual I didn't
notice anything wrong (other than features I hadn't noticed before,
and the general overwhelming complexity of it).  

So I probably shouldn't spend time on checking the documentation.  If
I feel the urge, I may have a go at writing some new documentation
instead.
