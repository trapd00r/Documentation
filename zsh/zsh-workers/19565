Probably better to rephrase the parenthesis so that it says something
like

  For associative arrays, `tt([*])' or `tt([@])' evaluate to all the
  values, in no particular order.  Note this does not substitute
  the keys; see the documentation for the `tt(k)' flag under
  ifzman(em(Parameter Expansion Flags) in zmanref(zshexpn))\
  ifnzman(noderef(Parameter Expansion))
  for complete details.

but otherwise looks OK.  Thanks.
