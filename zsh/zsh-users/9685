Subject: Mysterious completion of variables
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable
Content-Disposition: inline

I have a few variables for hosts that I shell into frequently:

  aspen=3D'me@aspen.mydomain.com'
  alias aspen=3D"ssh $aspen"

Thus, I'm usually able to do the following:

  scp $aspen:temp .

This usually works, but there are occasions where I get strange
completion after I hit <Enter>:

  cp: cannot stat `me@aspen.mydomain.comemp': No such file or directory

Sounds like it's interpolating ':t', but I'm not sure why. Ideas?
