} Hm.  The string in %{..%} is affected to truncation.  It is wrong.

Maybe, but (I think) so is your usage of %<..<, since zsh-workers/4601.
I believe you want something like

PS1=$'[%20<..<%/%<<]%{\e[33m%}'

There does seem to be a bug with handling of turncations inside the %()
conditional construct; if the truncation is in the "true" branch, then
the false branch and the trailing `)' are left as part of the prompt.
