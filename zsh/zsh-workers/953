Once upon a time... when I was fiddling with the execution code I used
this field. It was used for stopping pipelines with loops (and other
shell-internal things) at the end. For doing that the current shell
forked and used the child to represent the end of the pipe. The other
field of the job representing the stopped child held the job number of
the `old' job (the one representing the head of the pipe), so that
both of them could be made runnable.

Since there have been lots of changes in the execution and signal code
I no longer know if it is still needed (maybe the fact that it isn't
used anymore is connected to the fact that several bugs -- like the
infamous never-^C-less-bug -- have reappeared).

Bye
 Sven
