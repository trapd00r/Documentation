Subject: start zsh while skipping all files
Date: Thu, 23 Nov 2006 19:19:56 -0800
To: zsh-users@sunsite.dk
X-Mailer: Apple Mail (2.752.3)

Is there a way to start zsh and force it to skip everything,  
including /etc/zshenv ?

I RTFM and it looks like there is not

(eg:  "/etc/zshenv   --  Always run for every zsh." )

but I thought I should ask before giving up.

Thanks.

Bill
