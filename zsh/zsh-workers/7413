Subject: Minor .cvsignore problem
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

The Src/.cvsignore file includes the pattern *.pro to eliminate the files
containing automatically-generated function prototypes.  A minor problem
is that this causes cvs to ignore the file .indent.pro as well.

A possible fix is to change the pattern in .cvsignore to [a-z]*.pro, or to
[A-Za-z]*.pro, or ... what would be best?
