} So what your code improves?

It offers both signals and process names when completing after "killall"
with nothing else on the line yet.

} May be the solution is to generate -SIGNALS as options?

You could try it, but I think there might be a problem because, for
example, -ABRT can be (mis)interpreted as -A -B -R -T.  This is a case
where the command's syntax conflicts with the standard option/argument
syntax that _arguments is designed to support.
