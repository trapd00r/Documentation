Subject: Extraneous CVS branch tags?
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Working file: Src/params.c
symbolic names:
        zsh-4_0-patches: 1.48.0.4
        zsh-4_0_1-patches: 1.48.0.2

I suspect we should delete the zsh-4_0_1-patches tag?  It's only going to
confuse people (like, me).

Unfortunately, I don't recall all the ramifications of deleting branch tags.
I think it should be harmless as long as there's no activity on that branch
(which should be the case here, I hope).
