You can do this (works OK on Cygwin):

  zmodload -i zsh/zselect
  zselect -t 10

The time is in 100ths of a second, because I didn't use floating point
numbers (I would have if I was doing it now).  Also, the status returned
is 1 whether or not it was interrupted (because it's really a timeout),
so this is a little inconvenient.

We could do with a builtin, which would be fairly easy.
