I've added you to the list, but for now there seems to be some problem
with sourceforge (maybe related to the error handler bug Bart spotted
earlier, which does in fact affect me too) preventing me from updating
developer permissions, so if you don't have enough permissions there's
not much I (we?) can do right now.  I've submitted reports of these
bugs to sourceforge's own bug tracker so hopefully they'll be resolved
soon.  Noone's awake on the #sourceforge IRC channel unfortunately.
