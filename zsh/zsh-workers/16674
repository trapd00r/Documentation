Thanks Sven.  A single colon works for me.  I previously posted a patch that
fixed the problem in _cvs by reordering the arguments, so _cvs no longer has
the bug I hit.  I have some pending patches for _cvs that I want to submit
at some point.  Maybe I'll add in colons for _cvs, also.  But it might be a
while before I have time...

-FR.
