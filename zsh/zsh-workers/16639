Subject: false prefix-needed in _arguments

The prefix-needed style in _arguments doesn't seem to be working:

_f() { _arguments '-a' '-b' '1:files:_files' }
zstyle '*' prefix-needed false
compdef _f f
f <tab>

And only files are offered. It should be offering both files and
options.

I've always had prefix-needed set to true so only noticed this when I
tried setting:
  zstyle ':completion:*:option-*:options' prefix-needed false
so that options are listed when the argument to an option is optional.
