} Don't you mean $~* there?  Otherwise you have the problem with
} multiple directories that you alluded to once before.

I later realized that I was misled by the

    [[ $# -eq 0 ]] && set '*'

into thinking you were still working with the noglob alias around
the function.  If the glob is already expanded before the function
call, please ignore what I said about $~*.

In either case, though, the reply=() line is unnecessary.
