I haven't heard this one before, and without access to the system
there's not a lot that can be done.  You could try statically linking
(configure --disable-dynamic), in which case make sure you edit
config.modules to mark any modules you use as statically loaded.

If it's only a few of the symbols from the main executable it might be
they aren't correctly marked for export, however I thought I'd tested
that for 4.3.4 and there shouldn't be more than a few at most in any
case.  I will certainly make sure I test this for 4.3.5.
