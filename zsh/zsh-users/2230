	i think the idea is that the same sorts of commands will go in the
equivalent system-wide and user-specific files, so that by sourcing the
user files right after the relevant system files, the user can always override
the system options.  in other words, if your sysadmin is setting PATH and umask 
in /etc/zshrc, try setting it to your value in your own .zshrc instead of your 
.zprofile.
