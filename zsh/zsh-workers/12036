Oh, so the documentation under "Autoloaded Functions" is wrong?

Thanks.

} Or should we give that as a choice at the prompt (don't use/use/ignore)?

It wouldn't hurt, but it's not as important.  However, I think you have
the prompt wrong ... isn't the default answer usually the first one?  You
have "... continue [yn]?" but if I just hit return that's taken as n, not
y, so it should be "... continue [ny]?".  I was about to append a patch,
but then I became indecisive as to the default *should* be, particularly
if we allow three choices.
