greetings,

i have downloaded and compiled the latest version of
zsh (2.5.03) on several machines. it is running fine
on four sgis ( with irix versions from 4 to 5 ).
unfortunately, i had serious problems running it on
a titan running 'TitanOS UNIX Release 4.2 P2 on 3000 Series'.
it compiled fine with bunch of warnings ( as i was warned of ).
the problem is that filename generation is acting very strangely.
problems:
1) when i first run zsh ( starting from a csh ), it changes
to the root directory.
2) when i try 'ls -d a*' in a directory which contains
the following files:
 ammar  run.1  run.2  temp
i get these messages:
amma: No such file or directory
amtables: No such file or directory
authority: No such file or directory

[ amtables -> .gamtables
  amma     -> .gamma
  authorithy -> .Xauthority, hidden files ]

can you please help me solve this problem ?

maybe a copy of the output from 'buildzsh auto' can be
useful:

#
# buildzsh -- zsh configuration tool
#
# try "buildzsh help" for more information

You may want to look at the file(s) I just created:

	config.h
	signals.h
	Makefile

to make sure they are correct.	Or you may just want
to go ahead and try running make to see what happens.

Shall I execute "make" now? 
In that case you will have to call the following yourself:

	make



n.b.: i am not subscrided.

sincerely,
Berk Geveci
