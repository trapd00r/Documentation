Oh, look Bart, there's the reason to not always use shout (11036).

The patch tries to make sure we're always on the save side. I
hope. It's different from the pre-11036 state.

But with zle not loaded, the

	zsh -c "read -q '?Can you see this? '" < /dev/null >& /dev/null

from 11036 doesn't show the prompt (but at least it doesn't segv
anymore). Is it right or wrong? Do we have to work around it?

Bye
 Sven
