Paul,

configure is not a static thing the same on every system it varies from
package to package.  look at it and find the area thats doing the test that
kills mac.  usually config has created an executable that has insufficient
stack space when this happens. you can change the script to change the
stack size to something larger before it runs i belive.  or you can use the
gcc command line arguments in the compile (the one commanded by config
script) to set the stack at compile time.  in rare cases the actuall gcc
cc1 has to small a stack to compile twhat config tells it to.  in this case
up the stack size on cc1.

just a guess.

At a recent computer software engineering course in the US, the participants
were given an awkward question to answer.  "If you had just boarded an
airliner and discovered that your team of programmers had been responsible
for the flight control software, how many of you would disembark
immediately?"
