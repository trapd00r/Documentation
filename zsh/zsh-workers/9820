I hope you really mean `indexes' and -- in a separate word --
`parameters'. Otherwise this would mean they should both be tried
immediatly and together...

> It seems that when _subscript is run, $curcontext is ':complete:-subscript-'. Why is 'completion' not in there as the first bit. As far as I can tell, 'complete' is put there by the complete completer.

Because its given in the calls to zstyle.

Always remember that now the context names simply and cleanly always
have the fixed format: `:completion:<function>:<completer>:<command>:<arg>:<tag>'.
Where <command> may also be one of the special contexts. So, what you
want is:

  zstyle ':completion:*:*:-subscript-:*' tag-order indexes parameters


Bye
 Sven

P.S.: But just being able to define such things is fun, isn't it?
