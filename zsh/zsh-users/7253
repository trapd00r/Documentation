> This is great, but can anyone explain what's going on?

Unfortunately using matcher styles makes the already hard-to-understand
_path_files even more difficult.

You could try running ^x? (_complete_debug) in place of completion.
That will at least show you what it's executing.  Unfortunately the
output is likely to be the size of the telephone directory.

Have you tried setting the new option nocaseglob?
