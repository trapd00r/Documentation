The version of the new completion functions is the one Sven posted as the
tar file with Functions/NewComp in it.

The changes included are the following.  Some of the changes in the
completion are made irrelevant by later ones, but it includes everything I
applied.

Oliver Kiddle: another change of mailing list host, 5372

Oliver: compctl -T documentation for ~dirs, 5374

Andrej: Reliant UNIX configuration, 5377

Sven: Manual for new completion (so far), 5384, 5397

Me: dump new completion status for fast initialisation, 5393

Me: bug fixlet for __path_files, 5398

Sven: overhaul of do_ambiguous with some bug-fixage, 5399, 5407

Sven: print needs - in Functions/Completion/dump, 5400; auto-dump and use
$COMPDUMP file, 5402

Sven: files -> __files, 5401

Me: magicequalsubst now affects all arguments ...=~...:~..., 5403

Me: set -x output for [[ ... ]], 5408

Me: IRIX 6.5 problems in Etc/MACHINES (see 5410 from Helmut Jarausch).

Sven: 5412: better matcher control.

Sven: 5415: anchors in matchers shouldn't match variable part of completion

Sven: 5417: multiple subscripts with undefined array

Sven: 5418: small addmatches fixes

Me: 5421: setting same element of assoc array in full array assignment crashed

Sven: 5422: braces in completions were not tokenized; array parameters were
used uncopied

Sven: 5423: compadd accepts either - or -- to end options

Sven: 5424: addmatches fix when not doing matching

Me: 5425: fix pattern matching for new completion

Sven: 5429: $CONTEXT strings

Sven: 5430: rewrite Functions/Completions with simplified syntax (no #array
type completions).

Me: 5436: set -x for function calls and ((...)).

Me: unposted (but see 5440): zftp changes: more return 6's, functions now
do auto-open and avoid subshells.
