                                    Glossary

   Action fields
          Features in set-up that make the VT320 perform an immediate
          action.

   Application software
          A program that performs a specific function for a particular
          class of computer users. Examples: spreadsheets and word
          processing programs.

   ASCII
          American Standard Code for Information Interchange

   ANSI
          American National Standards Institute

   Auto print mode
          A method of printing information directly from the host system.
          The VT320 sends a display line to the printer after a carriage
          return or form feed character.

   CCITT
          Comite Consultatif International de Telegraphique et
          Telephonique (International Telegraph and Telephone Consultative
          Committee). A standards committee for the communication industry
          in Europe.

   Character set
          A group of graphic characters and control characters stored as a
          unit in the terminal. Graphic characters are characters you can
          display on the screen. Control characters perform special
          functions.

   Compose character
          A character produced when you press two or three keys in a
          certain sequence. You can use compose sequences to produce
          characters that do not appear as standard keys on your keyboard.

   Cursor
          An indicator that highlights the active position on the screen.
          The VT320 uses different cursor characters for (1) text, (2)
          set-up, and (3) the CRT saver feature.

   Data processing keys
          Keys that have three or four characters on the top of their
          keycap. The characters on the right half of the keycap are data
          processing characters. To use data processing characters, you
          must set the ______ Keys feature in the Keyboard Set-Up screen
          to "Data Processing Keys".

   Diacritical marks
          Marks or symbols that indicate a change in the standard
          pronunciation of a letter. Examples of diacritics are the acute
          accent (´), grave accent (`), and tilde (~).

          On the VT420, you can use diacritical marks (if available on
          your keyboard) to start two-stroke compose sequences. When you
          press a key with a nonspacing diacritical mark, the cursor does
          not advance until you press the next key.

   Display
          The information that appears on the screen.

   Factory default
          A standard setting for a feature. The VT420 uses factory-default
          settings, unless you select a new setting. Many set-up features
          have default settings.

   Full-duplex modem
          A modem that can handle simultaneous, two-way communications.

   Host system
          The computer system(s) you connect to the VT420. If you connect
          the terminal to two systems, one is the primary host and one is
          the secondary host.

   Inactive session
          A session that you are not currently using. You can run two
          sessions at the same time on the VT420, but you can only
          interact with one session at a time.

   Keyboard indicator line
          A status line with six fields that provide information about the
          keyboard's status. The keyboard indicator line appears at the
          bottom of the screen, in the smaller, 132-column font. See also
          status line.

   Modem
          Modulator - demodulator. A device that converts data from a
          computer or terminal into signals that can be sent over a
          telephone line.

   Modifier key
          A key pressed in combination with another key, to modify the
          code sent by that key. Ctrl is a modifier key.

   National replacement character set
          Seven-bit character sets for many European languages. Each
          character set with 94 characters. NRC sets are similar to the
          ASCII set, except for a few characters.

   Nonspacing diacritical keys
          See Diacritical marks.

   Nonvolatile memory
          Nonvolatile RAM (random access memory). The VT420 uses this
          memory to store the saved settings of set-up features. The
          settings are not lost when you turn the terminal off.

   Page
          A section of the terminal's page memory. Each page has left,
          right, top and bottom margins. You can define the size and
          layout of a page by using the page arrangement feature.

   Page arrangement
          A set-up feature that divides page memory into one of four
          standard page sizes. The default setting of the page arrangement
          feature is 3 pages of 24 lines each (for two sessions) or 6
          pages of 24 lines each (for a single session).

   Page memory
          Memory in the VT420 that can store the information you enter
          from the keyboard. The total size of page memory is 144 lines.
          Page memory is divided into pages. You can select from several
          standard page sizes. The amount of memory available depends on
          the page size selected and the number of sessions used (one or
          two).

   Panning
          Pointing a window to display different parts of page memory.
          Panning a window is similar to panning a camera. The window does
          not move on the screen; you point the window at another location
          in page memory.

   Pixel
          Picture elements. The smallest displayable unit on a video
          screen. To display a character, the terminal turns on a series
          of pixels.

   Port
          The logical route for data in or out of the controller board on
          the VT420. Also, another term for connector. One port can
          support one or more connectors. All the VT420 connectors are on
          the rear of the terminal.

   Prefix key
          A key that you press and release before pressing another key, to
          change the function of one or more keystrokes. Compose Character
          is a prefix key.

   Resynchronize
          To restore communication with an interrupted session.

   Saved settings
          The settings of set-up features that the VT420 uses when you
          turn the terminal on. You can change these settings or use the
          factory-default settings.

   Scrolling
          Moving data between the margins of the page currently displayed.
          Data scrolled past the margins is lost from page memory, but
          usually not from the host system.

   Scrolling region
          The area on the current page that is between the top, bottom,
          left, and right page margins. The default scrolling region is
          the complete page. Only a programmer can change the page
          margins.

   Session
          An active connection between the VT420 and a host system. When
          you log in to a computer from the terminal, you open a session.

   Set-up
          A set of display screens on the VT420 that let you examine and
          change the settings of the terminal's operating features. You
          can use the keyboard to change settings.

   SSU
          Digital's Session Support Utility. This software lets you run
          two sessions over one communication line.

   Status line
          A display line that provides information about the session's
          current operating state. The status line appears at the bottom
          of the screen or at the bottom of the session (if you are
          running two sessions). The VT420's status display feature has
          three settings -- indicator, none, and host-writable. The VT420
          always displays the status line for the current session in
          set-up.

   Terminal server
          An intelligent unit that can connect a number of asynchronous
          devices (terminals and printers) to a host system. For example,
          Digital's DECserver 200 can link eight VT420 terminals to a
          system in a local area network (LAN), using a high-speed
          Ethernet cable.

   User-defined keys (UDKs)
          Any of the 15 keys, F6 to F20, on the top row of the keyboard
          for which a user has defined special functions. You can use UDKs
          to store frequently used text and commands.

   Visual character attribute
          A quality of a display character that highlights the character,
          such as bolding and underlining.

   Window
          A specified area of the screen used to display information from
          page memory. You can divide the screen horizontally into two
          windows, to display information from two sessions at the same
          time.
