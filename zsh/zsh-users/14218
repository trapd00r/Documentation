So I started to write this, then grep'd my config to look for an example
and saw that I'd already written it once before, in the same way, just
with a differently named function for the widget and bound differently.

----------------------------8< cut here >8------------------------------
function backward-kill-partial-word {
        local WORDCHARS="${WORDCHARS//[\/.]/}"
        zle backward-kill-word "$@"
}
zle -N backward-kill-partial-word
bindkey '^Xw' backward-kill-partial-word
----------------------------8< cut here >8------------------------------

I think that I'll bind that to ESC-Backspace too, that way I might
remember that I have it.  :-/  Sheesh, I only wrote it four months ago
and forgotten already.

Regards,
