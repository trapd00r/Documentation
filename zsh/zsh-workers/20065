This is how tcsh works with 'dextract' set:

% dirs
/tmp/a /tmp/b /tmp/c /tmp/d /tmp/e 
% pushd +2
0       /tmp/c
1       /tmp/a
2       /tmp/b
3       /tmp/d
4       /tmp/e

That is also how I believe zsh is documented to work (and how I would like it to work).

But here is what zsh does:

202 Z% echo $ZSH_VERSION
4.2.0
Z% dirs
/tmp/a /tmp/b /tmp/c /tmp/d /tmp/e
Z% pushd +2
/tmp/c /tmp/d /tmp/e /tmp/a /tmp/b
Z%
