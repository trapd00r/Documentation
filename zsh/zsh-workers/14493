Subject: termcap bug on Linux
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii; format=flowed
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Mandrake cooker (currently glibc-2.2.3, termcap-11.0.1-4mdk) compiled 
with termcap, no ncurses.tgetflag() returns 0 for both unset and 
nonexsiting flags, which means that $termcap[cap] returns "no" for 
almost everything except numeric capabilities. As example:

bor@localhost% print $termcap[ae]
no

even when `ae' is string capability and is defined.

The only possible solution seems to check for string first; at least 
then existing string caps will be returned correctly.
