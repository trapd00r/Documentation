Subject: another file completion problem in 4.3.9-dev-2
Reply-To: gak@klanderman.net
X-Mailer: VM 7.17 under 21.4 (patch 17) "Jumbo Shrimp" XEmacs Lucid
X-Virus-Scanned: ClamAV 0.92.1/9313/Sat May  2 00:13:48 2009 on bifrost
X-Virus-Status: Clean


Here's another file completion problem in 4.3.9-dev-2:

| [~] greg@lwm| zsh -f     
| lwm% echo $ZSH_VERSION
| 4.3.9-dev-2
| lwm% echo $ZSH_PATCHLEVEL
| 1.4662
| lwm% rm .zcompdump
| lwm% autoload -U compinit
| lwm% compinit -u
| lwm% zstyle ':completion:*' matcher-list '' 'm:{a-zA-Z}={A-Za-z}' '+ l:|=* r:|=*'
| lwm% mkdir temp
| lwm% cd temp
| lwm% touch BarBaz

Now if I try to complete "ls baz", I get nothing.

But if I complete "ls az", it does correctly complete to "ls BarBaz".

thanks,
Greg
