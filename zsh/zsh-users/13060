Subject: History expansion to rerun multiple contiguous commands?

Is there a way to use bang notation to re-run a chunk of a shell's 
history?  As an example I've got 4 commands numbered 123-126 in my 
history and I want to (in one swell foop) rerun all 4.

I know worst case I can manually type out "!123 ; !124 ; !125 ; !126" 
but that seems . . . inelegant.

I tried a couple of quick tricks building that expansion by hand and 
then passing it to eval but that doesn't want to seem to do the 
necessary history expansion.


Thanks in advance.
