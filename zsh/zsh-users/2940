It simply sets wrong permissions :-)
(and not every chmod has -R, which is bad)

[from "man chmod"]:
       The letters `rwxXstugo' select the new permissions for the
       affected users: [...] execute only if the file is a directory
       or already has execute permission for some user  (X)
Oops - there's already some plain file mode 755 which I want to have
mode 644 - your solution won't work...

I don't like M-h :-)
(well, and I use ^X <something else> for further mappings, so it is
simply consistent)

CU,
