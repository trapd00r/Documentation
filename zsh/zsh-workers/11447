Subject: _telnet niggle

It's a small but non-zero niggle that _telnet doesn't use hosts-ports, just
users-hosts-ports.  The most common usage for telnet in my experience is
not to specify the host on the command line, even if you give the port.
Consequently it probably ought to use hosts-ports if there is no
user (luckily that's the first thing it gets if there is one).  There may
be other combinations with similar niggles; it's a thankless task tracking
this sort of thing down.
