Hello,

I have just tried to build unicode-enabled zsh (recent cvs snapshot,
by simply adding -DZLE_UNICODE_SUPPORT=1 to CFLAGS), and I get the
following problem (zsh running under gdb running under GNU screen):

[test@solemn test]$ LC_ALL=C gdb zsh
...
(gdb) r
Starting program: /bin/zsh
test@solemn ~ $ echo $ZSH_V<TAB><TAB>

(gdb)

So... what is the status of Unicode support?
Is it supposed to work with plain POSIX locale?
