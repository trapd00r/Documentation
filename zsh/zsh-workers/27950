That's a bit bizarre: two extra spaces have appeared at the end of this and
other lines.  I thinks that's happened because I patched it from email and
committed it from there rather than from where I wrote it.  It
still shouldn't have happened.  I'll remove the spaces (it's not a very
interesting patch).
