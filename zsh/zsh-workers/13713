Subject: Correction of files after ~/
Date: Thu, 22 Mar 2001 17:41:52 +0000
From: Peter Stephenson <pws@csr.com>

Correction/approximation of filenames which begin with a `~' appears to be
broken.  I think this has happened before.  I'm not aware of any styles I
have that would affect this (note careful phrasing).

Could somebody who understands this put some tests with leading ~'s into
the completion part of the test suite?
