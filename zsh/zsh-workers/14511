} Hmm.  Are there other platforms that don't HAVE_PATH_FD where process
} substitution does work?

That reminds me:  Can anyone think of a portable test for whether the
current directory is on an NFS filesystem?  The best I could come up
with is `df . | grep :/' but I don't think `df' works appropriately on
all platforms.  `mkfifo' and friends fail on older versions of NFS but
seem to work on linux, and anyway that'd be hard to distinguish from
an OS where `mknod ... p' or `mkfifo' never work.  I'm prety sure that
only GNU can `find . -fstype nfs -prune'.  What else?
