No, the new copyright doesn't bother me.  I would agree to using it on
the parts I have copyrighted.  But I still don't know if that allows us
to add code that is under the GPL.  I thought that would require the
rest of the code to be under GPL (which I'm generally against).  I like
the fact that the source code of zsh is available.  But if someone
wants to distribute zsh binaries without source code, that is fine with
me.  I hate forcing someone to distribute source code by using the GPL.

Of course, this is just my opinion.
