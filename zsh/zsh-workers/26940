So presumably the underlying problem is the same as the failure in the
test that needs investigating.

Taking out the LC_ALL should produce some sensible output if you omit
the read.  (Replacing it with xxd or failing that od -x might make it
clearer what's going on.)

If you're simply taking out the subshell and not replacing it with
anything then the LC_ALL=C covers the "read" as well as the "print".
So possibly something strange is happening in the read.  Replacing it
with xxd might be even more instructive here.
