} I have wondered what the COMPLETE_IN_WORD option actually does for
} years.
} 
} But it never works when I try it:

That's probably because you have TAB bound to expand-or-complete-prefix.
The examples assume you have it bound to either expand-or-complete or
simply complete-word.

Using expand-or-complete-prefix explicitly neutralizes COMPLETE_IN_WORD,
because it forces completion to ignore everything after the cursor.

Only setopts are reset by "emulate -R", not keybindings or variables.
