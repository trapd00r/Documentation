Subject: Bug#336547: zsh: zcalc does not use $ZDOTDIR when defined, as the base dir for history file

Misc/zcalc uses a file .zcalc_history for storing a persistent
expression history. It would be more consistent if it uses $ZDOTDIR
when defined, instead of ~, as the directory for this history file.
