Damn. All of these work for me. Putting `set -x' at the top of
`_path_files' and giving me the output would be helpful (probably need 
not be sent to the list).

And, yes, the patches were for the clean, unpatched pws-13 I got this

Question to others: do you see the same behavior Andrej does? I.e. is
it me or is it the rest of the world who has run out of sync?
