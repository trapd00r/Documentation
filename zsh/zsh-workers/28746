} Why are these things called 'anonymous functions'?  That name connotes
} lambda, which would create an unnamed function you could store in a
} variable

Unfortunately it really only means an unnamed function for scoping, so
you can use "local" and "return" to save/restore variables and set the
status.  It does not connote a closure (is not like a lambda expression).

This is partly for simplicity of the implementation, but partly because
the shell language doesn't really provide a syntax for returning values
from functions or commands (except in the limited context of $(( ... ))
math expressions) -- hence all the hacks with $REPLY.
