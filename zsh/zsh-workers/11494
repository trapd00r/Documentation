Nonsense. What should that mean? `Start selection when the matches
don't fit on the screen, oh, *and* start selection always'??

You were asking for a way to start selection in listing-widgets when
the list doesn't fit on the screen. That's what `select=long-list' is
for, as explained in the docs.

Bye
