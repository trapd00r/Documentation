This patch clashes with an attempt to parse the output of ant to do
something or other, and will need to be resolved with what's now in the
CVS archive, unfortunately.  I'm afraid I can't help since I don't know
enough about ant to see if it's the same thing you're trying, nor to fix
up the clash if it's something different.
