I replied to this on Sunday but it looks like it didn't get to the
list, so I'm assuming it didn't get anywhere.

The problem was that the pattern matcher didn't know that the `|' was
the end of the pattern, because the alternative after it was
completely separate.  The reason is that `|'s are usually buried
inside parentheses, so aren't the end of a pattern.  That was so in
the old `case' code, which just stuck an open parenthesis in front.
This makes a difference because it needs to know whether the final
part of the pattern, here `*', is forced to reach the end of the test
string.   So Bart's suggestion that there was a parse error is correct.

Luckily the same problem already turned up with `~', the exclusion
pattern, so fixing it with `|' is easy.
