Subject: REQUEST: ... to move a file


I request that the file `Base/_vars' be moved into `Builtins'. It uses 
a `#compdef' with several builtins and is not called from any other
completion function. It simply has nothing to do in `Base'...

I think this comes from the time when we first split things into
directories. It may have made sense then.

Bye
 Sven
