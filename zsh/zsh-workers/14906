Arguably, but it's a little tricky.

  % set these are arguments
  % unset @
  % print $*
  
  % print $@
  
  % set these are more arguments
  % print $@
  
  % print $*
  these are more arguments

And I've completely failed to convince it that $@ is active again.  You
can't assign to it normally.  Making it readonly makes sense, but remember
it's actually possible to turn that off.  Should we make readonly special
variables unreadwriteable?
