The first thing to try is "which compinit" to find out whether compinit
is set to the correct function, and if not (which is probably the case)
what it is.

Next you need to find out how compinit is being defined to what it is.
Start "zsh -x"; you'll get lots of output (if you like, use "script zsh
-x" to copy it to a file) and somewhere in there should be a reference
to how compinit is being defined.  Normally it will be something like
"autoload -U compinit".  (If the -U is missing, something funny could be
happening with aliases.)

If all that seems OK, look for the compinit in your fpath:

ls $^fpath/compinit(N)

and see what's in it.

zsh 4.3.2 (amd64-portbld-freebsd6.2)

1) i plug in a USB hard drive and see this:

# ls -lh /dev/da0*
crw-r-----  1 root  operator    0, 126 Sep 10 19:11 /dev/da0
crw-r-----  1 root  operator    0, 127 Sep 10 19:11 /dev/da0a
crw-r-----  1 root  operator    0, 128 Sep 10 19:11 /dev/da0c


2) i attach an encrypted provider:

# geli attach -d /dev/da0
Enter passphrase:


3) this creates "/dev/da0.eli", which i want to mount:

# ls -lh /dev/da0*
crw-r-----  1 root  operator    0, 126 Sep 10 19:11 /dev/da0
crw-r-----  1 root  operator    0, 129 Sep 10 19:11 /dev/da0.eli


4) i type "/dev/da0<tab>" and it auto-completes to "/dev/da0s1":

# mount /dev/da0<tab>s1


why is the auto-complete giving me a non-existent file? where should i 
poke around to fix it? thanks...
