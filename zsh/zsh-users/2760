An `echo $ZSH_VERSION' will always give you a clue as to
(approximately) which version you are using.

There are many versions of 3.1.6 floating around:

  3.1.6        -- The last official development version.  There have
                  been many MANY improvements since this; if you don't
                  mind using unstable versions, you might as well reap
                  the many benefits of using one of the versions below
                  instead of this one:

  3.1.6-pws-x  -- Official intermediate development versions compiled
                  by Peter Stephenson (pws) from selected patches from
                  zsh-workers.  Sometimes released once a week,
                  sometimes less often.

  3.1.6-bart-y -- "Intermediate intermediate" releases from Bart
                  Schaefer, to make developer's lives easier while pws
                  was away.

  3.1.6-cvs    -- Public CVS repository maintained by Tanaka Akira.  The
                  intermediate releases above are always merged into
                  the main branch, so this source tree represents the
                  current development tree the closest on average.


If you were to put them on a scale, it would be something like this:


    3.x.y, x even    3.x.y, x odd    intermediate devel      tanaka-cvs
    (e.g. 3.0.7)     (e.g. 3.1.6)    releases (pws, bart)

  <---------------------------------------------------------------------->

    least often released /                          most often released /
    most stable                                     most bleeding edge   


See the URL I mentioned before for where to get these in various formats:

As you'll notice if you look at Functions/Misc/colors from once of the
recent development versions (not 3.1.6 pure), this could be written
as:

  fg_black=$'\e[1;30m'

Your cursor positioning question has already been answered elsewhere.
