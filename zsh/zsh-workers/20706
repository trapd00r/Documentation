I use zsh 3.0.5-nt-beta-0.75 and *very happy* about Unix name semantics. 
And i use it exactly because of Unix name semantics. But there are some 
bugs in that version (which i tried to fix manually, and i have 
quick-n-dirty fixed some).
I use Unix utilities from http://unxutils.sourceforge.net/. They are 
very happy about Unix name semantics too. Even vim likes it.

The main reason i use Unix name semantics is Windows understands it too.
Cygwin, in other hand, uses names that actually does not exist in 
system. And that's why i don't like Microsoft Services for Unix as well.
