That can only happen if a single capability string is bigger thatn 1024
bytes.  Did you really see a coredump from that part of the code or you
just see it as a theoretical bug?

It is true that if the termcap database is longer that 2048 bytes and
tgetent does not accept NULL to automatically allocate buffer.
