You seem to be confusing the concepts of `existing outside the shell
function' and `exported' (visible to programs invoked from the shell).
The two are mostly, though not entirely, independent of each other.
In particular, exporting a variable does nothing to extend its lifetime.

All variables, exported or not, exist in subshells.
