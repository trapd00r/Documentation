Subject: Add --cached to git-diff completion
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Content-Disposition: inline

Not sure how to make _arguments do different things based on options given,for
git-diff ... -- <tab>
it should complete files
and for
git-diff --cached <tab>
it should only complete one commit, not two, since we're diffing
against the index
but i think the following change is still better than not. (don't add
--cached to $diff_args
since that is also used for git-diff-index and others where the
description is different).

diff --git a/Completion/Unix/Command/_git
b/Completion/Unix/Command/_git
index 3a365e5..9dcb481 100644
