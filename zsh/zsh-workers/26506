A solution to this might be to create a way to force an option to remain
set even across the end of a LOCAL_OPTIONS scope.  E.g., take any option
name and prefix it with "FORCE_" and that puts it in the "surrounding"
scope, ala "typeset -g" for variables.  That would solve some problems
for ordinary function scopes as well.

Pick some other/better word than "force".  And I'm not sure that being
able to climb up exactly one scope is enough, but it's a start.
