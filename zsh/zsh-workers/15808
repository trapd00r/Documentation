It's just a hash lookup:

	if (shfunctab->getnode(shfunctab, "r")) {
	    /* It's a function */
	}

As it would only be happening after the command name had already been
compared to (fc|history|r), I don't think it's prohibitively expensive,
though it's exactly what exec.c is going to be doing a few instructions
later.
