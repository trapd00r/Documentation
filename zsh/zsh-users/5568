Thanks Bart.

Ok, let me give the simplest case ...
Like why press <enter> all the time? Maybe I set up some
(say) preexec() function for a certain shell to automatically
accept any types string on the command line if there has been
a pause of n milliseconds.
This is not for normal use but ad hoc.

Make sense?
