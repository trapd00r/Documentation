Hi,

 in a directory there are a couple of file named:

 Example0092.txt
 Example0093.txt
 Example0094.txt
 Example0095.txt
 Example0096.txt
 Example0097.txt
 Example0098.txt
 Example0099.txt
 Example0100.txt
 Example0101.txt
 Example0102.txt

 which I want to rename to:

 Example0102.txt
 Example0103.txt
 Example0104.txt
 Example0105.txt
 Example0106.txt
 Example0107.txt
 Example0108.txt
 Example0109.txt
 Example0110.txt
 Example0111.txt
 Example0112.txt

 i.e. The first file of the new range should get the number of the
 file, which would be the next new one of the old range.
 The numbers themselves are only examples here, they could be of all
 range.

 How can I do this in a most zshy way?

 Thank you very much for any help in advance !

 Keep zshing!
