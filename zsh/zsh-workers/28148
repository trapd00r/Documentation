OK, that should be easy but since the fdtable stuff is completely
unabstracted, and since the redup case also needs that, and since
redup only sets max_zsh_fd when the old fdtable entry is nonzero, I
need to either make several more copies of the fdtable resizing code
or actually abstract it.  I should have a patch in a little bit...
but first need lunch.

thanks,
Greg
