} No, I believe, the simplest solution is to have modele.dep for every

That is exactly what I would NOT want to have happen.  Can you imagine
the confusion if zsh automatically discovered that `mv' should be loaded
from the files module?  I don't want zsh automatically picking up any
module I haven't explicitly told it about, thank you very much.

} One question - I do not quite understand logic in load_module. It looks like
} 
} if module not found
}   load module
} load module
} 
} One of these 'load module' looks redundant?

Look closely at the `if module not found' block.  It's possible that the
module may be linked but not loaded (no "handle") in that block.  In that
case a second call to load_module() will find the module, but still needs
to perform the actual loading.
