By default TAB is bound to expand-or-complete. But with current
matching/expansion completers the most sensible default is simple
complete-word.

Should not default be changed?

In any case, I think, it is nice if compinstall would support widget
selection here. It could also remind, that if you select _match or
_expand completers, you better change your default completion widget.
