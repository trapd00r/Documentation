Yes, it should do.

It's built around characters available in Unicode, and requires
conversion from UCS-4, so it's not irrelevant... but it's true that
users of ISO-8859-1 probably wouldn't realise they could use it for
accented characters.  (The manual entry hints but doesn't quite say.)

That's the right menu key on my keyboard; the Windows key is 116.
I tend to think the less I have to do with xmodmap the better, but this
time it does seem to be fairly painless.
