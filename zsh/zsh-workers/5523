This doesn't seem to fix it for me; there's still something wrong in
addmatch() on the same test:

% setopt globcomplete
% setopt glob*e<TAB>

e is still not being set, so ee is wrong, so the second call to str_cline
after `if (ee != ss + sl || (lpsuf && *lspuf))' hangs.

Further up, the code is avoiding the whole file handling branch and
following the

  test = domatch(s, patcomp, 0)

branch of the next main condition around 4344, and is not following the

  if (!test && lpre && lpsuf) {

around 4359, so there's no opportunity for e to be set.
