What effect are you trying to achieve?  The command you show does
exactly what I expect it to.  Do you mean you want David and Matt added
in the same way and the result put in foo?

usernames2=(David Matt $usernames)
foo=${(j:[return]:)~~usernames2}

Or do you mean you want the same effect as you get when outputting David
and Matt using printf, but with all the names, so that foo ends up being
joined with newlines?

foo=${(F)usernames2}
