Just checked the source for this, and it doesn't look like this is
scheduled for a change any time soon; this behavior is on purpose.

That said, you may be able to get away with closing the newly opened
file descriptor afterwards, but I think it would be better to
artificially force getpwuid() to use a higher fd, or perhaps dup2() to
move it after the call.

I'm sure it's been explained before, but why does the limit of 9 fds
exist?  Is it just because of the limitations in redirection constructs?
