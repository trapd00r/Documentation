cp /t/s/z/D/zi
             ^ cursor here (before `i')
bor@itsrm2:~> cp /tools/src/zsh-3.1.5-pws-11/Doc/z<== cursor here; no `i'
If I _now_ add `i' and do the same - I get zsh.texi

(I'm comparing to ways of life - how can I replace globcomplete. Is it
possible to have the second binding with explcit globcomplete set? Sven, I
think, it belongs to compstate as well. In this way I could have the second
bindings that sets compstate[glob] and calls standard completion. Actually,
I think, _all_ options that modify completion belong to compstate. The quick
workaround is to save globcomplete, and reset it before exit, sure).

cheers
