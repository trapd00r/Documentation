Evening!

My ~/tmp is a symlink to /otherdisk/mytmpdir, and when I do a cd
~/tmp, the prompt and pwd says I am in /otherdisk/mytmpdir and when I
do cd .. I get into /otherdisk.

What I want is doing cd ~/tmp, prompt and pwd says ~/tmp, and when I
do cd .. I get to ~/.

I think I have had it like this before, but have lost it now, what
have I missed?

     /Andy
