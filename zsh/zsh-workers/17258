This is already handled specially.  I think the code was sort of working
before execsave()/execrestore() got introduced for safety rather than
for logic.

	if (sigtrapped[SIGDEBUG]) {
	    exiting = donetrap;
	    ret = lastval;
	    dotrap(SIGDEBUG);
	    lastval = ret;
	    donetrap = exiting;
	    noerrexit = oldnoerrexit;
	}

That's going to be kind of tricky with the code quoted above, which I
missed before.  But I don't feel like digging an even deeper hole.
