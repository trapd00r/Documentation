I don't think so, why would it be?

The problem may be due to specific environment variables or a
different configuration concerning the terminal.

What is your terminal? xterm for instance sets environment variables
that are no longer valid in a different terminal and/or X11 session:

ENVIRONMENT
       Xterm sets several environment variables:

       DISPLAY
            is the display name, pointing to the X server (see  DISPLAY  NAMES
            in X(1)).
[...]
       WINDOWID
            is set to the X window id number of the xterm window.

This may be your problem...
