I am trying to setup a /etc/zshenv file for a few users on my  
system running 3.0.2.

I am trying to figure out if I have to "export" all variables set  
on /etc/zshenv OR whether that will be done automatically OR whether  
putting "ALL_EXPORT" at the top of /etc/zshenv will be enough.

Thank you.

TjL
