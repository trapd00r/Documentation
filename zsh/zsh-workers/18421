Subject: Bug with _perl_builtin_funcs
To: zw <zsh-workers@sunsite.dk>
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

There is a bug in the function _perl_builtin_funcs.  This function attempts to
build a list of perl builtin funcs by parsing the man page for perlfunc.  When
it parses the man page it assume it is plain text.  However, on RH the man page
is compressed with gzip.

Though I could see man pages being possiblly compressed with some other
compression tools(e.g. bzip2) on other platforms or in the future.

-FR.
