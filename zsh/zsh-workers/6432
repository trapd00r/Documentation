Actually, I think my patch is consistent with Zefram's remarks.  He's
saying tt() is for the font, `...' is for quotation --- that's exactly how
it is after my change.  Before, tt() was *also* introducing quotes (but
only in info, so perhaps it didn't get noticed); after, the quotes are just
the way we put them.

However, I've been negligent about putting quotes around some of my stuff,
including rewrites for parameter expansion, so I'll have a look at this
again now it's more obvious in info.  I never bothered reading
Util/zsh-development-guide until now.

Thinks like `tt((f))' work OK as long as the parentheses are balanced.  If
you have unbalanced parentheses you have to resort to
e.g. `tt(LPAR())var(flags)tt(RPAR())'.
