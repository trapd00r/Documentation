} Here's the patch against 3.0.5

I've just been testing this, and it breaks on menu completion:

zagzig% bindkey '\t' expand-or-complete-prefix 
zagzig% setopt menucomplete 
zagzig% ls zlc
             ^ with cursor here, press TAB, and you get
zagzig% ls zle_bindings.oc
                         ^ press TAB again
zagzig% ls zle_hist.oc
                     ^ press TAB again
zagzig% ls zle_hist.proc
                       ^ and so forth

Hmm, I just tried several other versions and this is broken at least back
to 3.0.0, so it's not Peter's fault.  Maybe it'll be easier to fix now,
though ...
