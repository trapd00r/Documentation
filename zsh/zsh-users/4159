} I think it's to provide a way for a process to save and restore state
} across the suspension, by installing handlers for SIGTSTP and SIGCONT.

Saving and restoring state is one reason that there are four signals to
stop a process (STOP, TSTP, TTIN, TTOU).  However, it's not the reason
that a signal is used for SIGCONT; Peter's more on target with that one.

There's no such thing as a SIGCONT handler, by the way.  The process
just picks up where it left off (possibly with system calls interrupted
depending on the operating system).  A typical TSTP handler looks like

    save_state();
    kill(getpid(), SIGSTOP);	/* STOP is not catchable */
    restore_state();
