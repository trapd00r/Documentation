Perhaps it should be renamed to termbad then.

Yuck.  issetflag() evaluates Y twice, and there aren't enough parentheses.
The fully parenthesised forms are:

#define issetflag(X, Y)		(((X) & (Y)) == (Y))
#define isanysetflag(X, Y)	((X) & (Y))
#define setflag(X, Y)		((X) |= (Y))
#define unsetflag(X, Y)		((X) &= ~(Y))

But why bother with these macros anyway?  We've always been happy with
the (much clearer) plain bit operations anyway.
