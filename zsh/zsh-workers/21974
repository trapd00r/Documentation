Valgrind spotted a leak with the ename element of parameters which
I've hacked around a few times and still not got right... the unset
function gets called before the structure is freed, as one would expect,
but it unsets the PM_TIED flag so that when the structure is freed the
ename isn't.  It's a bit hairy since if PM_SPECIAL is set we don't want
to free it.

That's enough detail.  I think the following is probably safe.
