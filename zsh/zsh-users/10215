That fixes the problem.  Thanks!  The oblique way that I ran into this
was actually through a post from 1997 (maybe) you made to zsh-users.
Someone asked how to commit a line to history without executing it, and
you offered

   bindkey -s "^X^H" "^['^A print -s ^M"

Since removing the the quote-line (^[') will introduce trouble with &
and so on which really do need to be quoted, I've had to resort to my
own widget:

   commit-to-history() {
      # zsplit current command, expand result to all its quoted fields
      # ("f1" "f2" "f3"), prepend it with a command to make it written
      # to history, and then execute it.
      BUFFER=" print -s ${${(z)BUFFER}[@]}"
      zle accept-line
   }
   zle -N commit-to-history
   bindkey "^X^H" commit-to-history

I tried using ${(qq){$(z)BUFFER}} but that didn't work.

Perhaps I could have stuck with the simpler bind, but it seems that
somehow I need to get the command into a parameter before I can split
it.  Is there any way to expand literals?
