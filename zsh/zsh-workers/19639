I've tested that on HP/UX and it works fine.

That leaves Mac OS X and IRIX as the known operating systems where zpty
doesn't work. I may try to have a look at Mac OS later this week. IRIX
has its own _getpty interface.

I'm away next week so if you're aiming for a Friday release, that would
suit me.
