The value of LS_COLORS usually comes from some startup scripts that
are in /etc/profile.d or another place loaded from /etc/profile.
Is it possible that your system is configured to source /etc/profile
even for zsh?  Perhaps some bash-ism in the script that assigns to
LS_COLORS is running afoul of syntax differences?
