I'm using something very similar:

zle -N select-from-cd-stack
select-from-cd-stack() {
    LBUFFER=$LBUFFER"~+"
    zle menu-complete
    if [[ ${LBUFFER[-2,-1]} = "~+" ]]; then
        LBUFFER=${LBUFFER[1,-3]}
    fi
}
bindkey '\ed' select-from-cd-stack

The advantage is that I can also use it for other commands like cp (for 
example when I want to copy a file from a directory in the stack to the 
current one). And since I have setopt auto_cd, I can instantly jump to 
directories in the stack.

Another (default) binding that I really like is:
bindkey "^[h" run-help
