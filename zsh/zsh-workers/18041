Hi,
     This is either a bug, or something which maybe should be noted as not
able to be done in the man page.

You can't create a local variable with the same name as a special var.

Eg:

testit()
{
    local path=foo
    echo $path
}

this echo's your path, not 'foo'. You don't get any warnings about the
assignment not working etc.

The main reason I found it was porting some shell which works in ksh and
bash to zsh compliant (which has a "path" variable).

Regards,
     - Tim
