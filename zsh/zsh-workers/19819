Some parts of the shell do use this, but in the main part where the
shell waits for a job (zwaitjob() in jobs.c) it simple calls
sigsuspend(), installing a particular signal mask.  What's more, there's
already a loop, so it's reasonably safe about bogus signals.  It looks
likes it's probably not too hard to alter, except that signals are tricky
things.
