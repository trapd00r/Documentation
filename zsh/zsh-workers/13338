This is totally non-serious, but did glitch me.  Seen in stable (3.0.8).

zsh-window-1:~% setopt autocd
zsh-window-1:~% mkdir foo
zsh-window-1:~% cd foo
zsh-window-1:~/foo% ..
zsh-window-1:~% cd foo

zsh-window-2:~% rmdir foo

zsh-window-1:~/foo% ..
zsh: is a directory: ..
zsh-window-1:~/foo% cd ..
zsh-window-1:~%

If this has been fixed, could it be added to 50cd.ztst please?  It
hadn't been on my last (v.old) checkout.   Uhm ... 11th May 2000.
*blush*

In fact, in that version:

zsh-window-1:~/foo% ..
zsh: permission denied: ..
zsh-window-1:~/foo% cd ..
cd: no such file or directory: ..

And this is "zsh -f" obviously.  If the 2000-05-11 behaviour is still
there ... ow.
