Ok, this is a bit obscure.

I maintain several packages for the fink project on OS X, which,
essentially, is a debian package management system.  To compile and
install stuff, one typically embeds a shell script as a here document. 
For example

http://xanana.ucsc.edu/fink_10.4/10.4/unstable/main/finkinfo/sci/apbs.info

has the lines

InstallScript: <<
#!/bin/zsh -efv
make install DESTDIR=%d
rm -Rf **/CVS  # fink validate complains if this junk is left behind.
mkdir -p %i/share/%n
...
<<

We are required to invoke the shell command with -v, which I hate because
I have to watch all sorts of junk in my 600 startup files scroll by.  So
if I could invoke zsh with absolutely no sourcing of any file, and more
importantly, could be guaranteed that no user will put something
unexpected into their /etc/zshenv file, it would be nice.  Usually I wind
up just using /bin/sh but sometimes I want to use a zsh feature.

Thanks.

Bill
