Hi.

When I do the following:
  cd sp<TAB>

It takes most of ten seconds before it completes for me. I tried to do an
strace on it, and I saw the following:

[pid 22114] access("/home/blackie/bin/cd", X_OK) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
[pid 22114] access("/usr/X11R6/bin/cd", X_OK) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)

[pid 22114] access("/opt/mosml/bin/cd", X_OK) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
<SNIP>

My path is quite long, so there is a huge number of directories it must go
through.

Is there an option I can set, which makes my cd command faster?

Kind Regards Jesper.
