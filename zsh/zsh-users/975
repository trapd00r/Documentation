Hi fellows!

i love that little feature within vim
if you have a number say 20 and you press control-a with vim it becomes
21 while control-x does 19.

our zsh is such a great shell that i am almost sure i can do that
at the prompt, too but how should i do it?

any clues?


btw: i really love my zsh and i miss it every time, where there is no zsh around!
