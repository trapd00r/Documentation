But which one is the correct one to use?  Are they all compatable with
each other and the compiler/runtime being use to build zsh?  Do they all
have an iconv.h header (and if so, how/where)?  I think a little better
detection in configure might be appropriate here, but without a Mac OS-X
environment it's difficult to discern this.

Perhaps it would be good for configure to #undef HAVE_ICONV_H if the
library isn't found?
