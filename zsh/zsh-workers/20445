Subject: compinit dumps too many files for autoloading

If I am using a complicate completion such as _perforce which defines
its own functions, then run compinit again, all those functions are
marked for autoloading in .zcompdump.  This is problematic because the
functions in question are tested thus in _perforce (_cvs works
similarly):

(( $+functions[_perforce_filetypes] )) ||
_perforce_filetypes() {
 ...
}

When _perforce is loaded, the test sees that the function is already
marked for autoloading and doesn't define it.

It's not very serious since compinit isn't usually run again.  I'm not
sure what the fix is.  However, it's not clear to me compinit should be
marking files for autoload unless it found them by searching $fpath.
