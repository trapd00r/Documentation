I've tested it under IRIX 6.2 and IRIX 6.4 and it worked well. 
So it may a problem with the compiler. Helmut and Anthony check the 
compiler version with `cc -version`
I use 'MIPSpro Compilers: Version 7.2.1.1m'. It seems to work. 
Or try to use gcc. If it's not a problem of the linker it should
solve the problem too.

on the compiler
