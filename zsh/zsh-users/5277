Here's something I figure is possible in zsh, but I don't know how -
I'd like to be able to do an ls in a directory of source code while
its being built, and basically say: show me all the .c files for which
there doesn't exist a .o file.   Right now I'm using:

ls -1 *.[co] | cut -f 1 -d"." | uniq -c | grep 1

but there has to be a zsh way to do that without 3 pipes.  Any ideas?

Scott
