Did you try my script? kill -TERM `pid foo bar baz` will kill all foo, bar,
baz named processes.  And of course it can be improved, since sed is not
necessary:

pid () {
    setopt localoptions extendedglob
    local i
    for i
    do
        echo "${(M)${(M)${(f)$(ps acx)}:%* $i #}## #<->}"
    done
}

Where can I find your PGP key?  I tried finger -l, your web page and the
key servers with no luck.
