If we change the `8' to `CHAR_BIT' (which will need to be determined at
configuration time if there isn't a limits.h), it would be more
portable.  But we are assuming 8-bit bytes, as well as ASCII, in a lot
of character handling code.

It might be wise to do a configuration check for the smallest type of
at least 32 bits.  There are a number of bitfields that could use
this.

We should have a union there, as we do elsewhere.  long and void * are
sufficient, but it might be neater to have some other pointer types too
(it would reduce casting, and would not decrease efficiency).
