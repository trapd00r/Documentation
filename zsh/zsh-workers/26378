So, here's one good use of ZSH_PATCHLEVEL, I guess:

I updated my sandbox from 1.4517 to 1.4520, ran make, started up zsh and
got a stream of errors about bad options to compdef and failures to
autoload completion functions.

Must have something to do with workers/26366, but I don't know what.  A
"make clean" fixed everything up.
