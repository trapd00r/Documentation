} I think the error message is correct and should remain; the test data
} is what needs to be fixed.

I don't think so ... closing stdout should not produce an error from a
builtin that does output.  E.g. here's bash:

[schaefer@zagzig schaefer]$ echo foo >&-
[schaefer@zagzig schaefer]$ echo $?
0
[schaefer@zagzig schaefer]$ 

The "print" command has to execute, e.g. in case it's given -P and there
are side-effects of the prompt expansion due to the PROMPT_SUBST option,
but it must not produce any output and it definitely shouldn't return 
nonzero.
