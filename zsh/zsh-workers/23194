It shouldn't cause problems: as wcs_nicechar() is already supposed to
handle printable wide characters cleanly, the return values may already
contain metafied characters.  See the end of the function where a normal
printable multibyte character is metafied.  By "at this point", I meant
specifically in the branch handling of non-printable wide characters or
other parse failures.
