Hi,

I've just upgraded my system to Mandrake 10.1, and I'm having a very serious
problem.  Zsh is core dumping when I navigate through completion choices with
menu completion.  At first I though it happened randomly, but I'm now able to
consistently replicate the problem.  I've tried the latest cvs code, and
almost every version going back to 4.0.9, and the problem persists.  I've
also trimmed my zshrc file to just 3 lines:

autoload -U compinit
compinit
zstyle ':completion:*' menu scroll=0 select=2

I compiled the cvs version with --enable-zsh-debug and get this from the core
file:

Core was generated by `zsh'.
Program terminated with signal 11, Segmentation fault.

warning: current_sos: Can't read pathname for load map: Input/output error

What else can I try to fix the problem?

Thanks.
