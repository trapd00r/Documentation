Word splitting is vastly different in the two cases.  It happens within
the words of $action in the second case, but does not in the first case.

Also in the second example, only "alias -g" aliases are expanded.  Not
that I think that was the intended behavior, but ...

} I don't think we *need* both

Yes, we do.  There are uses for that splitting behavior.

} What about a single unquoted space to indicate no matches?  Why do we
} need the space at all?  Surely if there's nothing there it indicates no
} possible matches?  It's all a bit Zen-like.

There's a reason for that, too, but I'll have to dig in the archives a
bit to find it.
