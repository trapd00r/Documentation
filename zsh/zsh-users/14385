from zshmisc(1):

ALTERNATE FORMS FOR COMPLEX COMMANDS
        Many of zsh=E2=80=99s complex commands have alternate forms.  =
These =20
particular versions of complex commands should  be  con=E2=80=90
        sidered  deprecated  and  may  be  removed  in the future.  =20
The versions in the previous section should be preferred
        instead.=
