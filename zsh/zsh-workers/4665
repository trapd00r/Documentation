} What was wrong? Is it possible to explicitly say (a la apache) which modules
} should be compiled in statically? Would be a nice addition.

Read the INSTALL file.  You need to add the module names you want to the
file Src/modules-bltin (why the missing vowels, someone?) in the build
tree (not the source tree, if the two trees are not the same).  If you
don't do this, the modules in Src/xmods.conf in the source tree are the
ones included by default (I don't think that's documented anywhere).

(Boy there are a lot of parens in that paragraph.)

There's a lot of information about modules buried in the Src/mk*.sh and
related files that probably ought to get moved to a file in Etc/ with a
more obvious name.
