Subject: renice +20 %%
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii" ; format="flowed"

Hi.

I can't see how I would write a shell function that would do something like

   renice +20 %%

I propose an option to the jobs builtin to output only the pid of the 
specified job, so one could write this:

   jr() { renice +20 $(jobs -x %%) }

Thanks

Dave
