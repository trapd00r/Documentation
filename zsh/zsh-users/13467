I've asked this question two times in irc but no one seemed to have
found answer.

I have those two directories in my home directory: .gnome2/
and .gnome2_private.

When I type "cd .gnome2<TAB>", it first completes to "cd .gnome2/" but
then if I type <TAB> again, it auto-completes with the directories
*inside* ".gnome2/". I would expect it to offer me to complete between
".gnome2/" and ".gnome2_private/".

Can this behavior be configured differently?
