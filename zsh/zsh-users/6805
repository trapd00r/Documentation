That's depends on your terminal emulator and not zsh. By using Ctrl-V
or cat -v or whatever, you can see what your terminal program sends for
a particular key. Chances are, it'll send nothing useful for
Meta-Shift-Backspace. You can use X key translation X resources to make
xterm produce your own escape sequence for a particular key combination,
though.
