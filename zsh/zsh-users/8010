What do I have to do to get

PATH=$PATH:/bi<TAB>

to complete the "/bi" to /bin"

and

svn file:///ho<TAB>

to complete the /ho to /home ?

I've read the options chapter in the zsh manual front to back and back to
front but can't find anything.
This works in bash and I find the lack of this feature very painful.
