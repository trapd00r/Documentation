I don't think we have direct access to the repository, so add/remove is
all we can do.

The convention is to put the name of the new file in each removed file's
commit log, and vice-versa.  That means a whole lot of individual commits
rather than one big one, though.

It might also be a good idea to "cvs tag" everything before doing any of
this.  I know Peter has tagged the prereleases, but there have been some
intervening commits.
