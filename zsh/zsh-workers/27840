I think the real problem would be losing anonymous CVS.  We have so few
active developers I don't think management of the archive is a major
problem.

Personally, I have no more objection to using git than any other system
(I use the git mirror when CVS is down), but I don't think there's any
overriding reason for changing.  If there had been we'd probably already
have switched to Subversion.  Delaying a commit by a day or two is a
complete non-issue in our case.
