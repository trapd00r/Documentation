} typeset creates local variables as in ksh.

Well, that's at least a reason, but it seems silly to have a special
variant of typeset called "local" which rejects certain flags like -x,
but then add "oh, by the way, typeset creates local variables too."

Is it even possible from inside a shell function to create a variable
which has a special property (such as integer, or right-justified) and
is NOT local to the function BUT is NOT exported into the environment?

It seems as though this *should* be possible, which (coupled with the
existence of "local") is why I say that it's counterintuitive to have
integer/typeset/etc. create locals.  It would make much more sense if
"typset -x" always created environment variables, "typeset" always
created shell global variables, and "local" always created locals.
