Just have been testing a little more...

Looking at C-X ? trace tells me that

trace _mua_mailboxes:35(case)> mbox_names=( Mailboxes mailboxes =alert =bugtraq =tripwire ! =out/andy =out/heidi ~/News/my.articles +postponed =root =weberror =wwwcron =postmaster =webmaster =backupmaster =ard-webtechnik =brnet =junk =junk.spiegl =orakel =sub/cus/rundbriefe =sub/cus/rundbriefe.muc =sub/mutt =sub/zsh =sub/zsh-workers =sub/linux/linux-ug =sub/linux/debian.security =sub/linux/debian.announce =sub/linux/debian.commercial =sub/linux/debian.user.de =sub/linux/debian.user =sub/kira =sub/akte ) 

is being reduced to

trace _multi_parts:94(while else)> compadd -O tmp1 - =alert =bugtraq =tripwire =out =out =root =weberror =wwwcron =postmaster =webmaster =backupmaster =ard-webtechnik =brnet =junk =junk.spiegl =orakel =sub =sub =sub =sub =sub =sub =sub =sub =sub =sub =sub =sub =sub

Is that intended?  It would sound more logical to me if the full paths were 
kept.

And after
 % muttf -f  m<TAB>
I get these completions offered:
 mailbox specification
 mailboxes 
 mailbox file
 Mail/            movies/          mutt_1.2-1.deb 

Where does that "mailboxes" come from?
Thanks,
 Andy.
