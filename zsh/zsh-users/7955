Hi all,

First time poster to this list, but I've been lurking for a while. Anyway.

I recently upgraded to zsh-4.2.1. I have always used some lines in my .zshr=
c to use
LS_COLORS with completion lists/menus:

zmodload -i zsh/complist
eval $(dircolors ~/.dir_colors)
zstyle ':completion:*' list-colors "${(s.:.)LS_COLORS}"

This has always worked fine, but with the recent upgrade to 4.2.1, it no lo=
nger works
and I get a default set of colours, although I'm not sure where they're com=
ing from -
the only stuff that seems to be highlighted is executables in green, direct=
ories in
red, and symlinks in blue.

The LS_COLORS variable itself seems to be good and well, as they work fine =
with ls
itself.

Thanks in advance,
Tom
