In which way is it more "mathematically" correct?

Is that because -3² is -9? 

But ** is not ^, it's a binary operator whose shape reminds that
of multiply, like a multiply++. And even then, POSIX's ^ in bc
is handled as -3^2 = 9.

It could be a good idea to ask ksh, POSIX/bc and perl authors for
the rationale behind their choices.
