Point of order ... select-word-style is not a widget, so it should not
be in the Functions/Zle directory in the distribution.  I think it should
be in Functions/Misc instead.

I have a hard time deciding about match-words-by-style ... it's not a
widget, but it's not callable except from a widget.  However, it most
likely ought to be Functions/Misc as well.
