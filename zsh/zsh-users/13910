We might as well put that right.  Note that printjob() uses stdout if
it's for a command where the user has requested a status output; that
doesn't seem to apply here.

printjob() doesn't currently do the right thing even if called at that
point.  There's no reason it couldn't, but I doubt if the result would
be a code saving or a clarification.

... the point being this is *interactive* job control based around a
terminal session.  It's not a general purpose mini-process-management
system.
