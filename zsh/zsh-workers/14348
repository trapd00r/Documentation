Subject: PATCH: global_export
Date: Tue, 15 May 2001 10:58:31 +0100
From: Peter Stephenson <pws@csr.com>

I was just writing some more option tests and I discovered a bug with
global_export.  Probably no-one uses this, it's there to allow you to have
a consistent behaviour of flags by unsetting it, because it always annoyed
me that sometimes the effect became global without you asking for it.
Unfortunately it prevents the -g option from working.

% unsetopt globalexport
% fn() { typeset -gx exportme=INSIDE; }
% exportme=OUTSIDE
% fn
% print $exportme
OUTSIDE

Here's the fix.
