Subject: 'K' subscript flag with associative array?

Hi guys, what am I doing wrong here?  Shouldn't this:

  zsh% echo ${(k)functions[(K)_*]}

give all function names starting with '_'?

It gives me nothing; the 'R' subscript flag does seem
to work for matching against the bodies of functions
and returning the names of those functions.

thanks,
Greg
