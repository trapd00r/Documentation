Hallo to all,
I have encountered a strange behavour of the zsh on AIX 3.2 .
The zsh (2.5 and 3.1) does not execute scripts that are passed to the
/bin/sh . The sh drops the error message:
: 0402-026 The specified data is not a valid identifier.
This happens on all RS6000 AIX 3.2 Machines of our cluster. The ksh
has no problem with that. ( sh stupidskript ) Now comes the really od
thing! When you execute the ksh with "exec ksh" and then the zsh again
with "exec zsh", everything works fine again???????
This happens with EVERY skript that has no #!/bin/... in it (is passed
to the sh I beleave) or #!/bin/sh in it. Skripts with #!/bin/ksh work
fine. The command "sh skript" does not work too, of couse.
I would be very glad if someone could help me. On all other computers
( HPs, Linux-PCs, SGI ) the skript execution works with the zsh.
The Computers are IBM RS6000 with the Power2 Processor, all with AIX 3.2
 ( 320H, 350, 370, 390, 3BT, 3CT).
If this is a known AIX bug or a FAK, I want to apologize.

      I would be very glad if someone could help me.
                                  Greetings          Marco
