Wow, good job, Peter!  The only ones you seem to have missed are:

7414, fix info doc for makeinfo 3.12f
7436, change the way the last command in a pipeline is exec'd

Unless of course I missed the same ones you did, which is possible.  Truth
to tell, I "missed" 7436 on purpose and was watching for whether you would
include it -- did you intentionally leave it out?

There does appear to be one other problem -- there is a complete copy of
each of two versions of the _xterm completer in Completion/X/_xterm.  I
think the top one is the one to keep.
