Thanks for your comments i did most of the modifications as you have
suggested, before i upload to cooker[1], i'll be glad to know if you
think[2] the default config is ok. The (s)rpm is based here :

ftp://ftp.mandrakesoft.com:/pub/chmou/zsh-3.1.6dev17-1mdk.i586.rpm
ftp://ftp.mandrakesoft.com:/pub/chmou/zsh-3.1.6dev17-1mdk.src.rpm
