Hello list,

Is there a configuration parameter or option that enables path completion after equals, for example, export ENVVAR=/some/path/name?  I've been using zsh for some months now, and this is the only thing that bash does that I find missing in zsh.  But perhaps the behavior can be turned on in some way?

TIA
