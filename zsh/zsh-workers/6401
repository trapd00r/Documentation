Subject: pws-20 parameter completion can't handle new syntax
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Not surprisingly, this doesn't work (with new-style completion stuff loaded):

zagzig% echo ${"comp<TAB>
<BEEP>

Just to show that the syntax is valid:

zagzig% echo ${"compconfig"}
2n _complete ./Completion/Core/compinit.dump correct to:

(This works because of PWS's INULL change in subst.c; it used to error with
`closing brace expected').

Here's another, probably unrelated, unexpected behavior:

zagzig% echo ${comp
               ^place cursor on "c" and press TAB
zagzig% echo ${comp} 
                     ^cursor is now here, but there is no parameter
                      named "comp".
