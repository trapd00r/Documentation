I think the issue was mostly with typeset -U.  Looking at the
description of -U, it suggests that it ought to work for
colon-separated things like PATH anyway.  Hmm...  No, it doesn't work
for random variables, only for special ones.

So, this patch *is* still worthwhile.  It ought to allow me to create
new colon-separated variables, and have the shell eliminate
duplicates.  Of course, what we really want is programmable setting
and reading of variables, like ksh93 has.
