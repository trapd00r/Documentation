I do not understand you.  Yes, I agree, that the entire value of $x should
be treated as part of the brace expansion, but this is not what happens
right now, as the result is two words, `{x' and `y,z}a', with braces
appearing in the result and not used for brace expansion.  I thought that
this is not what you expect.  What I would expect is 3 word result,

x ya za

Noone.  The result will be 4 words,

wa x ya za

This is different from the result of {w,x} {y,z}a which is w x ya za.  Or
do you have some more reasonable alternative?

Almost, but the order is different:

px ya px yb qx ya qx yb
