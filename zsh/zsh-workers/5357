Bash doesn't even have arrays, apart from "$@", of course.  Try it in
ksh, and remember you need "${f[@]}" because the bracing rules are
more strict, and you'll find it elides the whole thing as with the
patch.

Taking a @ subscript was never a well-defined thing to do on a scalar,
whether or not it happens to be so with a zsh extension; its essential
purpose is to provide word splitting for arrays in strings, so zero
elements gives zero words.  (And if it leaves a null argument on the
line for an empty scalar, I would argue that's inconsistently
implemented.)

It seems pretty clear to me the shell is just plain broken without it.
