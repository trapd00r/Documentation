Have a look at these two messages on the Linux kernel mailing list.
You'll want to scroll to the end of the first one.
  http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0404.1/1509.html
  http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0404.2/1037.html

Basically, the suggestion is that it should be possible to set resource
limits numerically with e.g. `ulimit 4 1024'. I can see how this could
be worth a lot to anyone implementing a new resource limit. Is that
difficult to implement? Would it be vaguely portable?
