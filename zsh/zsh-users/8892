} Indeed that ought to tell you something?

Yes, it told me that everything appeared to be in proper working order
up to that point.

However, the _complete_debug output indicates that the $_comps array
is empty -- or, at least, it doesn't have the entries for "cd" and
"-default-" which is a pretty good indication that it doesn't have
entries for anything -- so somehow all that initialization has been
lost.

The initialization did occur -- otherwise, _complete_debug would not
have worked -- so something else is causing _comps to become empty.
