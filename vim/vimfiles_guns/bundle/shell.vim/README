This plug-in aims to improve the integration between Vim and its environment by providing functions to switch to full-screen (see the screenshots at http://peterodding.com/code/vim/shell/screenshots), open URLs in the user's default web browser and execute external commands in the background without opening a command prompt window. A DLL is included to perform these things on Windows, while on UNIX external commands are used.

For more information about the plug-in please refer to its homepage or the project page on GitHub:

ALTERNATIVES
After publishing this plug-in I found that vimscript #687 and vimscript #2596 also implement full-screen on Windows using a similar approach. I prefer the effect of my plug-in because it seems to hide window decorations more effectively. Also note that my plug-in was developed independently of the other two.
