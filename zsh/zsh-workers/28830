% echo ${(k)functions[(<tab>
---- subscript flags
I  -- all keys matched by subscript as pattern
K  -- all values where subscript matched by key as pattern
R  -- all values matched by subscript as pattern
e  -- interpret * or @ as a single key
i  -- any one key matched by subscript as pattern
k  -- any one value where subscript matched by key as pattern
r  -- any one value matched by subscript as pattern

Ie, you want I, not K. What K/k does is somewhat weird, in that it
interprets the keys of the arrays as patterns and check which of those
match the given subscript. With I/i you don't need to specify ${(k)
either, it defaults to showing the keys, but you can give ${(v) to
instead get the values.
