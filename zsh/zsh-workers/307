Well, I removed the signames.h file and did a reconfig.  I had already
patched the configure script so that it doesn't use grep -q.

Did a new make and installed.

Same crash.  I noticed that it doesn't crash if OpenWindows isn't running.

Hope this helps.  Meanwhile, I'm back on a previous version.
