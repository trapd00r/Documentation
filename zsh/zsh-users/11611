Subject: where is ZSH license ?
MIME-Version: 1.0

i did even Google with "zsh license" and all i got was this:
http://www.zsh.org/mla/workers/2000/msg01077.html

is there no official document of ZSH License. when i tried to search
http://zsh.dotsrc.org/  i was directed to
http://zsh.sunsite.dk/FAQ/zshfaq.txt which has no information about
ZSH copyright

:(
