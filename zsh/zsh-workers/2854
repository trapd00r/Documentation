Problem is, history-beginning-search-backward only got added a few
versions ago and has never been bound, while the
history-search-backward behaviour, partly inherited from tcsh, has
been around for years and years whether documented or not and I don't
believe I'm the only one to have been relying on it.  If it confused
me --- and I'm supposed in principal to be clued up --- I can't
imagine the general confusion will be any less.

It should go in the NEWS file when the release becomes official and
I'll put it in the FAQ.
