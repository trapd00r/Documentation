I'm new at using zsh. Working through a tutorial.

I read that 

   Using the -m flag in conjunction with -l, you can specify a pattern.
   (don't forget to quote the pattern!). Then, only commands matching
   the pattern will be displayed. 

So for example, if 

   fc -l -300 -285 

shows that I used vim in a command a number of times, to isolate only the
'vim' occurrences should I not type

   fc -lm "vim" -300 -285    ?

Or do you need the entire command line? (That would be a severe
limitation I think).

Thanks,

Nick
