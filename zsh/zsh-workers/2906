I don't think this is a matter of backward compatibility, but
more of a matter of creating a decent environment for new users.

I realize most people on this list probably have a large list
of compctl's, and override all the default ones.  But this
matter concerns new users rather than power users.  What do
we save by removing the default compctl's?  Maybe 100 bytes, and
a few micro-seconds of startup time.

Zsh should (by default) start in a usable state.  I hate tools that
require extensive customization before they are usable.  Let's not
take zsh down that path.
