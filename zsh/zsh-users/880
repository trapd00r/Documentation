Hi - two quick questions:

1------------------------

up-line-or-search in ZLE is broken:

 sgi19 ttyq2 ~ 9 ~ > 
"^[[A" is up-line-or-search
 sgi19 ttyq2 ~ 9 ~ > ls
Gfx/          SunOs/        etc/          mail          web/
Mail/         Twinklestar/  ini/          man/
News/         bin/          lib/          stuff/
 sgi19 ttyq2 ~ 10 ~ > 
[[[ Presses Cursor Up ---> "^[[A" ]]]
 sgi19 ttyq2 ~ 10 ~ > 
 sgi19 ttyq2 ~ 10 ~ > l
[[[ Presses Cursor Up ---> "^[[A" ]]]
 sgi19 ttyq2 ~ 10 ~ > l

It's definitely not the described action for up-line-or-search; can anyone
develop a patch for it please?

2------------------------

A friend of mine has asked if it would be possible to add an option to
compctl that alters the order/method of sorting that occurs when you
complete/expand.

Eg: have the user select alphanumeric, date, size order for the sort
with options for compctl, but default to alphanumeric.

What do you think?

-------------------------

Thats it; thanks in advance,
