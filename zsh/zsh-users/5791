Agreed with one question - currently I need to subscribe to one list only,
i.e. mail is forwarded zsh-announce -> zsh-users -> zsh-workers. As
subscriber to zsh-workers I definitely would not like to confirm posts to
zsh-users. If this can be done - please, switch to confirmation mode.

I would prefer if both lists were protected.

I am not sure is there is anybody officially in charge ... Geoff, Peter,
Bart?
