~/src/she* has 1 match - a directory ``~/src/shells''.  Also, ~/src is
the only thing starting with s in ~ if that's relevant.

I just got a dump at the same line - during startup - when it's going 
through the init files /etc/z* + ~/.z* - but it's not occuring every time
which makes it somewhat more troublesome.  It may be a memory allocation
problem from elsewhere manifesting there, but I don't know anything about
that code so ....
