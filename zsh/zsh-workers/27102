Interesting historical development; since those are closed I don't think
that's an issue (if someone did want to run iconv I wouldn't stop them).

Actually, I think there's an argument that having UTF-8 in the new file
is a good thing:  smart editors will spot what encoding to use, and
anyone copying in a name will get the same encoding.  Otherwise it could
potentially start filling up with ISO-8859-1 or anything else.

Keeping non-ASCII characters out of the source would be a smart idea,
however.
