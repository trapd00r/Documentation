This is in preparation for the next release.

I wrote it on the assumption that we were taking up Oliver's suggestion
of re-expanding the prompt when the line editor is interrupted and
restarted, but it looks like Wayne's patch actually more or less makes
reset-prompt redundant by doing it on all refreshes (which seems like
overkill).  Testing trashedzle might be a better bet.  (I can have a go
at that.)

Oliver suggested moving some stuff.  I will move NEWS and FEATURES into
the top directory (and change the .distfiles) when I commit this.

 Zsh is a shell with lots of features.  For a list of some of these, see the
-file Etc/FEATURES, and for the latest changes see Etc/NEWS.  For more

 details, see the documentation.
 
 Possible incompatibilities
 ---------------------------
 
+Currently the only known incompatibilities between 4.2.0 and later
+versions are minor: IPv6 addresses must be specified in
+square brackets in the zftp module and function system; special
+traps for pseudosignals ZERR, DEBUG and EXIT are no longer executed
+inside other traps (users may well have assumed this was the case anyway
+since the behaviour was not explicity documented).  See the NEWS file for

 Changes since zsh version 4.2.0
 -------------------------------
 
+- A new `try block' and `always block' syntax has been introduced
+  to make it easier to ensure the shell runs important tidy-up code
+  in the event of an error.  It also runs after a break, continue, or
+  return, including a return forced by the ERR_RETURN option,
+  but not an exit, which is immediate).  The syntax is:
+    `{'  try-block-list `}' `always' `{' always-block-list `}'
+  where no newline or semicolon may appear between `}' and `always'.
+  This is compatible with all previous valid zsh syntax as an `always'
+  at that point used to be a syntax error.  For example,
+    { echo Code run in current shell } always { echo Tidy-up code }
+
+- A new zle widget reset-prompt has been added to re-expand the current
+  prompt.  Note that this does not take account of changes to the
+  prompt variables themselves, only the expansion of the text.  The
+  same effect is now forced by a job change notification, making
+  the %j prompt escape and %(j..) ternary expression more useful.
+
 - The zftp module supports ports following the hostname in the normal suffix
   notation, `host:port'.  This requires IPv6 colon-style addresses to be
   specified in suitably quoted square brackets, for example:
