While working with a terminal which didn't support zle as well as it
should have I came across an inconsistency in the behaviour of the
history substitution operator.

In particular, a substitution of the form !?string[?] when coupled with
the % operator to retrieve the word which matched the ?string? search.
(According to the man page)

Behaviour I noticed, and can track back as far as 2.6-beta13 was that
the word _following_ the word matched would be retrieved. I had a copy
of 2.6-beta10 sitting on an old machine which did not exhibit the bug.

I checked with a copy of 3.1.1-beta which I downloaded this evening from
the Australian mirror site. The bug was still in evidence. It would seem
to be a simple off-by-one bug. I include both a trace of the problem,
and a proposed patch below.

I would appreciate a response so that I can make sure this patch was
received and know whether it solves the problem of a useful feature being
unworkable.
