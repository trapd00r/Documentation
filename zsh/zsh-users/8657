Shouldn't it be possible to just tell zsh that when there are no
completions for an argument, it should fall back to completing files?

There are indeed many commands where I find that "smart" completion is
a nuisance. This wouldn't solve the problem for all of them, but it
would go a long way. I really don't like completion definitions that,
for instance, only let me complete files matching *.mp3. Maybe a
separate key binding for 'complete files', as is being discussed, is
still the correct solution, I don't know, but it would be nice if some
standard key binding were available in the default configuration.
