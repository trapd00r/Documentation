Subject: PATCH: $history index in prompt_bart_precmd
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

I finally exceeded my $HISTSIZE in one window and noticed that my prompt
was no longer updating.  $history behaves as an assoc indexed on the
current history number, which means it gets leading empty elements as
things fall off the front -- but $#history reflects the actual number of
non-empty elements, e.g. it's never more than $HISTSIZE-1.

There is, however, some kind of bug with interpretation of the keys for
$history, because e.g. $history[3-1] == $history[3].  (It should yield
the empty string, as there isn't any hash table value for key "3-1".)
