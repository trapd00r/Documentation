qtplay is a comand-line wrapper around Quick Time for Mac OS X. (See 
http://home.earthlink.net/~rainbowflight/#qtplay)  I don't know if we 
want to include a mac-only program in the standard suite, but I thought 
I'd send it in in any case, in case it's wanted.  Let me know if there 
are any questions or suggestions...
