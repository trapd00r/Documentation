Hello,

today I recompiled my Zsh after some time and wanted to read the docs
about the new cdr function etc., but it seems like the whole section is
only included in zsh.texi, but not in the man pages... is there
something wrong or is it just me? (I looked at contrib.yo, but saw no
problem other than that the heading is much longer than all the others;
but I have no idea about how Yodl works.)
