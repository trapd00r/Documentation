That's this test:

 declare +m
1:Differences of declare and typeset
?(eval):1: bad option: -m

I noticed the missing `m' in the list of declare options when checking
the completion function was consistent with the code. I assumed that
was an oversight.

I was probably unwise in getting side tracked into changing that sort
of thing but why does declare have that difference to typeset? I can't
see that it serves any useful purpose. But given that someone bothered
testing it, maybe there is. Bash has no conflicting -m option. Or can I
just remove the test?
