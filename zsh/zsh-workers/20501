I improved a few things in that patch and checked it in.  The
improvements were:

 - In my safety fix in builtin.c, made sure that errno doesn't get
   changed by fdopen() if the open() call failed.

 - In lockhistfile() in hist.c, delayed the fdopen() so that it doesn't
   interfere with the locking logic.

 - In gettempname(), made the logic for adding a separating '.' between
   the prefix and the suffix depend on the presence of a non-NULL
   prefix, not on the setting of the use_heap variable.  (The end result
   is the same, but the function's behavior is more logical.)
