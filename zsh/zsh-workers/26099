Now that you ask, I don't know. I guess I'm just used to it.

I don't know if commands executed in a chpwd hook function are added to
the history (they shouldn't in my oppinion), but I'm not explicitly
changing it in there. This is a sample .env.rc I'm using in a project:

	# vim:filetype=3Dzsh

	export BASE=3D$PWD
	export PERL5LIB=3D"$PWD/code/"

	/usr/bin/ctags --languages=3D"Perl" -R "$PWD"

Regards,
Jonas
