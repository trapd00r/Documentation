Hi,

 In a shell script a variable foo is set to 2.0:3.5:0.2

	a=2.0:3.5:0.2

 is there a any short one liner to convert the contents of a into
 the contents which would result from an assignment like

    a=(2.0 3.5 0.2)

 I looked throuch man zshall but since I dont know the (englisch) term
 for what I am searching I didn't find anything.

 Thank you very much for any help in advance!
 Have a nice weekend!
