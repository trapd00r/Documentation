From: Peter Stephenson <pws@csr.com>

I've just uploaded
  ftp://ftp.zsh.org/zsh/development/zsh-4.1.0-dev-tar.gz
  ftp://ftp.zsh.org/zsh/development/zsh-4.1.0-dev-tar.bz2

which uses autoconf 2.50 as promised.

This includes the line number changes for trial --- more environments have
their own local line numbering; see if you prefer it this way.
