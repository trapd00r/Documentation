Yes, I'm using Linux here so I checked that. That said, I think there
is more than one fork of procps. I've checked both Debian and SuSE (and
judging by the version numbers of 3.2.1-2 and 2003.9.20-6, they have
different ps commands).

You'll notice that I kept that change in my patch. I saw that you'd
done that in yours and it didn't do any harm on Linux so I kept that
part of your change.

I just had a look at _killall's history. Seems the change to cut out
command names was in 13312 and that not using `ps ho comm' was
intentional. With regard to 13314, I think it should just be removing a
leading hyphen.
