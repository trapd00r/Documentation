I have a question about zsh's bindkey.
When using tcsh(tcsh-6.05), I wrote my bindkeys like this.

(.tcshrc)  bindkey ^W backward-delete-word

And when I press ^W like this situation, it works as follows.

(tcsh)% ls /usr/local/bin/^W 
	|
	v
(tcsh)% ls /usr/local/

I think it is very useful and I want to use this in zsh.
But in zsh(I'm using zsh-2.6-beta8),even if I wrote in .zshrc like this,

(.zshrc)  bindkey "^W" backward-delete-word

it doesn't work like tcsh, only works like this.

(zsh)% ls /usr/local/bin/^W 
	|
	v
(zsh)% ls 

Could someone help me????
