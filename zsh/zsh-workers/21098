Aren't two dashes a GNU thing, not POSIX?

Probably not.

In general we've never tried to support old versions of software except
where the old version continues to be widely distributed (such as if
Solaris comes with an old version).

Any reason for removing gview from the commands it completes? Is that a
Gnome variant of gv? We probably should complete postscript files for
kghostview too.
