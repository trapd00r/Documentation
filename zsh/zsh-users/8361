FWIW, it's too late to get this into Solaris 10.  It will ship with 4.2.1
plus a handful of patches.  I expect to make 4.2.2 available in S10 update
1, along with some (basic) completion functions for S10 functionality which
I'll push here first.

As a general thing, is it useful to people here to try to have the latest
zsh incorporated into Solaris, given the time lag between when I can put it
in and when it actually gets released (even Solaris Express releases can be
more than a month after the gates close)?  Do people just tend to ignore
the installed zsh and build their own or grab a package from blastwave or
other such service?

Thanks,
Danek
