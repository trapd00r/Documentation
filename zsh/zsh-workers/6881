+To use a newly created keymamp, it should be linked to tt(main).  Hence
+the sequence of commands to create and use a new keymap `tt(mymap)'
+initialized from the tt(emacs) keymap (which remains unchanged) is:
+
+example(bindkey -N mymap emacs
+bindkey -A mymap main)
+
+Note that while `tt(bindkey -A) var(newmap) tt(main)' will work when
+var(newmap) is tt(emacs) or tt(viins), it will not work for tt(vicmd), as
+switching from vi insert to command mode becomes impossible.

 The following operations require a keymap to be selected:
