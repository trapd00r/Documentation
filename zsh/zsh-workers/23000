There's no hidden piece of magic in states beyond what's documented, no.
Potentially they allow more complicated logic inline:

  _arguments 'blah:blah:->blahstate' && return 0

  blah blah blah any old stuff

  case $state in
    (blahstate)
    blah blah && return 0  # could run _blah here, of course
    ;;
  esac

  blah blah some other stuff

If you'd used a function then you'd have had to bury the extra logic
in the function or at the end of the _arguments line (_alternative or
whatever).  If your particular case doesn't have any of these complications
then a function is probably neater.
