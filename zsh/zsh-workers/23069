I don't think there should be a problem with signal ordering.  It's not
affected by the changes to traps --- none of the code I touched affects
last_signal, except, obviously, the fact that we may now handle some
signals earlier; but we had to be prepared to handle signals at that
point anyway.

Yes, if TRAPS_ASYNC is set (or we're at the wait builtin) we'd have
handled the trap already.  The difference is only if we'd otherwise have
been delaying signal delivery.
