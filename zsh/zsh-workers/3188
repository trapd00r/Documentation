I have put zsh-3.0.3 and zsh-3.1.2 to ftp://ftp.cs.elte.hu/pub/zsh/ (also
available on http://www.cs.elte.hu/pub/zsh/).  I'll write a real
announcement to zsh-announce later.

The release was ready yesterday but the network to Hungary was very bad and
I was unable to put it to the ftp site.  Europeans can enjoy the speed of
the new 10Mbit TEN-34 line to Hungary but the US connection is still not
the best.  Fortunately the Hungary -> US line is much better than the US ->
Hungary direction, and some of this traffic even goes through the TEN-34
line (for example the traffic to ibm.net) so downloading should be much
easier than uploading.

Here is the list of the new files (times are in EDT):

   86745 Jun  3 02:11 zsh-3.0.3.diff.gz
  651137 Jun  3 02:26 zsh-3.0.3.tar.gz
  240125 Jun  3 02:12 zsh-3.1.2.diff.sh.gz
  846103 Jun  3 02:34 zsh-3.1.2.tar.gz
 1626429 Jun  3 02:39 zsh-RCS.tar.gz

zsh-3.1.2.diff.sh.gz is a shell script, if you have a clean zsh-3.1.1
source tree, just run gzip -dc zsh-3.1.2.diff.sh.gz | sh.
