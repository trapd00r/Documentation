Doh,

You're right. I've got a friend aliasing vi to v. I should've thought
of it. All the aliases I use indeed are just innocuous prefixes to
standard commands, or options I like for the commands to save me some
typing. Could you explain, how to change run-help behavior?

As a side note, I used to like and use compctl in the old days of 3.x.
Now the powerful-completion-engine NT seems to be the thing. I had an
alias which let me use

% stop apache

this would run /usr/local/etc/rc.d/apache.sh stop, *and* complete
apache grokking the whole path (two paths actually, /etc/rc.d and the
above).

Can I get the completion part easily now?

Thanks for your swift response, /S
