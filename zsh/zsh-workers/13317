Hi,

I am running zsh-3.1.9 under Linux (Mandrake 7.2)
on an i686 and I would like to put a control
sequence for xterm, namely, "ESC ]2; <something> BELL"
in the propmpt, in order to write <something>
to the title bar of the window. Unfortunately,
it makes troubles with the line editor
(I am in emacs mode).

Could you, please, inform me in the case someone
fixes the bug for a future release ?

Best regards,
			Teodor
