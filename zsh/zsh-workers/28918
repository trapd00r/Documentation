Without 'branch'?

With the 'branch' there, both:

(i) git branch -d -r <tab>
and
(ii) git branch -r -d <tab>

seem to behave identically whether or not this patch is applied.  With 
or without the patch (i) seems fine AFAICT.  But (ii) doesn't seem to 
complete branches, even though I think it should.
