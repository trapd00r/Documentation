The patch in 5971 added a variable `listshown' that should be always
correctly reflect if a list is shown below the prompt. The patch below 
makes the cursor be moved below the prompt (in the first column) and
give out the CLEAREOD there. Since this is only done if there is a
list, this should work without moving up the screen just because the
prompt happens to be in the last line.

Should have thought about that immediatly...
