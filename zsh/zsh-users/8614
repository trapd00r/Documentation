Yeah, when I have a moment, I will write how I apply this command line
"mailcap" to most things I do.  For example entering a pdf file on one machine will
launch a pdf viewer while doing the same thing on my remote server will
submit that pdf to hylafax (which sends it to the fax numbers  in the 
header section of the pdf).

}   posting a few minutes ago.

}   Just get rid of the $ sign -- it's not necessary in math context unless
}   you're referring to something like the length of a string with $#scalar
}   or the number of arguments $# or a positional parameter like $3.
}   
}   	'(15/GBP)+(3750/1900)'

Huh?  the GBP is a var, how can a bare string be interpolated.
[eric@pepper ~] $ "(15/GBP)+(3750/1900)"
"GBP" is undefined
