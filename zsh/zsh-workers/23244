Hiya,

some weird behavior, I suspect something wrong here.

It all started with zsh taking 100% for some time (time being
big) when doing

$ < ~/loc<TAB> some command

That is invoking completion on a file after an input redirection
added as an afterthought at the beggining of a command line.

Now, some things easier to reproduce:

$ mkdir 1
$ cd 1
$ touch foo bar
$ zsh -f
sc% < b<TAB> foo

(That is type "< b foo" move the cursor back to 4rd character,
then type <Tab>)

Then zsh completes that to:

sc% < foo foo

(instead of expected < bar foo).

(don't know if that's related to the 100% CPU case).

With either of 4.3.2-dev-1+20070322-1 or 4.3.2-25 debian
packages.
