Hm. Interestingly enough, when I put the function into
/usr/share/zsh/site-functions/ then it does not get used. When I put it
into /usr/share/zsh/4.2.1/functions, then it becomes available.

When I do echo $FPATH both of the directories are present there. Why
completion system doesn't see the file in site-functions?
