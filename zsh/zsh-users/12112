Run "compdump" with "set -x" in effect (you'll probably have to add it
to the first "setopt" in the file) and see why it's not running the
"compdump" around line 493, or if it is why that's not doing anything.

You should be able to force a dump with "compinit -d", which takes an
option file argument to use for dumping.
