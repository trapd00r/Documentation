Sure, but a rationale would indeed have helped here.

OK, I'll look into that.  <ESC> shouldn't be a prefix in vi insert
mode, but it is in vi command mode; the switching between modes in that
sequence of keys is probably responsible.

Do not do that.  The cursor keys should *not* be bound in vi insert
mode, only in emacs mode and vi command mode.  We should fix the bug
that causes SEGV, not provide a broken workaround.

In emacs mode the meta binding table is by default used to generate a
set of <ESC>x bindings.

The behaviour hasn't changed.
