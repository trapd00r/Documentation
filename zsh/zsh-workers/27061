Hi,

In our ant build we do some import of some build.xml file which are  
relative to the ANT_HOME:
<import file="${ant.home}/../common-build.xml"/>

So first the completion blows off as sed is not able to find the  
imported file. See when I write "ant <tab>" :
$ ant find_targets:1: no such file or directory: ${ant.home}/../common- 
build.xml
sed: ${ant.home}/../common-build.xml: No such file or directory
find_targets:1: no such file or directory: ${ant.home}/../common- 
build.xml
sed: ${ant.home}/../common-build.xml: No such file or directory

So I have fixed it with a little test. And then I made the completion  
understand the ant.home property reference.

I think at least the check of the existence of the file should be done  
so the completion doesn't break.
For the ant.home, I know I have a particular use case, but I don't  
think it will harm the completion script to have that feature.

Here is the patch:
