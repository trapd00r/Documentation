I do have a spam filter - SpamAssassin put the "{SPAM?}" into the 
subject of the original message for me.

SpamAssassin scored the message at 23.5, almost 5 times the score of 5 
it needs to flag the message as spam.

X-Spamcheck: SpamAssassin (score=23.5, required 5, AS_SEEN_ON, 
BULK_EMAIL, CASHCASHCASH, COPY_ACCURATELY, DATE_IN_PAST_12_24, 
FINANCIAL, FREE_MONEY, INITIAL_INVEST, JODY, LINES_OF_YELLING, 
LINES_OF_YELLING_2, LINES_OF_YELLING_3, MLM, NOT_INTENDED, 
NO_REAL_NAME, ONLY_COST, OPT_IN, PARA_A_2_C_OF_1618, READ_TO_END, 
RISK_FREE, SECTION_301, SENT_IN_COMPLIANCE, SPAM_PHRASE_21_34, 
SUPERLONG_LINE, USER_AGENT_OE)

So I couldn't help wondering why sunsite.dk's spam filter thought the 
message was OK...

Sorry for the noise...

Cheers,


Duncan.
