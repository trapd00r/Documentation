    Hi Bart :)

    OK. I thought, for the userfriendly guide, that there was some
kind of standard tags.

    I supposed: such a good line editor is a good candidate ;)))

    What a pity :((( Zle is far better than any other line editor
I've seen. Much better than readline, no doubt, and more powerful
than libedit.

    Thanks for your answers :))
