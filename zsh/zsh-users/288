Are fc -W, fc -A and the -AI and -WI variants broken in zsh? Using the
command seems straightforward enough, yet I get no history file written when
the commands are issued.I can import a file into history with no problem, just
can't write one, which makes having persistent history difficult.

Can somebody explain to me the proper use of these commands? TIA
