Thank you!

There are two typos:

configure.ac, line 2323
   if test x$zsh_cv_c_broken_wcwdith = xyes; then
should be
   if test x$zsh_cv_c_broken_wcwidth = xyes; then

zsh.h, line 2260
#define WCWIDTH(wc)     wcwidth_mk(wc)
should be
#define WCWIDTH(wc)     mk_wcwidth(wc)

Now combining character support works on MacOS X!
