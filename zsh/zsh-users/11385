As Stephane points out, -r is preferable, as it disables
backslash-escaping. IFS= should not be necessary--and isn't, in zsh--but
dash, bash and ksh all violate POSIX (as I read it) by inserting new
field separators after splitting, instead of using the original
separation; so using IFS= is portable.
