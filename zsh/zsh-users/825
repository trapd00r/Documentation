I have defined

ZDOTDIR=~/.zsh

and put my PATH statement in ~/.zsh/.zshenv so that even when working in
an editor the shell knows my PATH. And 'echo $PATH' from the vi command
line gives the correct value.

Then I have erased the PATH from ~/.zsh/.zshrc thinking that it is now
redundant because ~/.zsh/.zshenv is read on any invocation of the shell.
But when working at the normal shell prompt 'echo $PATH' does not give a
correct value...???

Am I missing something?

TIA
