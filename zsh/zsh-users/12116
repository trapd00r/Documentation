Generally I don't like the idea of trying to work round gross system errors
like something appearing not writeable when it is, but if there's an
equivalent test that works everywhere we can use that instead.

I agree.  Presumably this problem will be fixed at some point at the o/s
level, and, even if that doesn't happen, the library level is the logical
place to compensate.
