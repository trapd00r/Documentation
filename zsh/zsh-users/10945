Subject: persistant Directory history?
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1; format=flowed
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Content-Disposition: inline

Is it possible to have some kind of directory history, taht would last
after closing the shell? As attempted here:
http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20050806202859392 - thsi
doesn't seem to work as zlogout is not executed when an interactive
shell is closed(i think)

Also some other shell seems to have this feature
from http://www.softpanorama.org/Articles/slightly_skeptical_view_on_shell.shtml
>There are also the savedirs and dirsfile shell variables that can be
set >to store the directory stack automatically on logout and restore
it on >login. The dirstack shell variable can be examined to see the
directory >stack and set to put arbitrary directories into the
directory stack.

Basically I want to save the directory stack automatically and have
ctrl+r like history..
Possible?
