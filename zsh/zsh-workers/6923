This once was intentional, when menu-select was intended as a
menu-completion add-on. Now that it is more of a replacement we should 
probably change this. Since I don't use it that much, I'll have to
ask: do all of you agree that it should be changed?
If we change it we should probably give another widget a special
meaning in menu-select so that we have one for the current behaviour
and one for `leave menu-selection and accept the current match'. With
that users could do a `bindkey -M menuselect ...' to get their
prefered behavior. So: any suggestions for which widget we should use?
(Remember that one couldn't use this widget to leave menu-select,
then.) And what should be the default?

Hm. Never seen this, so I can't help here (we don't have AIXes here).
