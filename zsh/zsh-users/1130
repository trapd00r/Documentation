I have put a reasonably up to date set of help files on the web
at http://www.ifh.de/~pws/help.tar.gz (there's no link to it,
you must use that URL).  This is just temporary.  A function like
the one below is necessary for full functionality.

I have a newer version of helpfiles, which I'll post separately
to zsh-workers since it's not useful here.

# start run-help
typeset zhelp=~/src/zsh-3.1.2/Help   # CHANGE THIS
typeset page="${PAGER:-less}"	     # Hack to split words in $page
				     # maybe change less to more
case $1 in
   .) 1=dot;;
   :) 1=colon;;
   -) 1=dash;;
esac
if [[ $1 = compctl ]]; then
    man compctl
elif [[  -f $zhelp/$1 ]]
then
     ${=page} $zhelp/$1
else
  man $1
fi
# end run-help
