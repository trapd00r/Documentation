LOL pretty stupid of me to overlook that. I could have looked at the
FreeBSD man pages long ago! Oh well.

No worries, I have machines running OpenBSD (but not {Free,Net}BSD).

Interesting. Though _bsd_pkg was made for FreeBSD originally, I wonder

Okay, I introduced a switch statement for filename extensions because it
seemed to be more involved than simply t[gbz]. I should probably dig up
