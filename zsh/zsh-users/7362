At this point things are a little messed up.  Note that there isn't any
matching file that actually has three hyphens; those are standing in for
"-.-" in the first match and "_--" in the second match.  Also, the right
completion would be "linux-2.4.2--s-r3", so I'm not sure how the final
hyphen and the "s" are becoming transposed.

That doesn't match where you said the cursor was.  Did you move the
cursor to the right before pressing TAB, or should that have said

    root@wolfbrand# cd linux-2.4.2-<TAB>--sr3

??

If I understand correctly, you were expecting this to take you into menu
completion cycling between the two previous matches.  I confess I don't
know why it does not, except that it may be related to the transposed "s".

} These are my completion settings: [1] and [2].

It'd be a little easier to work with these if they didn't have the ascii
art border.  As it is it's not possible to cut'n'paste them into a shell
to duplicate your setup.

I do notice that you're not using the _oldlist completer.  You might try
adding that to the front of your list of completers and see if it helps.
