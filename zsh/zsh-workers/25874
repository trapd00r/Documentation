This works fine for me (as does the version with "()" after the previous
fix).  Does the same still happen after "zsh -f; autoload -U compinit;
compinit"?  Is the character the composed version, i.e. Unicode 0x0104,
which is 0xc4 0x84 in UTF-8, or could it be some decomposed version with
combining characters?

Please send the output from running "^X?" if there no obvious difference.
