I think it's a good plan during this time when autoconf 2.50 is fresh,
but I don't think effort should be expended to maintain compatibility
with 2.13 in future.  After all, it's neither impossible nor difficult
for zsh developers to have multiple versions of autoconf on hand, should
they be required.
