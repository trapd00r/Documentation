Is this a bug?
% uname -s -r -v -m -p -i -o
Linux 2.4.21-32.0.1.ELsmp #1 SMP Tue May 17 17:52:23 EDT 2005 i686 i686 i386 GNU/Linux
% echo $ZSH_VERSION > /dev/null | cat # should print nothing, but...
4.3.2

The problem becomes an issue when you have a command that generates
something on both stdout and stderr, and you want to dump the stdout
and page through the stderr:

% foo 2>&1 > /dev/null | more

I'm hoping someone says this can be addressed by setting an
option.  :-)  I was also able to duplicate it on hpux:
% uname -s -r -v -m -i -l
HP-UX B.11.11 U 9000/800 139414660 unlimited-user license
