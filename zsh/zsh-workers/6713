Does SunOS return solaris in $OSTYPE then - that's suprising. HP/UX also
uses a ':' so should be added to the pattern. I don't have access to it any
more so can't tell you what it gives in $OSTYPE. I'd suggest using an if
then else instead of the case statement as I've never seen a chown using
anything other than . or :.
