Seems like it's not needed. zsh comes with tons of functions
predefined for the new completion system ;)

Have you tried to put
   autoload -U compinit
   compinit
in your .zshrc and then type something like
   ssh tk<TAB>u<TAB>
and see how it is expanded to something like
   ssh tkoehler@unser.linux.laeuft.auf.s390.org
or something?

There's quite a lot of stuff there in zsh-4.0.x :-)

Ciao,
Thomas
