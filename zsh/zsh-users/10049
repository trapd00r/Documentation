Hi,

 from the manpage II read that adding (#i) makes a pattern case
 insensitive. Now I am confused what "pattern" includes.

 Is "*" a pattern and "b*" is not ?

 Giving

		ls -ld *(#i)

 prints all upper- and lowercase matches.

		ls -ld b*(#i)

 prints all matches beginning with "b" but those beginning with "B".

		ls -ld *b*(#i)

 prints all upper- and lower-case patterns including "b" but not "B".

 
 

 Game over player one. Insert help to play again...  :O)


 Keep zshing!
