ftp://ftp.zsh.org/development/zsh-4.3.4-dev-3.tar.gz

Various problems turned up.

- Rework curses headers
- Attempt to fix warnings on Tru64 (unverified)
- Memory management with environment strings
- Fix for prompt lengths
- zshcalsys.1 manual was missing
- Memory management of termcap strings

Still haven't updated NEWS etc., sorry.
