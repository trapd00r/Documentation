Hello,

Recent zsh snapshots from cvs (i.e. 4.3.2-20060729 and 4.3.2-20060817)
have the following problem:

compaudit:50: bad substitution
compinit:469: bad pattern: _i_test[=3Dyes
colors:39: bad substitution
at@localhost ~ $=20

The error messages are issued at zsh startup.  4.3.2-20060619 snapshot
did not have such a problem.
