} Can I have a warning that the function wasn't already loaded?

We're venturing into the realm of "you should be able to do this yourself."

E.g., just take out the 2>/dev/null

Or:

reload() {
while (( $# )); do
  unfunction $1 2>/dev/null || print -u2 "$1 loading for the first time"
  autoload $1
  shift
done

Or whatever ...
