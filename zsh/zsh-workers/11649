If one has already loaded the complist module before running compinit, then
one can use `#compdef -k menu-select ...' at the top of completion functions.

If one has not already loaded complist, then compdef chokes.

At other places in the completion system we automatically load complist when
it seems wanted.  Perhaps compdef should too?
