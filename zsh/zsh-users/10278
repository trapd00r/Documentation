I came up with this elegant approach thanks to Dan Nelson
from the FreeBSD mailinglist:

if [[ $USER == root ]] ; then

         a1="%{$fg_bold[cyan]%}"
         a2="%{$fg_no_bold[cyan]%}"
         a3="%{$fg_bold[black]%}"

else

         a1="%{$fg_bold[red]%}"
         a2="%{$fg_no_bold[red]%}"
         a3="%{$fg_bold[black]%}"

fi

PROMPT="$a1($a2%n$a3@$a2%m$a1)($a2%D{%H:%M}$a3+$a2%D{%d/%m}$a1)"$'\n'
PROMPT+="$a1($a2%#$a3:$a2%~$a1) %{$reset_color%}"

Nice isn't it?

All the best,
Kyrre
