Unfortunately, no, CVS doesn't work like that.

If all you do is retag the trunk revision with an ordinary (non-branch)
tag, then checkouts of exactly that tag will pick up exactly that rev of
the file, but checkouts/updates of the branch tag will still get the
previous one.

You could manually delete and recreate the magic "branch tag", but that's
rather dangerous.
