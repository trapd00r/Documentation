Great idea.  If this can be implemented cleanly, it's in.  Let's be the
first shell with approximate pattern matching (and approximate globbing)
as a standard feature.

Maybe.  The autocorrection could be implemented as a shell function,
which by default uses fuzzy globbing to generate corrections.  Is this
what you have in mind?
