} This simple patch (only the trivial function recursiveedit is new, the

} zlemain to a new function zlecore) has a lot of mileage.

Cool.  Now if there were some way to get the various "minibuffer" commands
like execute-named-command to use recursive editing with a separate keymap,
we could really do some interesting stuff.

Who'll be the first to rewrite the zsh tetris game with recursive-edit?
