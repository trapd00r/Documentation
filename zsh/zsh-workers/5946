No, you get the incorrect output in other shells.  This is the famous
SHWORDSPLIT issue mentioned in the FAQ (which says that all other
shells are broken).

If you use

        % a=(echo x)

instead, then things will work as you want.  Or setopt SHWORDSPLIT, or
use whatever magic it is to do SHWORDSPLIT on expansion (the $a line).
