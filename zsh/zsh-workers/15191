Subject: PATCH: Very serious bug: Bad pattern in precmd()
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Try this only in a debugger or if you have another shell from which you
can kill the first one:

zsh% precmd() { echo [[ }

Zsh goes into an infinite loop printing `precmd: bad pattern: [['.  This
does not happen in 3.0.8, but does happen in 3.1.9 (which is the oldest
3.1.x binary I have around).

This appears to have resulted from moving hbegin() to above preprompt()
in loop() -- hbegin() has the side-effect of resetting `errflag = 0'.
This was my fault, all the way back in article 10168, so it's been around
since 3.1.6-dev-20 without anyone catching it.
