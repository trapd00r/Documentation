Subject: Compile problem
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

I get the following problem when trying to compile on my Suse 6.1 PC (gcc = egcs 2.91.66).

gcc -c -I.  -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -DMODULE -O2 -m486 -I/usr/local/include -fpic -o compresult..o compresult.c
compresult.c: In function `calclist':
compresult.c:1169: size of array `mlens' is too large
make[3]: *** [compresult..o] Error 1

I was able to compile it by using #undef HAVE_VARIABLE_LENGTH_ARRAYS in config.h.
