It may not be necessary in this case, but generally there wouldn't
be a problem with using multiple associative arrays to hold multiple
data items.

I think this kind of information should be available via special

form and so on when doing this kind of thing.  And of course using
parameters means we don't have to worry about quoting special characters.
