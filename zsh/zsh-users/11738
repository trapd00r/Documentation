Also for some reason I don't know, several of fREW's responses got 
spamblocked by my external 3rd party spam filter service mxlogic. The 
messages looked ok to me and devoid of things that ususally look like spam, 
possibly the gmail from address? but that would be ridiculous to be blocking 
all of gmail, plus many of his messages do come through fine. I probably 
missed several messages before I noticed one recently by chance.

As far as the default reply... well I think I'm gonna have to side with the 
list admin's choice on that. It _is_ slightly inconvenient for me too, but, 
people are ignorant and if the default reply was to the list, then the list 
would get slammed with idiotic huge messages full of attachments and 
graphics etc.. Thats really a gross problem for the machine actually hosting 
the list and doesn't help all the other mail servers delivering the messages 
either. I'm on other lists, perfectly techy just like this, where you'd 
think the population would all be clueful and respectful and understanding.. 
.wrong. there are several guys on them who just refuse to accept what 
everyone screams at them about their huge html letterhead/template plus 3 
large image attachements in their signature as part of every message, and 
then on top of that they post _huge_ screen shot images to relay about one 
sentence of error message they saw on a screen. _A TEXT SCREEN_ by the way, 
totally cut & pasteable terminal emulator! Multiply that times the number of 
list recipients.. Even if someone can't understand, hey, some things just 
plain not everyone gets, you'd think he would at least just do what everyone 
asks simply because they (everyone, overwhelming majority of users plus 
owner and helper admin) ask, especially since they are all giving him free 
help (the help only goes one way in this case, he (both proverbial and 
specific) never has help to offer).
So, the default reply-to helps a _little_ with that. You have to go out of 
your way to reply to the list, but it also means you have to go out of your 
way to abuse the list. I don't now how much it helps and if it's really 
beneficial enough to be worth everyones inconvenience, but at least I 
understand why it is and can't really argue with it.
