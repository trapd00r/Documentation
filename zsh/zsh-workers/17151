Yes, you could use `read -t' to read from it.  But unless someone else
has been tinkering with the fd before the handler get's to look at it,
the result of the select assures you that the first read won't block.

There's some rudimentary support for recovery: if there's an error in
a handler (e.g. ^C), the error flag is unset and the select is tried
again with all the handlers removed (it could simply drop through to the
read).  It could be altered so that this actually uninstalled the
handler in question.
