} This one just beeps at me?!?

Is it possible that expand-args-of is not being autoloaded?

It's compinit that processes the #autoload directive, so you either have
to manually autoload it or re-run compinit or start a fresh zsh before it
will work.  I should have mentioned that.  You may also have to remove
your ~/.zcompdump file and let it be rebuilt.
