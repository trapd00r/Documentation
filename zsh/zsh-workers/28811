Within looking in any detail, I think it's going to have to be an error.
The reason you need to unset variables to retie them is that undoing it
is a lot of tricky code all over the place creating messy special cases.
The real fix is the same real fix as to most typeset problems: the code
should delegate much more to functions for different types of variables
reached via a uniform interface.
