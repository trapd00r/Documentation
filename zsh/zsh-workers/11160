I'm quite happy to remove it which is easy.  Currently there's no simple
replacement in the case of _configure, however, because (#s) doesn't get
tokenized (the `#' didn't need to be, it was always recognised, hence the
need for quoting).  This would require the -s option to _arguments to do
some kind of globsubst thing, which may or may not be desirable.  I haven't
looked for any other uses of this feature.
