It also appears that zsh by default does not conmplete path elements in

export PATH=3D/path/one:/pa<TAB> ... -- nothing

are colons covered by magicequalsubst ?  Even with compinit, my zsh
4.0.2 does not complete after =3D or :...   How do I tell zsh to
tokenize on =3D and :, and possibly something else?
