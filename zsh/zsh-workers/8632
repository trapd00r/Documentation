Subject: PATCH: oops, a set -x


I forgot to remove a `set -x' in `_telnet'.

That's because I wanted to find out why Tanaka (I think it was him)
wrote:

  # _arguments cannot handle following three options.
  optionmap=( "[-noasynch]" '-noasynch' \
              "[-noasyncnet]" '-noasyncnet' \
              "[-noasynctty]" '-noasynctty' )

and the proceeds to do the option handling by hand...

Tanaka: have you mentioned that at the time you wrote it and I missed
it? I tried and since `_telnet' doesn't support options for my
`telnet' at all, I couldn't find out what goes wrong with these
options. Could you explain that to me so that we can fix it and
simplify `_telnet'?


Bye
 Sven
