Most vexing of all is that my post last week about going to a subscribers
only posting mode seems to have exposed my email address in some public
archive.  From there it was harvested by spammers who are now using it to
spam other lists, leaving me to deal with all of the bounces and other
flotsam.  I'm not 100% certain that my post to zsh-users was at fault, but
the date of my post and the start of the influx are closely aligned.

If you succeed in unsubbing, I'll mail you when this gets sorted out, if you
like...
