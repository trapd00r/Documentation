I use smart-insert-last-word with a match directive:

autoload -U smart-insert-last-word
zle -N insert-last-word smart-insert-last-word
zstyle :insert-last-word match '[^,]??*'

Since I want words that are at least 3 letters long and don't begin with a
comma (all my global aliases use a leading comma, such as ",l" for "| less",
",f" for "| fgrep", etc.).  Since anything really short is not really worth
using insert-last-word for anyway, this tends to do what I expect.  Note
that if no qualifying words are found on a line, smart-insert-last-word just
returns the last word, so don't let that fool you into thinking there is a
bug when there is not.
