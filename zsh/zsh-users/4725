Subject: unlimit filesize (how?)

Hi all,

I would like to use zsh as 'root' user on my Linux box (2.4.18 kernel),
as well.
Unfortunately I cannot set the limit for filesize to
an unlimited value although I have configure zsh
for big filesize support.
Doing just an 'fdisk' and trying to write the partition table
back (on a 40 Gb disk) fails. Switching to 'bash' works fine.
Trying to set the filesize limit to 'unlimited' or a large
value gives an error message saying it's not possible to
use such a big value.

Thanks for a hint,
