:This sounds OK, since I don't think many people are using ansi2knr any
:more, but is there anything wrong with copying it into the C file?

Updated suggestion:
Make subdirectory "GPL" (or something"/GPL") on FTP site.
Put in GPL/COPYING
       GPL/ansi2knr.c
       GPL/texi2html.tar.gz
       GPL/yodl-1.31.18.tar.gz
Put LICENCE (zsh licence) into main FTP directory.
Remove ansi2knr.c from main distribution
Make "configure --enable-ansi2knr" bomb out if it can't find ansi2knr

This way we're only distributing stuff in our main bundle under the
Zsh LICENCE and if people want other stuff under a different licence
we provide pointers for them (i.e. see main FTP site).
