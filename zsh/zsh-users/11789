When the "unset" option is off, causing zsh to prompt whenever an unknown
parameter would be expanded, trying to trigger these functions causes an
error message stating that "__searching" is unset.  Which it is.

Adding "emulate -L zsh; setopt unset" to the top of these two functions
resolves the issue.
