This makes 2.5.0 sound quite unusable, which it wasn't.  Are you also
counting the bugs introduced after 2.5.0?

Considering the amount of system calls a shell uses, it is surely very
portable.  But I tend to doubt whether this is true when compared to
all kinds of programs that do not need to depend on system specific
features.

This sounded too good to be true, so I just tested this on the perl
Configure script and it failed, sorry.  (To be slightly more precise:
when typing '& -d' at a prompt to make it use the defaults zsh gives
me a parse error, while /bin/sh (POSIX, not traditional Bourne) has no
problems.  This on HPUX 10.10.)
