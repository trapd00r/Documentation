my system just upgraded from zsh 3.0.5 to zsh 3.1.2 and i'm wondering if
there is any way to turn off the new 'feature' that completion lists are
printed below the current prompt rather than redisplaying the prompt again
after a list. it's not listed anywhere in the docs and it drives me nuts :)

thanks in advance,
