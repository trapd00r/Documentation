As Mikael said, the new completion system will handle this: either
"autoload -U compinit; compinit" in .zshrc or do "autoload -U
compinstall; compinstall" just the once to help you set it up.

Note, however, that PATH is tied to the array path and

path=($path /usr/local/b<TAB>)

is equivalent to the above assuming, which is highly likely to be the
case, that PATH is already marked for export.
