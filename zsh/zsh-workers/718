The patch below makes a slight `improvement' to the CSH_JUNKIE_QUOTES
option.  In order to emulate csh more accurately, this patch makes the
option prevent \ from quoting anything except a newline inside double
quotes.  This makes zsh emulate csh behaviour fully w.r.t. single and
double quotes.  Behaviour in backquoted expressions is still different,
but I suspect that that would be just too awkward to emulate fully.
This change is very simple.
