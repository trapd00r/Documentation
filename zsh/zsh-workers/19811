} I don't think this ever got added... It might be as simple as the
} following, which seems to work.

I worry that there's a race condition between setting sigtrapped[signum]
and actually adding the function node.  And what happens if the fucntion
fails to load?  Does sigtrapped[signum] get cleared somewhere else?

Otherwise it looks like the right idea.
