} Are you sure, it is a problem of missing empty line?

Yes.

} Look, what is generated:
} 
} CYGWIN=
} test "$ac_cv_cygwin" = yes && CYGWIN=yes                   echo $ac_n
} "checking for mingw32 environment""... $ac_c" 1>&6
} 
} that is, CYGWIN is set in environment of `echo' command and lost after this.

Right.

} This expansion is part of AC_CYGWIN and has nothing to do with AC_EXEEXT.

Wrong.  In /usr/lib/autoconf/acspecific.m4 we have:

AC_DEFUN(AC_EXEEXT,
[AC_REQUIRE([AC_CYGWIN])
AC_REQUIRE([AC_MINGW32])
AC_MSG_CHECKING([for executable suffix])
....

The `test "$ac_cv_cygwin" = yes && CYGWIN=yes' comes from AC_CYGWIN and
the `echo $ac_n "checking for mingw32 environment""... $ac_c" 1>&6' is
from AC_MINGW32.  The problem is that if you *explicitly* use AC_CYGWIN,
then the first AC_REQUIRE in AC_EXEEXT doesn't expand and the beginning
of AC_MINGW32 gets pasted onto the end of the explicit AC_CYGWIN output.

So maybe the bug you're thinking of is that AC_EXEEXT gets it wrong if
you *don't* explicitly use AC_CYGWIN followed by a blank line; I didn't
try that, but I *did* check the output the way I committed the patch.
