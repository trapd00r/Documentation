I'd like to make the whole description more table-ish anyway. In the
descriptions of the styles things like `depends on', `see also'
together with plain lists of other styles (or styles and special
values for them) and in the description for functions tables of used
styles would be nice to have.

And examples, as you said... I just don't know which examples would be
good -- I mean we have people here who know better what would be
helpful because they needed some time to find it out.


While we are talking about styles anyway, I'd like to take the
opportunity to ask again: Peter, why does `remote_glob' use an
underscore instead of a `-'? Only historical reasons? Do you like that 
better? Does everyone except me like it better?

Bye
 Sven
