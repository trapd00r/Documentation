Well, er , nice approach (;-

Although its elegance is undeniable, it still doesn't tell me if one of 
the numerous potential other startup files got read ( zprofile, .zshenv, 
etc ) .  Of course , I can check
manually if they are there , but this is still errorprone because it is 
easy to forget one.
