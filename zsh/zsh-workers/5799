It isn't irrelevant, both normal and new style completion still show
this bug (which is actually caused by the code for expand-or-complete
before the completion code gets to it).

But I still don't know how to find out if it is the right way to do
it. I once had it in one of my versions (of course) and didn't see any 
unexpected behavior but that is certainly far from a complete test.
