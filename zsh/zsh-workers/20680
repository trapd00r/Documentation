    Hi Peter :)

    AFAIK, mbrtowc returns -1 for invalid and -2 for incomplete (and
a 0 for the NULL widechar). Although the return value is 'size_t' is
nearly impossible for the function to return (size_t) -1 (or -2) for
a *correct* conversion in UTF-8. I think there is a safe bet to
assume that even an ill-formed operating system not honoring C99 will
have SIZE_MAX greater than 8 XDDDDD

    I haven't used myself the restartable set of multibyte functions,
so please take a look at SUS, POSIX or whatever to see the gory
details for this function. I've used SUS for reference.
