This is almost certainly what's going on in your case, Jean.  On my
FreeBSD host, the default configuration for user ID's with no HOME
directory is to have the string "/nonexistent" in the "home_dir" field
of /etc/passwd.  For no login shell, the string "/nonexistent" goes into
the "shell" field.  To wit:

  % grep /nonexistent /etcpasswd
  ftp:*:14:5:Anonymous FTP Admin:/home/services/ftp:/nonexistent
  pop:*:68:6:Post Office Owner:/nonexistent:/sbin/nologin
  nobody:*:65534:65534:Unprivileged user:/nonexistent:/sbin/nologin

I wouldn't be surprised if the "www" user also has a "/nonexistent" HOME
in the default FreeBSD setup (I had manually changed my "www" user ages
ago).
