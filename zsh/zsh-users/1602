Does anyone have a nice and small function to sum up the sizes of files?
I know it can be done with awk, sed, and perl - but I just want to use
zsh and its arithmetic.  Is it possible?  And yet fast?

I think I must have asked this before, but - I can't find info on it.
I just hope this isn't a standard example in the zsh manuals - yet.
but I think it should be.  ;-)

Sven
