>Is there any real difference in the function of .zprofile, .zshrc, etc?  

Yes.  .zprofile and .zlogin are used only by login shells, .zshenv is
sourced by all shells, and .zshrc is used only by interactive shells.
Roughly speaking, .zshenv should set up aliases, environment variables
and emulation-relevant options; .zshrc should do compctls and other
options; and .z(profile|login) should do tty settings, motd display and
so on.
