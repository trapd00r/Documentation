The BUGS file says that there are problems on ULTRIX with gcc.  The problem is
really in nawk.  As I remember, the latest BUGS file did not contain this.

The patch below also removes the multi-io bug/feature description since Zefram
fixed it by addin NO_MULTI_IOS option (which is not yet part of the baseline).

The MACHINES file contains the note about SunOS 4.1.3 (which is referenced
from the BUGS file).

Cheers,

   Zoltan
