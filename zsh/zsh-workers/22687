right

This is a feature.  The parameters are different interfaces to the same
information.  "typeset -r write" will work as expected.  This is inevitable
given the current model for internal parameter storage.  I'm not
particularly attached to the current system anyway; parameters are probably
the clunkiest remaining parts of the system, full of ad-hoc tests,
over-complicated but under-powerful interfaces, and accesses into the
system at all sorts of different levels that ought to be implementation
details.
