It will, although the other order would be a good deal more logical so
I'll change it anyway.  Since it's anchored to the start and end
[[:space:]] will only match a single whitespace character.  Since the
test words never have quotes stripped, that can only come from real
whitespace between words.

On rereading I didn't make it clear that the test at this level is
always on shell words; anything else gets confusingly recursive.
