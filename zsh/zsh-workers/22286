If you run nscd, applications will ask it over a unix socket using a
standard protocol, nscd will dlopen the required libs, do the lookups,
and return the result.  It also caches results so access to slow
providers like ldaps becomes tolerable.  It's basically required when
using newish versions of Oracle since it includes its own ldap
libraries which conflict with openldap, so if you are using nss_ldap
and not running nscd, you coredump :)
