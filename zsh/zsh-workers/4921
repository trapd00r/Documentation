I wanted to ask if someone could tell me what the purpose of the return
value of the macro try(X) in exec. is? (In the zsh-3.1.5-pws-4 source)

As far as I can tell, the newly allocated string that try(X) returns is
not assigned to anything at the four places in exec.c that it is used ...
so that string never gets freed.


Thanks - 

Dan
