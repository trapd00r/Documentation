Is it possible when defining a shell function as a user defined 
widget to access the prefix argument?

Also, is there any way when calling a builtin widget to figure out
the status?  For example, I'd like to do "zle complete-word" in my
widget and then determine if:

  - it completed something
  - there were no completions
  - choices were listed
  - choices had already been listed and it did nothing

thanks
Greg
