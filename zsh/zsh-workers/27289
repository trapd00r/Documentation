Basically from csh, I think.  Arrays were a bit of an afterthought in
earlier Bourne-style shells, so zsh didn't take much notice.

It's far too late for this.  Encouraging people to use anything other
than native zsh or ksh emulation would be a disaster, multiplying our
problems yet more and solving nothing.
