May I make one request for ZSH patch submitting. It is really nice to
indicate ZSH version, to which patch applies, in subject. Without it one
gets the whole bunch of ZSH patches without any way to select the right(s)
one(s).

One step further would be common patch format. Something, like

ZSH-Version: zsh-3.1.2-zefram4

in body. It would allow automatic sorting and provide patch archive by
version.

(if developers agree on that, probably it shoud be announced on zsh-users
and FAQ as well).

cheers
