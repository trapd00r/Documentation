Probably a good idea.  It should refuse to load the redundant dynamic
module, and refuse to unload the static module.

How?  Would this be a case of #defining all imported symbols to
(*symbol_table[SYMBOL_NUM]) and having the module base manage home-made
symbol tables?  If so, what do we do about systems where there are
several sizes of pointer?

What's wrong with `nm obj.o | grep " U "` and comparing against the
lists of exported symbols?  This could even be used to generate module
dependencies automatically.
