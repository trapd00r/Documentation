S'ok.

} Because a quoting a single quote inserts more single quotes. This
} wasn't even handled correctly (in the case that there was one quoted
} single quote in the string) by get_comp_string().
} 
} The patch below should fix it. At least it does for the pretty
} complicated cases I tried.

} I do not see any difference with this patch. As before, listing
} pathnames with spaces in single quotes correctly adds slash to
} directories and in double quotes adds nothing.

I see slashes getting added to directories in double quotes:

schaefer<505> ls        
a\ b  a\ d/  don't stop/  rmthat/
schaefer<506> ls "a<TAB><TAB>
schaefer<506> ls "a\\
Completing files
a\\ d/  a\\ b 

And then going on:

schaefer<506> ls "a\\ <TAB>
schaefer<506> ls "a\\ d/<TAB>
schaefer<506> ls "a\\ b"

One oddity is that typing the closing quote after `ls "a\\ d/' does not
auto-remove the slash, but I don't think that's strictly a bug.
