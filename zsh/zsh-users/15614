       #compdef names... [ -[pP] patterns... [ -N names... ] ]
              The file will be made autoloadable and the function
defined in it will
              be called when completing names, each of which is either
the name of a
[...]
              If the #compdef line contains one of the options -p or
-P,  the  words
              following  are taken to be patterns.  The function will
be called when
              completion is attempted for a command or context that
matches  one  of
              the  patterns.   The options -p and -P are used to
specify patterns to

You can also do this in your .zshrc instead of in the completer if you
wish, just write
compdef _foo -p 'foo_*'

At least that's what the documentation says, it doesn't seem to work that w=
ell.
