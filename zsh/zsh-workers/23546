That ought to be relatively straighforward, along the lines of
how vared handles it.

What I was referring to was this:

% cat test-i
print Run some code, then type "^d"
. -i /dev/tty
print Finished
% zsh ./test-i

(which is where I assume people are likely to want to embed some
interactive stuff).  Here, there appears to be no zle support at all.  It
works OK if I use a shell function in an interactive shell instead of a
script.

The problem is that a lot of stuff isn't usually set up at all in
non-interactive shells.  Again, vared handles this OK and should serve as a
model.
