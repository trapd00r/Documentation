Yes, it was about then -- it was in the hzoli releases from the start, I think.

I was trying to keep quiet on this one, since I never had a particular axe to
grind, but compatibility with other shells seems sensible.

The idea was that the "old behaviour" remained available with cd +n,
while pushd/popd +n (which used to do the same as cd) moved to bash/csh
semantics.  I didn't anticipate that this could cause any aggravation, but
seemingly it has, for which I apologise. I guess it's because I set
AUTOPUSHD, so there really is no lost functionality.

Would it make people happy if (optionally?) cd +n pushed the current directory?
Then cd +n could be exactly the same as the old pushd +n.

Anthony
