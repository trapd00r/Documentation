zpty -w with timeout is right stuff. I think, we better leave non-blocking
mode in - may be, there are some exotic cases when it may be useful. And in
case of non-bocking read with pattern add return code 'did not match' (it
cannot happen in case of blocking read without either EOF or timeout).

But we need better semantic for zpty -r then. Without pattern, how much
exactly should it read? A character at a time? A line?
