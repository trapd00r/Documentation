I'm trying to figure out some oddities in the behavior of zsh 4.2.0 (i686-p=
c-linux-gnu) running on devian/unstable. In particular, I'm having troubl=
e understanding the order of execution for the startup files. According t=
o the manual, /etc/zsh/zshenv should be executed before anything else dur=
ing all shell invocations. I have placed the lines

echo $PATH
alias

at the top of zshenv, in order to figure out what path and aliases are pres=
ent at the beginning of the invocation process, and they print out

/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/bin/X11:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin
run-help=3Dman
which-command=3Dwhence

So what's setting PATH and making aliases before zshenv runs?
