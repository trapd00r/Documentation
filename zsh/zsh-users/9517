I'm having some trouble with zmv.  
Suppose I have a bunch of python scripts in a directory, and none of them end 
in .py.  I want to give them all a proper extension, so I try:
	zmv -n '(*)(#qe,file ${REPLY}|grep "python script",)' '$1.py'
This works as I expected it to.
However, if I have a bunch of python scripts in several subdirectories of 
varying depths, I try:
	zmv -n '(**/con*)(#qe,file ${REPLY}|grep "python script",)' '$1.py'
which gives me the following error:
	zmv:238: bad pattern: (*/*)(#qe,file ${REPLY}|grep python,)

I've also tried:
	zmv -n '(*/*(#qe,file ${REPLY}|grep python,))' '$1.py'
which doesn't work either.

I'm sure I'm missing something, because it seems like it should be possible.  
Can someone help me with this, please?  I've been trying various permutations 
for over an hour, and I'm REALLY stuck.

-Dan
