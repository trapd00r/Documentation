Back in users/6698, I complained that compaudit was duplicating entries
in $fpath, but I hadn't traced down why.  It turns out it's a typo:

    --- compaudit.orig	Sun Oct 26 17:49:29 2003
    +++ compaudit	Sun Mar 21 11:09:33 2004
    @@ -64,7 +64,7 @@
           # Likewise (installation-layout)

    -    for _i_line in {1..$#i_addfiles}; do
    +    for _i_line in {1..$#_i_addfiles}; do
           _i_file=${_i_addfiles[$_i_line]}
           [[ -d $_i_file && -z ${fpath[(r)$_i_file]} ]] ||
             _i_addfiles[$_i_line]=

Thanks,
