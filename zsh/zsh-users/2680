Yes and thanks for the answer and run_parallel function. In brief
what and how I'd really like to see is e.g.

for i in * PARALLEL N ; do job $i ; done

Would it be very difficult to add these kind of feature? This would
always work when I'll do an

[anyshell] zsh
[zsh :)] 

on any machine and no matter what zsh functions/extensions are
installed/configured.
