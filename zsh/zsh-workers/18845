My guess is your system is using stdout to decide what the tty is, which
is explicitly closed.  Try using 1>&2 on the ps command line.  (Or
something gets closed.  Is it stdin?  Anyway, reopen it.)

This -J/-V business always got me really confused.  The documentation
for _wanted says it takes the same arguments as _requested.  _requested
doesn't say anything about its arguments, but _description, which is
down there underneath, does say how it handles them.  Passing them down
is a bit of a nightmare.

I suspect what we want to do is test for an explicitly set sort style in
_description and used that to override the default.  Then we can all
forget about tweaking the functions.
