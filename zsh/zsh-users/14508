Hello,

I have a snow leopard desktop to which I use the default BASH which  
works fine. Then I have another system on the house that runs Tiger  
(OSX) 10.4.11 mac mini G4 ppc. When I ssh from SL to Tiger I can't  
write greek. The UTF-8 support appears to be broken, while I can't see  
nor UTF-8 nor ISO-8859-7 chars on mutt email client.

Of course I tried to set .zshrc LANG and LOCALE options in el_GR.UTF-8  
mode but it does not work. And while I can't write Greek to zsh and  
bash, apparently I can write correctly using ksh!!!

Does this make any sense? Could someone give me a hint on how to  
adjust this?

Best regards


Panagiotis (atmosx) Atmatzidis
