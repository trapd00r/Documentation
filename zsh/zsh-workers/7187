I encount this problem with the code such as:

region="$buffer[pos1,pos2]"

I represent a region by pos1 and pos2.
To represent null region, I assign pos2 to pos1 - 1.
I think it's natural, but it's not works when pos1 is 1.

So, my preference is "treat [n,0] as null string if 0 < n".

However, it is no ploblem with the code such as:

local tmp=" $buffer"
region="$tmp[pos1 + 1, pos2 + 1]"

But, I think it's ugly.
Is there exists a more smart code?
# For example, is it representable with only variable expansion?
