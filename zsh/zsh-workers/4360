}
} E.g. if one wants to say 
} that a lowercase letter on the command line matches an upeprcase
} letter in the words, one can say: `m:{a-z}={A-Z}'.

What happens if there aren't the same number of characters in each class?

}     compctl -M 'r:|[-.,_/]=* r:|=* m:{a-z}={A-Z}' 'l:|=* r:|=*'

I dunno, Sven; I think if you'd tried you could have made that a little
