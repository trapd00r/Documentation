The difference is, that "aptitude install <tab>" lists uninstalled
packages, whereas "apt-get install <tab>" simply lists all available
packages. The former, while being more appropriate, also takes more
work.

I must admit, that I'm not quite familiar with how compsys' caching is
implemented. I may be giving wrong pointers here. So I should better be
quiet.

The aptitude completion *does* in fact look at "aptitude -h" to figure
out which sub-commands to offer. And my aptitude does include it in its
output. Are you sure that your aptitude supports `build-dep'? Because
its author claims the help message was updated the in the same version
the functionality was added:
    <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=501998#10>

(Although I think I remember an aptitude that had `build-dep' and didn't
list it in -h output. But I'm not sure.)
