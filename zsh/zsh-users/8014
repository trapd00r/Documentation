This seems like an odd question, because any key _combination_ you choose
will be at least as many keystrokes as typing ctrl-o enter.  Normally you
want bindings for things that would otherwise take lots of keystrokes.

However:

accept-most-recent() {
  zle most-recent-file && zle .accept-line
}
zle -N accept-most-recent
bindkey '^X^O' accept-most-recent
