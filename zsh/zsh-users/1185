Well, there's this Linux account I have where there is some system file  
which is setting up some variables after my .zshenv.  Really annoying.  Sun  
and NeXT have never had this problem.

Anyway, the only systemwide I can find is /etc/zprofile, and it isn't in there.

Is there a way I can tell zsh to let me know what files it is sourcing  
during startup?

What else can I do to figure out where these alias definitions are coming from!??!?

Thanks
TjL
