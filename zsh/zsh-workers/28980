Without looking at it again, I think brace expansion is one of the really
big hacks in the completion code, taking arguments apart and putting
them back together again in an ad hoc fashion, so without being
rewritten from the ground up it might be hard to do much.  Having said
that, if anyone was able to understand it it might be easy.
