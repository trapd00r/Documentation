But how do you know how much line prefix to type in order to get a
correct match, and how do you efficiently deal with multiple history
lines with the same long prefix? I find
history-incremental-search-backward to work better since it has neither
of those issues--

cp foo/bar/file.dat /really/long/path
...
<ctrl-r>foo

and I can stop typing as soon as the correct line appears. (Or, keep
pressing ctrl-r to step through previous matches.)
