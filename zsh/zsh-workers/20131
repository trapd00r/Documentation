It's historical.  zselect came first, because I needed it.  A sysselect
command would be much more logical now.  Maybe I'll think about moving
it and scheduling zselect for removal.  (However, if you don't load it
you don't get any penalty except a few dozen kilobytes of disk space, so
maybe just marking it as obsolete is good enough.)
