Yes this does work!  This gave me an idea.  Arrows work FINE
no matter how I do it *IF* I use up-arrow-or-history (which is what -me does).
But if I use my up-arrow-or-search then it doesn't work.  I did just 
a straight ./configure so I am not use modules or anything.  Do I need to
for the up-arrow-or-search to work?  

Thanks for getting me closer!!!

Thanks,
Andy
