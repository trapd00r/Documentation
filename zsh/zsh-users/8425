Greetings,

Is there an easy way to insert the currently applicable completions to
the command line as arguments?  In other words, if I have written
"ls --a" and C-d shows me that the possible completions at this
point are --all, --almost-all and --author, I would like to hit
some key that turns my command line into
"ls --all --almost-all --author".

Hannu
