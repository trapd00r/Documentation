in list contexts, command substitution is split according to the
$IFS special parameter.

IFS=$'\n'
lines=($(cmd))

$lines[<n>] will contain the <n>th non-empty line in cmd's
output.

To include empty lines:

IFS=$'\n\n'
output=$(cmd; echo .)
output=${output%?}
lines=(${=output%$'\n'})

We need this because $(...) removes all the trailing NL
characters, while we only want to remove the one for the last
line.
