Really?

I'm a huge fan of git, but if the SF git server were to go down, how is 
it any different than the SF CVS server going down?  Assuming the goal 
isn't to move away from having an 'official' repository, the only 
difference obvious to me is that you'd be able to work offline (i.e.  
still commit changesets to be pushed later).  But, the same is true when 
working off of the (unofficial?) git mirror.

I'm definitely *not* saying "Stay with CVS!".  Just curious about the 
better availability justification.
