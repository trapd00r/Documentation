This is what I put in INSTALL, I think it's clear on the subject.

  By default, the shell functions which are installed with `make install' or
  `make install.fns' go into the directory ${datadir}/zsh/functions, which
  unless you have specified --datadir is the same as
  ${prefix}/share/zsh/functions ($prefix itself defaults to /usr/local, as
  described below).  This directory will also be compiled into the shell as
  the default directory for the variable $fpath/$FPATH. You can override it
  with --enable-fndir=directory; --disable-fndir or --enable-fndir=no will
  turn off both installation of functions and the setting of a default value
  for $fpath/$FPATH.
