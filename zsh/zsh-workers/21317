Subject: PATCH: recursive globs with e qualifier hangs the shell

To reproduce, you can use something like this:
  print **/*(e:print **/*:)

It hangs because addpath in glob.c is called with pathbufsz zero. It
then goes into a while loop doing pathbufsz *= 2, never exiting because
pathbufsz never increases.

It is set to zero in save_globstate which seems like a strange thing to
do. Surely it should save the actual value instead of zero. Perhaps the
original intention was to set pathbufsz instead of (N).gd_pathbufsz to
zero. The patch below appears to fix it and I can't see any problem with
it. This isn't the first time we've had problems with that glob state
saving and I suspect it won't be the last. I've also included a test.
