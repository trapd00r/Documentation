The zshzle man page lists all the builtin widgets that zsh provides, and
the one that seems to do the trick for me is:

    expand-word (^X*) (unbound) (unbound)
        Attempt shell expansion on the current word.

Control-X followed by * (Shift-8) is bound in the emacs keymap.  That's
not exactly easy to type, but you should be able to map it to something
easier:

   bindkey '^X^D' expand-word
