Hi. I hope you don't mind me asking for a little information, but I figured that
since you people worked with shells, you might be able to help me. I have been
trying to create me own shell for a little while now, but I have had one small
problem. I have no been able to redirect the input/output for commands. Could 
you help me out here? Thanks.
