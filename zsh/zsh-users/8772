Let's say I have a directory /foo/bar that contains a large number of files=

and subdirectories. When I do this:

echo /foo/bar/**/^*,v(.[1,3])

I want it to echo the first three matching non-,v plain files.=20
Unfortunately, zsh still retrieves all filenames that match the glob. How=

possible is it to have the glob stop as soon as the first 3 matches are=20
found? I realize that other qualifiers could affect this (for example, if=
=20
you wanted the last 3, clearly, the whole glob has to be completed; if you=
=20
used 'o' or 'O' to sort, you might still have to glob everything). Perhaps=
=20
this isn't worth the effort or is quite difficult, but it's sure handy for=

large directories wherein you only need a well-defined subset of the files=

that isn't controlled solely by the glob expression.
