These still need fixing.

Also, I don't think it affects POSIX, because empty functions aren't
required to work, but in zsh, "fn() { }" is valid, and I suspect "fn"
logically ought to reset the status, too---basically anywhere where you've
run a complex command with an empty list of commands in it.
