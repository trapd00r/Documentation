Yes, and correct.  Although the window system knows the detailed state
of the keyboard, zsh is restricted to working with what it gets through
the TTY device, after the terminal emulator has done its thing.

No, you can assign the mappings just within the terminal emulator (e.g.
xterm) by using appropriate X resources.  You may even be able to limit
the remappings to instances of the emulator that have been given a
specific window name.  Look at the documentation for the terminal progam
to see what resources it supports.
