I've just looked at the documentation for stat to see how that might
work. It'd end up returning the string representation rather than a float
given the current interface. What exactly were you envisaging? It might
be more useful to have it available with the -F (format) option. The only
trouble there is that there is no standard for the letters to use in the
format specifiers.  date(1) on Linux has %N for nanoseconds. Apache uses
%q and %Q for milli and micro seconds. Do you know of any others?
