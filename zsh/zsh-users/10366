} My solution is to do something like this:
} echo "$LARGE_REQUEST" >&p &
} read REPLY <&p

In that case you don't have only two processes.  If one process "knows"
to fork for large writes, that process is prepared for the situation.
Most read-stdin/write-stdout unix commands that one might execute are
not so prepared, is my point.
