I just figured out the problem I was having; it was pilot error; in 4.0.1,
zfopen etc. work (to the extent that I tried them, at least) without first
running zfinit, but in 4.1.0-dev-x things get very confused if zfinit has
not been run.

So with 15895 applied and zfinit run properly, zfopen etc. work again.
Sorry about the red herring.
