Hi,

For the sake of argument, let's say I'm testing an interpreter* which
basically means I want to run an application, feed it some commands
from a file to STDIN, and depending on the results on its STDOUT, I
want to feed some other file.

That is, something like the following interactive session:

% interpreter < file_of_commands_A
Some output from interpreter: B
% interpreter < file_of_commands_A < file_of_commands_B

Though I'm not excacly sure the above will work, and, if possible, I'd
like to skip running the interpreter again, to preserve all possible
random-set states.

Of course I want all this to be automated in a script.  I hope I'm
making myself clear enough.


Johann

* That is, strictly speaking, not true, but I don't see a reason to
delve into the details here.
