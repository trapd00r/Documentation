Aha. I use an older version for Solaris, too. I don't remember exactly 
which version it was (and I modified the version string to something
useless but easily detectable, init-file-wise), but it's either a
vanilla 3.1.9 or older.

And it shows the same behaviour.

And trying the same version on DU4.0 shows it, too.

That means that the bug is already fixed in the current CVS, but I
don't know when it was fixed.

I can't reproduce the tty problem, though.

Bye
 Sven
