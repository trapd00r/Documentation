Err, actually what you're doing there is defining two functions, one
called vared and one called foo, with the same body.  The function>
prompt is the usual continuation prompt.  You'd get it just the same if
the first line were:
% foo() {

Of course, in a case like this you can simply up-arrow and edit the
foo()... a few lines before.

Clint's answer is the most useful... the function zed supplied with the
shell does this.  Remember to autoload it.  Pedantically,

autoload -Uz zed
zed -f foo

Hit ^J when you're finished (or ^X^W if your terminal is weird).
