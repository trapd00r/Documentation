So it seems that the zsh man pages (from zsh-3.1.5-pws-* and i am in
the process of checking zsh-3.1.6-test-3) confuse catman when making
the whatis file on solaris 7 to the point that they don't get added to
the whatis file. This causes man not to find the man pages because it
uses whatis first by default. Is there any workaround?
