I don't know the history of this, but it looks like someone got their
wires crossed, since the remnulargs() in the parsing code is obviously
incompatible with the singsub() in the exec code (er, for certain values
of `obviously').  I haven't dared remove the dupstring() but I suspect
it must be redundant, somehow.

By the way I think this sort of thing ought to work, too:

cat <<$'a\tb'
Here document
a	t

so I've made it.  Again, it does in bash.  That's the first hunk.
