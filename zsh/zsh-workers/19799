} so unless you have older archives, it won't be easy to find out.

I have zsh source dating back to 1993, before I even knew there *was* a
"declare" command, but it's there, and doesn't have -m.

  {"declare", bin_typeset, 0, -1, BINF_TYPEOPTS, 0, "LRZfilrtux", NULL},

I suspect the latter:  For source that old, it's almost all Paul's code,
and I suspect he implemented it as nearly as possible the way bash does.

} So I really don't see much harm in adding -m to declare's options.
} Or do you disagree?

No, I don't see any harm.  I think that means you should reverse the
sense of the test rather than remove the test, though.
