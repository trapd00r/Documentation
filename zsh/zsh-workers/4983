This is excellent --- I've been using completion trickery for things
like this, but this is very much more flexible.

One minor question is whether (Om) etc. should really be oldest first.
I can see that's logical --- `time order' certainly implies oldest
first --- but unfortunately it's the other way round from ls -t, which
is the order I've grown to expect.  I can easily get used to using ^,
though.
