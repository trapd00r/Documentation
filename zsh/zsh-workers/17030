There are other changes which I would have propagated but for the fact
that some completion functions have diverged a bit. _mount is one
particular example where to *easily* merge a bug fix, I'd have had to
merge a pile of other changes so I was lazy and left the bug.

15577 wouldn't be applicable to to dev trunk as it is effectively a
subset of 15574 which went only on the dev branch.

>From the perspective that the current dev branch is almost as stable
as 4.0 it would make some sense to declare a 4.2 to allow the users
to benefit from those 229 changes. If we hold out for big changes,
they may not happen for a while and then they'll take a while to
stabilise. I don't think the long 3.0 - 4.0 gap was ideal.

Would it work on platforms like Linux to link modules against those
they depend. Using external files would be ugly but I'd mind less if
they were only needed on some platforms.
