Turns out it was finding libgdbm in /opt/csw but needed the rpath
setting up.

Anyway, the gcc built zsh also has the problem so it isn't compiler
related. I tried running the minimal zsh -f, compctl test on Linux
through valgrind and I get the following message. Maybe valgrind has
found the source of the problem:

==647== Conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised value(s)

==647==    by 0x68FB864: makecomplistcmd (compctl.c:2492)

Valgrind also finds some leaked memory from parse_class (complete.c:467)
with the same test.
