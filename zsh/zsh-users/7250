The latter works perfectly.  The situation is even more pronounced on 
zsh under Cygwin, where completing a path with /cygdrive/<drive-letter> 
will cause your floppy drive to be accessed every time you attempt a new 
completion.  The accept-exact '*' resolves this issue wonderfully.  Many 
thanks!
