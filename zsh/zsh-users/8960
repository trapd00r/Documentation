The whole point of RPS1 is that it gets automatically hidden as command
input extends to the right into the space it occupies.  But with a two-
line prompt, your typing is never going to intersect with "[some more]".
So, really, putting it in PS1 is the right way to go about this.

However:

RPS1="%{$(echotc UP 1)%}[some more]%{$echotc DO 1)%}"
