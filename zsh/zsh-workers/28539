This is a well-known GCC extension:

5.21 Arithmetic on `void'- and Function-Pointers
================================================

In GNU C, addition and subtraction operations are supported on pointers
to `void' and on pointers to functions.  This is done by treating the
size of a `void' or of a function as 1.

 A consequence of this is that `sizeof' is also allowed on `void' and
on function types, and returns 1.

 The option `-Wpointer-arith' requests a warning if these extensions
are used.
