Subject: Completion regression?

Hi,

I have a small, annoying problem with completion of file names. I have some
files starting with "[". Until zsh 4.3.2 everything was fine and "echo

environment variables, which makes absolutely no sense to me.

Completion will still work if you use \[<tab>

I tracked down the problem with git bisect to this commit:
