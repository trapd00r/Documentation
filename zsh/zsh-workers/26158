Nothing firm, no.  There are various steps along the way, including
making highlighting dynamic, i.e. updating automatically when you insert
or delete characters.  Strict syntax highlighting (i.e. it really gets
parsed by the shell) probably is never going to happen, but some
approximate form (it gets split into words and examined by a shell
script) isn't beyond the bounds of possibility.  This isn't a very high
priority.

Anything requiring enhancements to the completion system is likely to
have to wait even longer.

This is all entirely for the practical reasons Bart mentioned.
