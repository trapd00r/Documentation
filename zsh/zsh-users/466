No.  Arguments in $PAGER might or might not work, depending on the
program interpreting it.  (I am of the opinion that they should not
work.)

It might be useful to allow $READNULLCMD to be an array, containing
arguments, through which *any* command could be executed using eval.
This obviously can't be done to $PAGER, so these should not be merged.
