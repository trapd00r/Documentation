} 
} This doesn't work either. I have:
} 
} $ ll -R **/*(^/)
} -r--r--r--   1 lefevre  polka        1558 Oct 25 14:08 RCS/lepois
} -r--r--r--   1 lefevre  polka         895 Oct 25 14:07 lepois
} 
} No completion at all for co -x.

It only looks for files that end in ",v".  Then it deletes the ,v and shows
you the corresponding "working" file.  You can't "co" a file that doesn't
have a ",v" file, so it's not necessarily wrong for it to ignore all other
files.  It is, however, wrong that it doesn't also look for the ",v " file
in the current directory.
