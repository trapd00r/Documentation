>From zshcompwid.1:

              -1     If given together with the -V option,  makes
                     only  consecutive duplicates in the group be
                     removed. Note that groups with  and  without
                     this flag are in different name spaces.

              -2     If  given together with the -J or -V option,
                     makes all duplicates be kept. Again,  groups
                     with  and without this flag are in different
                     name spaces.

I deduce that -1 cannot be used with -J.

>From Completion/Core/_tags:

      compadd -J "$name"
      compadd -V "$name"
      compadd -J "$name" -1
      compadd -V "$name" -1
      compadd -J "$name" -2
      compadd -V "$name" -2

I deduce that it can.

Which is wrong?
