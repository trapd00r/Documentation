} No, it doesn't, because that uses (spbreak = 2), hence the test.

Sorry, I was writing in shorthand for:

setopt shwordsplit
for x in ${1-some words here}; do echo $x; done

It's not sufficient just to twaddle spbreak -- it's necessary to actually
parse the string and interpret quoting, but I think by the time multsub
is done the quotes have already been stripped out.
