The following redirections for compressed files seem to work quite
nicely --- uncompress input from the appropriate compressed file type, and
compress output into it.  Was anyone planning anything more sophisticated?

It seems vaguely preferable to allow the user to omit trailing
`,-default-' bits when defining commands (it's not important in style
contexts since you would usually use a wildcard anyway), but it doesn't
actually gain you anything apart from laxity.

It seems more logical that the command variant should take precedence,
although the order of the parts would imply otherwise.

This seems OK unless we do something more complicated with pattern
handling, e.g. some way of matching the point at which you want the
pattern tried.  But I don't see any great call for that at the moment.
