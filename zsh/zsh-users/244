It is surprising that the there days before the final 2.0 release a new
feature appeared.  Here is the patch.  I think zsh will be the first shell
which can set this new limit.  There is no patch to the manual simply
because I do not know what is this limit.  Also a new flag should be
inveted to set this limit with ulimit.

Please tell me your suggestions.
