We have been trying to change sys_errlist from `const char *const[]'
back to `char *[]', or, better yet, get people to stop using it
entirely.  Towards the latter, it would be nice if zsh's utils.c
would use strerror() rather than sys_errlist, with a `backup'
implementation that uses sys_errlist[argument] for systems that
lack strerror (perhaps even providing this backup in the form of
a strerror() implementation).

I will leave the exact details up to you -- you have some existing
HAVE_* macros, and I would recommend adding HAVE_STRERROR here,
unless you would prefer to simply provide an auxiliary `strerror.c'
source file, using it only on those systems that lack strerror().

Chris
