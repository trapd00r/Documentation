I think it would be BAD if bash had a similar system to zsh. It would
create confusion and increase work if one would want to use the same
completion scripts for both shells. So we should really try to have at
least a common base. I don't know if the two systems could be totally
compatible, since probably bash doesn't implement some needed features
like assiocative arrays. If this is impossible, the bash system should
at least not look similar.

Could probably some competent person contact the bash maintainers on
this topic?
