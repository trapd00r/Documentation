hmm, it wasn't me, but now:
  /etc/zshrc: file exists: /dev/null [243]
am I just going to have to live with this?  Seems quite a lot to live with.
Particularly since I can't alter this, and the system manager on this
machine complains with every incompatibility he has to work around.
I earnestly hope some workaround at least for /dev/null can be found.
