If you are using Amol Deshpande's port, make sure you have the most recent
copy (version 0.50 or later).  I reported this same bug a while ago; see
	http://www.zsh.org/mla/users/1998/msg00605.html
for details of the fix Amol did.  I don't rembember whether he also fixed
the crash I described in that thread.

} 2) A second problem: Zsh doesn't write an history file for me

Stephen Marley's answer about SAVEHIST is correct.
