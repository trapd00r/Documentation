I think making cache file for each directory in fpath reduce start
time. Because the directory that contains many files
--- /usr/local/share/zsh/functions --- is stable in many case (except
for some zsh developpers).

I feel that a state machine is the good abstraction for command line
parsing.

Hm. I think it is reasonable to implement a state as a function.
A state transition can be represented as return from the function with
next state.
