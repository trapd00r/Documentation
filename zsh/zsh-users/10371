Actually, it's the other way round: the WORDCHARS parameter specifies which=
=20
characters (in addition to alphanumeric characters) are considered part of=
=20
words. It contains several characters that make sense by default, so I thin=
k=20
your best course of action would be to just exclude slashes:

WORDCHARS=3D${WORDCHARS//\/}
