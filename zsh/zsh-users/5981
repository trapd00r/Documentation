Thanks for both - nice to know and to use - great!

But one use I was looking for was to write(1) to another terminal viz.
echotc AF 6 ; echotc AB 4 ; echo "Cyan on Blue"|write eric /dev/pts/3
or 
print "$bg[cyan]$fg[blue]Blue on Cyan"|write eric /dev/pts/3

but alas no colors on the destination terminal (of course this does not prove
it but trust me):
[eric@pear ~] 3 $
Message from eric@pear on pts/2 at 22:48 ...
Cyan on Blue
EOF

Message from eric@pear on pts/4 at 22:52 ...
^[[46m^[[34mBlue on Cyan
EOF


oops - this just came in (same issue):

print "\e[3${i}mFred $i here\e[0m"|write eric /dev/pts/3

Message from eric@pear on pts/4 at 22:56 ...
^[[3mFred  here^[[0m
EOF

Perhaps I am being greedy - I learnt a great new trick today.

Thanks guys ...
