I using the following zsh system wide configuration (/etc/zsh/zshrc):
  
unlimit
limit stack 8192
limit core 0
limit -s

And i have set no modifications to the above commands in the usr
configurtaion  (as far as i can see). 

Yet some (kde) applications often crash dumping a large core file. 

Will you please help me to figure out what is wrong?

thank you
