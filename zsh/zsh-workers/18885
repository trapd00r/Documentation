I'd say it shouldn't be in the parameter module because as you say, that
interfaces to shell rather than system information. I'd just call the
module `system'. The `z' seems a bit redundant especially as it is
effectively zsh/system with the namespace.

I'd have thought just $errnos would be fine. Especially if it can be in
a system namespace in the long term.

By during configuration, do you mean by autoconf? When the module is
loaded would be better. If it's in an out of the way module that isn't
loaded by default, I don't think it matters. That long over due parameter
code rewrite will have to allow individual array elements to be generated
on demand.
