here's a neat trick i just figured out... have the time that's displayed 
in your prompt update itself!

below is a sample with the first PS1 comented out... that would *just* 
display the time. the second example is a little more powerful...


## run TRAPALRM every $TMOUT seconds
TMOUT=30

TRAPALRM () {
     ## reset-prompt - this will update the prompt
     zle reset-prompt
}

## this PS1 will use "%T" to display the current time,
## updated every $TMOUT seconds
## example of prompt-expansion
#PS1='%S%T %#%s '


## this PS1 will use the `uptime` command to display system stats,
## updated every $TMOUT seconds
## example of prompt command substitution
setopt PROMPT_SUBST
PS1='%S$(uptime)
%#%s '
