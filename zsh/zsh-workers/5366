This has been tested on AIX 3.2, IRIX 6.2, Solaris 5.6 (dynamic) and HPUX
10.20 (dynamic and static).

The major changes are the configure test for signames.c, which should now
be more reliable, and the rearrangement of the new completion stuff into
Functions/Completion (moved from Misc).  Although this is not set in stone,
it should be more usable as you can put any of the __* files you fancy into
your autoload path and then source the file init to use them (existing
compctl's for the same commands take precedence).  In particular, the file
__mh for completing MH commands shows the benefits of the new system: it
replaces a mish-mash of about a dozen complicated compctls and three
separate functions into a single, much neater function.

The changes are


Geoff: no ld -g for NetBSD, 5295

Bart: alter local variables and $argv documentation, 5297

Bart: PWD and OLDPWD export confusion (fixing, not creating), 5299

Bart: trashzle() crashed shell with dynamical loading and zle builtin,
5305

Matt: CHAR(+) -> CHAR(43) in zmacros, 5311

Sven: compctl matcher to use reference counts, 5316

Sven: keys available in zle widget functions, 5320

Me: compctl -LM, 5321

Me: revamped signames.c generation, 5326, 5329, plus Matt fix, 5330

Sweth, Bart, Me: Functions/allopt, basically as in 2121 with the odd
emulate and local.

Me: emulate -L, 5332

Sven: printing of zle condition codes, 5335

Sven: Modularisation of new completion shell code, 5341

Sven: ignoring ignored prefix in new conditions, 5342; related fixes,
5343

Me: patch for completion init and __normal, 5344; Sven fix, 5351

Me: "$foo[@]" didn't remove the argument if $foo wasn't set, 5349;
Bart's fix so this works on OSes other than AIX, 5361

Sven: change fignore handling, 5352

Sven: redisplay of completion lists; remove display when completion
failed, 5354

Sven: compadd -R function for suffix removal, 5355

Me: #key-* completions now allow 0 or more key bindings, 5362

Me: Moved Misc/Completion to Functions/Completion; added some of my own
new-style completions: not posted

Me: 5281 now works, 5364

Me: make dependencies for main.o, Makemod, zshpaths.h, 5365
