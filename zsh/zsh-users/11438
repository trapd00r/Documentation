I found a weird problem yesterday, if i type 'which svmode' after
sourcing [1] (from zsh -f), zsh allocates all free memory then ooms.
(so set ulimit -v 50000 or so before trying). The strange thing is it
works fine if i cat the file and paste it in the terminal.

I tried reproducing it with a smaller file with dummy functions but
that didn't crash. I don't have debug symbols in right now but here's
a hopefully partly useful backtrace,
(gdb) bt
