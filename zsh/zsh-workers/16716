I've never heard anyone ask for it, but it might be useful in the same
cases where (#i) is useful.  On the other hand, it'd be nicest to have
the sort be case-insensitive only in the regions where the glob itself
is case-insentive, which is probably a prohibitive amount of work.

} pointer of the VARARRs to pass on to nstrpcmp()?

I think that's about the best you can do given that you don't know whether
VARARR() will produce a stack array or an allocated pointer.
