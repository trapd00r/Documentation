Here's the sort of thing I get (from the top of a linux-2.4.2-ac20
tree):

# time make -nsp --no-print-directory -f Makefile .PHONY > /dev/null
make -nsp --no-print-directory -f Makefile .PHONY > /dev/null  28.85s user 3.09s system 97% cpu 32.609 total

This is with the standard Debian packages, zsh-3.1.9.dev8-2 and
make-3.79.1-4.  It's a fast machine (800MHz Athlon) with lots of
memory and decent disks, so it's not that.

I'm guessing there's some difference in make behaviour.  Presumably
this is relevant:

# make -nsp --no-print-directory -f Makefile .PHONY | wc -l
1494859

Anything that's producing that amount of output is going to take a
little while to run.
