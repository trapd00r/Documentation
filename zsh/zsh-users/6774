Really? As far as I can see, they both get exactly the same word
splitting:

% a=( print -l one two three\ four 'five\ six' )
% eval "$a[@]"
one
two
three
four
five six

% eval "b=( $a )"
% "$b[@]"
one
two
three
four
five six

That's odd. But, as we're using autoload -U, that has no effect on
_argumemts.
