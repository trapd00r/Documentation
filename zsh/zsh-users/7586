yeah I did something like this a long time ago, but since it rarely changes
per-machine, it was overkill

PATH=""

for dir in /usr/bin /bin /sbin /usr/local/sbin /usr/local/bin $HOME/bin
do

    if [[ -d $dir ]]
    then

        PATH=$dir:$PATH

    fi

done

(Note: that list of dirs is in reverse order of preference due to the way
the loop is put together, to avoid ':' as the first character in the PATH
string.

Does that go through the current $PATH and delete all the folders that
aren't listed in there?

Is it supposed to be lowercase?
