For a regex, I don't know, but you can select the files that don't
match a glob pattern. The natural way is to follow the pattern with ~
and the pattern that represent the files you don't want.

Suppose you want to match all files except those matching *.pdf :
*~*.pdf

Suppose you want to match *.pdf except t*.pdf, just write
*.pdf~t*.pdf

And that's it.
