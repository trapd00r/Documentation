Yes, you need to indicate to zsh that part of the prompt doesn't take
up any space on the screen:

PS1="%{$(print "\033")]2;[ $_U ]%m: %/$(print "\007 \r")%}$PSB "
     ^^                                                 ^^

But in this case it would be better to use the chpwd feature:

function chpwd {
  print -nP "\033]2;[ $_U ]%m: %/\007"
}

chpwd gets executed every time the current directory changes.  Other
things of this nature can be done using precmd, which is executed
before the prompt is displayed.
