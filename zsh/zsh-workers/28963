Subject: "Remote" execution - is this possible?

Hi,

on a remote machine to which I have root access I'd like to
fix some environment setting for running zsh processes, i.e.

there are some xterms running zsh.

I'd like to achieve the effect as if a local user had entered
export BROWSER=firefox
in his xterm.

Is this possible?

Many thanks for a hint,
Helmut.
