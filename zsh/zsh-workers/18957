    Hi Peter :)

    This message is just for informing you about a typo in the user
friendly guide: in section 3.2.6 of the current offline version, you
can read that a parameter has 'dynamic' or 'syntactic' scope, and I
think you refer to 'dynamic' or 'static' scope ;)

    BTW, the guide is amazingly useful, you should update it with the
new capabilities of zsh. I know, it's a hard, tedious and never
completely grateful job, but this guide is great as is, and an update
will make it simply perfect.

    Thanks a lot for this guide. It is what a user manual should be ;)
