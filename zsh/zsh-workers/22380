Subject: Updating the zsh.sourceforge.net website

I noticed that the News section of the zsh.sourceforge.net website was
out of date, so I took steps to update it.  To do so I had to duplicate
the entire htdocs subdir because it didn't have the group-write
permission enabled.  This old hierarchy is still around, but now named
htdocs.old.  The new hierarchy is writable by group zsh.  I updated the
News page and the date-stamp for the News section on the main page.

OK?  Have I made life difficult for anyone by making this update?
