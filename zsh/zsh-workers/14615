} [1] My only suggestion at this time would be to think about changing the
}     warnings to `warning: job is still suspended' (i.e. inserting that
}     `still' to make it clearer that the job has been disowned but is
}     still sleeping).  Dunno.

Or what about something actually useful, like:

  disown: disowned a stopped job (use `kill -CONT -<pgrp here>')

where <pgrp here> is of course the actual pgrp of the stopped job.  Is
there a reason that won't work?

}     Adding a flag to tell bin_fg() that it's a
}     `%1 &!' and then calling killjb() there isn't hard to implement
}     either, of course, but we got no comments on this, so...

Oops, sorry, I meant to comment on it:

} I would actually prefer it if they would differ.  The only possible way
} to implement this is adding a global variable that gets set in execcmd()
} and tested in bin_fg().

As you point out:

} execcmd() actually inserts a `disown' into the list of command words

So don't insert a `disown'.  Insert `bg' and delete the job table entry
in execcmd() the way it's done in execpline2().
