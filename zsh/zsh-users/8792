Hello everyone!

I am having some difficulty on one of the two boxes I installed
zsh on today. The box having problems won't let no prompt appear
unless I type CTRL+C. Even after I do that, it's not the prompt
I've specified in /etc/zshrc.

Also, I need help modifying the theme 'elite2' into looking just
a little bit better. I've done a 'vared PS1' to get the prompt
out of where ever it's hidden.

It looks like this (with a nice green color scheme):

(johann@urban)(1/ttyp3)(09:26P:05/08/05)-
(%:~)-

I need it to look like this though:

(johann@urban)(21:26:05/08/05)-
(%:~)-

Yeah, basically the 1/ttyp3 has been removed and the time format
changed to the European format. 'vared PS1' returns:

%{^[[01;32m%}(%{^[[22;32m%}%n%{^[[01;30m%}@%{^[[22;32m%}%m%{^[[01;32m%})%{^=
[[01;32m%}(%{^[[22;32m%}%!%{^[[01;30m%}/%{^[[22;32m%}%y%{^[[01;32m%})%{^[[0=
1;32m%}(%{^[[22;32m%}%D{%I:%M%P}%{^[[01;30m%}:%{^[[22;32m%}%D{%m/%d/%y}%{^[=
[01;32m%})%{^[[01;30m%}-%{^[[00m%}
%{^M%}%{^[[01;32m%}(%{^[[22;32m%}%#%{^[[01;30m%}:%{^[[22;32m%}%~%{^[[01;32m=
%})%{^[[01;30m%}-%{^[[00m%}

And here is my /etc/zshrc:

umask 022

alias vi=3D'vim'
alias j=3D'jobs -l'
alias h=3D'history'
alias ls=3D'ls -G'
alias cd..=3D'cd ..'
alias cd...=3D'cd ../..'
alias cd....=3D'cd ../../..'
alias cd.....=3D'cd ../../../..'
alias cd......=3D'cd ../../../../..'
alias cd/=3D'cd /'
alias wf=3D'w -f'
alias ws=3D'w -s'
alias df=3D'df -h'
alias ftp=3D'lftp'

ports=3D/usr/ports
src=3D/usr/src
var=3D/var

autoload -U compinit
compinit

autoload promptinit
promptinit

prompt elite2 green

if [[ `whoami` =3D root ]] then
prompt elite2 red
fi

if [[ $TERM =3D eterm ]] then
export TERM=3Dxterm-color
fi

I hope someone can help me.
Thanks!
