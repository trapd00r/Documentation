Subject: AVFS completion?

Does anyone have a completion widget for AVFS?  AVFS allows the user to
cd or ls archives of various types with a syntax like this:
0 > cd mail_mode.sl.tar.gz#/

The trailing '#' activates AVFS.  Basically, 'cd <tab> should include
archives, and add the '#' if selected.  I suspect this is fairly easy
to do, but I don't understand zsh completions enough to layer this on
top of the existing cd and ls completions.

Thanks,
   Omen

If it happens, it must be possible.
