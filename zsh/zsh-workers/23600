That's how aliases work: they're handled very early, before processing
of quotes, so it looks like the suffix is `ogg"'.  If you use
backslashes you won't have that problem.  Completion used to convert
automatically to backslashed form but it doesn't any more (I think I've
bitten off my than I can chew here, actually, but I can't put my finger
on exactly how it happened anyway).  With 4.3 the following ZLE widget
will do it:

backslashify() {
    modify-current-argument '${(q)${(Q)ARG}}'
}
autoload -U modify-current-argument
zle -N backslashify
