Once again - there is currently no easy way to remove defenition of
deleted function from wordcode file. I'm using zrecompile -p as
suggested - and just now I deleted _bunzip2, run zrecompile (with small
wrapper) - and of course, _bunzip2 remained in wordcode file.

my function is:

#!/tools/bin/zsh -f
autoload -U zrecompile
zrecompile -p -- ~/.zsh.d/std-$ZSH_VERSION.zwc
/tools/share/zsh/$ZSH_VERSION/functions/*/*(^/)

and when I run it nothing happens at all.

BTW completion for zcompile does not list -t option (at least).

Have a nice DOS!
