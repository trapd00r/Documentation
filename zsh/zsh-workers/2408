I for one would like that to happen.  It's really annoying to have (())
changed to let when listing functions.  It's also confusing to have
(()) fail after "disable let".

It only really makes a difference when patching the module code
itself.  IMO we shouldn't be posting patches for `configure' itself
anyway; they are large and contain no information.  (zsh developers can
be assumed to have autoconf available.)
