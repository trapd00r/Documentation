It's described in the INSTALL file.

... The shell then executes code in the file
scripts/newuser in the shared library area (by default
/usr/local/share/zsh/<VERSION>/scripts/newuser).  This feature can be
turned off simply by removing this script.  The module can be removed
entirely from the configured shell by editing the line starting
"name=zsh/newuser" in the config.modules file, which is generated in the
top level distribution directory during configuration: change the line to
include "link=no auto=no".
