That is all I suggest that should be done. I have spent days chasing
this problem and I see no reason why others should do the same.I
understand perfectly well that this is the defined behaviour and I
don't mind if you have to read the manpage to circumvent the problem.
I just want to spare others the pains and efforts I have taken to
solve it.
