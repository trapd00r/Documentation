    I finally modified the shell function to do all string processing
first. After that, I just do "print $_rawmode -n -- $_string". So I
can do the printing in one step and the string processing in two (one
is the truncation+padding, the second is the optional padding
removal).

    I'm afraid I was misreading your suggestion: both things were done
in just one step and I thought the first expansion was the truncation
and padding and the second the padding removal. Sorry for the noise
and thanks a lot, as always, for your kind help.

    When I test the function I will probably post it here just in
case the code can be improved or anyone is interested in using it.

    Thanks again :)
