perl's OK.  A quick look at perl(1) will generally indicate which man
page actually contains the desired information, which one can the drag
a regexp over.  It's the same with zsh, except that zshall(1) can be
used to skip the first step (provided, of course, you have a caching
(or exceptionally fast) man pager).

Actually lynx uses curses; it's not limited to vt100s.

For me, it's much more effective to have all the documentation in one
place, and browse it with my preferred pager.  Hypertext just gets in
the way of the information, and there still isn't a hypertext system
that formats to look as good as man pages.  (And have you ever tried to
read `all the documentation' on some subject, when said documentation
is arranged as an arbitrary directed graph of fifty nodes of two pages
each?)
