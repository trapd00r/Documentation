I just checked... I didn't find much (as in 'sufficient')
documentation in zshall(1) on the spelling correction. Not even a
short blurb on what the '[nyae ]' of SPROMPT means... something like
(always be constructive in your criticism):


  After being prompted for spelling correction, the user can choose to

    + let zsh correct it, by pressing 'y' or SPACE,

    + run the command without any correction, by pressing 'n',

    + not run the command at all, by pressing 'a', or

    + edit the command before executing, by pressing 'e'.

  Obviously, 'y' stands for 'yes', 'n' for 'no', 'a' for 'abort' (or
  something...), and 'e' stands for 'edit'.

Important is the 'a' and 'e'. I just found out by trying... which is
what the docs should be for, right?

And if this is corrected (no pun intended) in 3.1.1ff, I take
everything back and say the opposite ;-)

Bye, J

PS: I looooooooooooove my zsh.

PPS: You can tell by my subscribing to zsh-workers... I don't know
what help I can lend... but documenting the 'shit' comes to mind (see
my comments on the 'whence -s' hack).
