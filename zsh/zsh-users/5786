That is very nice.  The functionality is exactly what
I had in mind.  Once again, I'm very impressed with
Zsh! :)

One note about the user interface of this
"interactive" menu completion mode:  Why have a
'vi-insert' key binding at all?  I don't see any
reason for it.  IMHO "interactive" mode should be able
to be toggled on or off permanently (maybe throuth
styles).

cheers.
