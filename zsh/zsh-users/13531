Yes, that's what I've been using until now. The problem is that I don't 
know what a program that expects an argument will do if it receives no 
argument. It might simply print help or await input from stdin. So the 
default is for me exactly the best. Only the zsh's error is a kind of a 
cosmetic problem in script (while interactively it's of course what I 
want).
