:I'm not a key developer,

Who are these ``key developer''s?  We just have
1) a bunch of general users submitting changes, releasing them on the
   (unsuspecting *) beta testers, then sending patches to fix the
   typos/brainos/whatever.
2) a coordinator (or, as now, pro tem. coordinator) who somehow gets all
   those patches which look/sound/feel OK to not collide.

(* unsuspecting if you're naive :-) )

:feel free to tell me to get lost or whatever.

Regards,
