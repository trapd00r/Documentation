This seems to work fine so far, and the prompt truncation also seems
to be fixed. I just noticed the following while testing when i missed
the space bar,
% echoちとしはちとしはち
zsh: command not found:
echo\M-c\M-^A\M-!\M-c\M-^A\M-(\M-c\M-^A\M-^W\M-c\M-^A\M-/\M-c\M-^A\M-!\M-c\M-^A\M-(\M-c\M-^A\M-^W\M-c\M-^A\M-/\M-c\M-^A\M-!

Maybe the error message could show multibyte printable characters too?
