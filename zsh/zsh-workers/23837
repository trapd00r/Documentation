I can reproduce this, with the styles you sent, and I can vaguely see that
the struct cline list passed to cline_str in compresult.c is out of order
so that the function is inserting a "-" first, then the "worpress" chunk, e=
tc.
However, that's already taken well over an hour and I currently haven't a
clue how it's got that way.
