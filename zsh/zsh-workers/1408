ksh93 has many powerful features for scripts.  I admit that for scripts
sometime ksh93 may be better than zsh.  But after the zsh-3.0 we can add
the missing features.  I have already made some experiments with dynamic
loading.  It is very easy to implement is on elf systems.  What I do not
know yet is the best interface to modules.  Mudules will certainly appear
after zsh-3.0 is out.
