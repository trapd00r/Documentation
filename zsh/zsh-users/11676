I am using the following command in /etc/zsh/zshrc to change the title bar
and tab bar according to the current directory:

precmd () {
     tab_lable="$PWD:h:t/$PWD:t"
     rlength="20"   # number of characters to appear before truncation from
the left
    
    dcop "$KONSOLE_DCOP_SESSION" renameSession "$tab_lable[-$rlength,-1]"
                                                                                 
    }        

When running vim, the running command is added to  <current dir>, in the
title and tab names. 
However, as vim has been closed, title bar and tab name take the form:  
<current dir> Konsole <current dir>           

That is not what expected 

What is wrong?

thank you
