    Hi Bart :)

    Oh, my... Thanks, Bart, you're great :)

    Why it doesn't happen with executable names (which has an
asterisk added) or other kind of files? I mean, why 'listtypes'
doesn't have the same effect?

    But the same is not applicable to 'listtypes'. Doesn't seem that
weird?

    Yes, I've took a look at it: very clever and useful :)) Thanks a
lot, Bart, as always :)
