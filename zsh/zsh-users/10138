Okay,

This is a pretty simple problem, but after looking over the documentation, =
I
cannot figure out what is wrong. If I type

alias emacs=3D'emacs -nw'

at the command line, I would expect 'emacs -nw' to replace whenever I type
'emacs'. This does does not happen, and instead emacs opens in a windows as
usual.

What gives?

Stephen
