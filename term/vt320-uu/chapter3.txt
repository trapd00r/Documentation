                                 3 The Keyboard

   The keyboard (Figure 3-1) has four groups of keys, four indicator
   lights, and two audible indicators. There are 15 models of the keyboard
   available (Appendix D). This chapter shows the North American/United
   Kingdom keyboard. The keys are grouped by function.
     * Main keypad
     * Editing keypad
     * Numeric keypad
     * Top-row function keys

   CAPTION: Figure 3-1 Keyboard

   CAPTION: Figure 3-2 Main Keypad

Main Keypad

   This keypad (Figure 3-2) is similar to a standard typewriter keyboard.
   The main keypad has the following special function keys.

   Tab The Tab key sends a horizontal tab, which normally moves the cursor
   to the next tab stop on the line. You can use the Tab Set-Up screen
   (Chapter 4) to select tab stops.
   Ctrl Holding down the Ctrl key and pressing another key sends a control
   code to the system. For example, Ctrl-Z means to hold down Ctrl and
   press the Z key. A control code tells the system to perform a special
   function.
   Lock If you use the "Caps Lock" setting in the Keyboard Set-Up screen
   (Chapter 4), pressing Lock makes the alphabetic keys send uppercase
   characters. If you use the "Shift Lock" setting, pressing Lock makes
   all the keys send the top character on the key. When you release Lock,
   all keys send their bottom character.
   Shift

   Holding down the Shift key and pressing another key sends the uppercase
   (or top) character on the key.

   In some cases, you use Shift with another key to perform a local
   function. For example, Shift-Print Screen means to hold down Shift and
   press the Print Screen key.
   Return

   The Return key sends either a carriage return or a carriage return and
   line feed (selected in the General Set-Up screen, Chapter 4).

   Pressing Return usually moves the cursor to the next line. Many
   applications use Return to indicate the end of a command.
   <x]
   (Delete) The <x] key sends either a delete (DEL) character or a
   backspace (BS) character (selected in the Keyboard Set-Up screen,
   Chapter 4). Many applications use <x] to erase one character to the
   left of the cursor. Pressing Ctrl- <x] sends a CAN (cancel) character.
   Compose Character This key lets you generate characters that do not
   appear as standard keys on your keyboard. See Chapter 5.

   CAPTION: Figure 3-3 Editing and Numeric Keypads

Editing Keypad

   The editing keypad (Figure 3-3) has six editing keys and four arrow
   keys. Pressing an arrow key normally moves the cursor in the direction
   of the arrow. For example, pressing the [Down] key moves the cursor
   down one line. The function of the editing keys depends on the software
   application you use. See your application manuals for details.

Numeric Keypad

   Numeric keypad keys (Figure 3-3) often have functions assigned by your
   application software -- especially PF1, PF2, PF3, and PF4. See your
   application manuals for details. Some applications let you use the
   numeric keypad to enter numeric data as you would with a calculator.

   Enter The Enter key normally works like the Return key. That is, Enter
   sends a carriage return or a carriage return and line feed (selected in
   the General Set-Up screen, Chapter 4). You also use Enter to change
   set-up feature settings and select set-up action features.

   CAPTION: Figure 3-4 Top-Row Function Keys and Indicator Lights

Top-Row Function Keys

   The first five top-row keys on the left (Figure 3-4) have predefined
   functions, described below. You cannot change these functions. Your
   application software can define the function of the remaining top-row
   keys. See your application manuals for details.

   Hold Screen

   This key freezes data on the screen, so you can read it. When you press
   Hold Screen, the Hold Screen indicator turns on.

   Pressing Hold Screen again releases the screen, so new data can appear.
   The Hold Screen indicator turns off.
   Print Screen

   This key sends text from the screen to a printer connected to the
   terminal.

   Pressing Ctrl-Print Screen turns auto print mode on or off. See "Auto
   Print Mode" in Chapter 6.
   Set-Up This key lets you enter or leave set-up (Chapter 4).
   F4 This key is disabled.
   Break

   This key works alone or with other keys to perform functions that
   affect communication between your terminal and system. You can disable
   the Break function in the Keyboard Set-Up screen (Chapter 4).
     * In some applications, pressing Break ends communication with your
       system.
     * Pressing Shift-Break ends communication with a modem.
     * Pressing Ctrl-Break sends the answerback message to the system. See
       the Keyboard Set-Up screen (Chapter 4).

   F11
   (ESC) F11 is a function key often defined by application software. In
   VT100 and VT52 modes, F11 sends an escape (ESC) character.
   F12
   (BS) F12 is a function key often defined by application software. In
   VT100 and VT52 modes, F12 sends a backspace (BS) character.
   F13
   (LF) F13 is a function key often defined by application software. In
   VT100 and VT52 modes, F13 sends a line feed (LF) character.

Indicator Lights

   The keyboard has four indicator lights (Figure 3-4).

   Hold Screen Turns on or off when you press the Hold Screen key.
   Lock Turns on or off when you press the Lock key.
   Compose Turns on when you are typing a compose sequence (Chapter 5).
   Wait Turns on when the keyboard is locked (cannot send data). You can
   clear a locked keyboard by selecting the Clear Comm feature from the
   Set-Up Directory screen (Chapter 4).

Audible Indicators

   The keyboard has two audible indicators, a keyclick and a bell. You can
   use a margin bell, warning bell, or both. You select the keyclick and
   bell setting from the Keyboard Set-Up screen (Chapter 4).

   Keyclick

   All keys that send a code or perform a function make a clicking sound
   when pressed, except under the following exceptions.
     * You press Shift or Ctrl. These keys never make a keyclick sound.
     * The Wait indicator is on. No keys can make a keyclick sound.
     * You turn off the Keyclick set-up feature.

   Bell

   The margin bell sounds when the cursor is eight characters from the
   right margin.

   The warning bell tone sounds for any of the following conditions.
     * During the power-up self-test
     * When the terminal receives a bell (BEL) character from the system
     * After a compose character error
