I'm a wee bit red faced... :)

I didn't really appreciate that MAXJOBS is sort of taking on the role of a
control structures stack.   In which case, a dynamic solution seems reasonable.

Currently I'm building with MAXJOBS doubled, figuring that should cover it for
me.   Though I suspect most users have prebuilt versions of zsh, and so might
hit this problem.
