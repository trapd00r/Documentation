in this case you need to use $service in completion function to distinguish 
between the two and use correct options. Usually it  is done like

common_opts=(optspec optspec2 ...)
case $service in
  cmd1 )
    _arguments $common_opts cmd1_optsec1 cmd1_optspec2 ...
  ;;
  cmd2 )
    _arguments $common_opts cmd2_optspec1 cmd2_optspec2 ...
  ;;
  ...
esac

completion system sets $service to the name of command for which we complete.
Then just stick firefox in #compdef line.
