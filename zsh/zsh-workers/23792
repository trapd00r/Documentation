Subject: PATCH: test of improved backslash quoting
Date: Wed, 22 Aug 2007 11:35:53 +0100
From: Peter Stephenson <pws@csr.com>

This tests the code I added to improved the output of expansion for
invalid or unprintable characters.  As I implied, but possibly didn't
make entirely clear, this affects any case where backslash quoting is
added, including the parameter (q) flag.  I've expanded the
documentation for this.

Note that removal of $'...' quotes is not currently well handled: this
applies both to the (Q) parameter flag and to completion, where already
added $'\...' quoting isn't properly parsed for further handling.  This
is part of the hairy patch I've been trying to do to improve completion
with nested quotes; however, the (Q) part is useful separately and a bit
more tractable, so I'll try and drag it out since it's likely to be
several orders of magnitude quicker than trying to complete the full
patch.
