I'm sorry, I don't understand.  You're in insert mode, and you're
inserting at the "folk", right?  (That's what your description implies
with the usual key bindings.)  Then of course you won't be editing "foo
", you'll be inserting new text in front of "folk".

Do you mean you can't use the cursor key to go backward?

Do you mean you hit "b" *twice* to go back to the "foo" and you expect
to be in overwrite mode rather than insert mode so that you type over
the "foo"?

Do you mean you were expecting the effect of "I" (capital important)
which takes you to the start of the line and then puts you in insert
mode?
