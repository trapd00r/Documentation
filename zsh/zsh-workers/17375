What's happening is that it's trying to complete files which aren't
already owned by the group `adm'.  So the file completion code in
_path_files uses a pattern for that purpose.  It then complains if the
group `adm' doesn't exist.  However, it should only do that if the group
adm *really* doesn't exist on your system.  Are you sure it does?  In
which case the problem is somewhere inside zsh, to do with its interface
with the system commands for reading groups.
