It seems a little bit non-orthoganal that you can only have one
coprocess.  (And I think that probably defeats some of the potential
value of coprocesses, which otherwise would let multiple background
pipelines communicate with each other in arbitrarily complex ways.  Has
anybody thought about the possibility of adding support for multiple
coprocesses to some misty future version of zsh?  Or am I missing the
point of supporting a coprocess?  (Entirely plausible, since I've never
used them.)
