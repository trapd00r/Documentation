Hello workers.

Let's assume someone wants colorful completion for kill(1):

[snip]
autoload -U compinit && compinit
zmodload -i zsh/complist
zstyle ':completion:*:kill:*' command 'ps xf -u $USER -o pid,%cpu,cmd'
zstyle ':completion:*:*:kill:*:processes' list-colors '=(#b) #([0-9]#)*=0=01;31'
[snap]

This only works, if you also setopt extendedglob. If you do not want
that option set this way of coloring the completion list will not
work.

Would it be possible to silently set extendedglob for all style
evaluations (similar to the fact, that it is set in all completion
functions by default)?

Regards, Frank
