} Where zsh really violates POSIX:

Of course, a*b and a**b do have identical functionality.  ** only becomes
special when it has a slash after it.  I suppose SH_GLOB could disable it.

} Another point is using collating elements, ranges etc ... anything that
} has to deal with locale.

I've lost track of what happened to the strcoll() situation since PWS's
regex-like implementation of globbing was put in.  There used to be #if 0
code in glob.c (as of workers/7185) but it has completely disappeared.
