Anyone notice that the zshwiki (http://www.zshwiki.org/ )  has been
hit with a lot of link spam (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog_spam). 
  It would be nice if the owner took some anti-spam measures.

OT: Are there any good anti-spam measures that can be taken?

Also, are there any wiki platforms that are better at spam prevention
or clean up?
I like the idea of having the zshwiki, but would like to see it sit on
another wiki platform.  There are a quite a few out there, some with
more formatting control.  In particular I would like to see one that
had table support.

-FR.

ps the wiki is mentiioned in Oliver&Peter's new zsh book.  the book
looks interesting so far, writing style is nice.  is intended for the
beginning to intermediate users and covers both bash and zsh.
