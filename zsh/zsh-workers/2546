Hi!

I compiled 3.0.2-test1 (by first unpacking a 'fresh' 3.0.1 then doing
the big patch. The first 'hunk' in Etc/FAQ failed (I saw nothing which
'should' brak it, so may be there are some blanks or tabs ?)
The rest worked normally, even the OPEN_MAX did NOT need to be changed
(We needed it =64, an in 3.0.2 it seems to be default now).

Just now I started zsh-3.0.2-test1 on an terminal with 'dumb' $TERM
setting, so 'SINGLE-LINE-ZLE' was on. (The error does not depend on that,
it happens on every TERM, wherever '-M' is on.)

The result of switching '-M' on is:
- deleting 'backwards' the last char, just moves left
- deleting a char 'inside' the linne, moves the following chars left,
  BUT 'fills' with the last char (also does no 'blanking' of the last char)
- Control-U (erase line) only moves the cursor to the beginning of line
- Control-K (erase rest of line) does seemingly nothing

All the above do 'realize' the correct line, they only display wrongly.

Your's  Stucki
