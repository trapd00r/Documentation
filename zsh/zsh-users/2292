Great question, as I am in a very similar situation as to the number of
accounts and OSes (4 OSes, and numberous accounts).  I've been thinking
for a long time about doing it over cvs since I do cvs for development,
however, cvs is not installed on most of these systems (I guess I should do
it being I admin these boxes :)  But I would like to hear about how other
people do similar things.  This also pertains to other .files as well.
