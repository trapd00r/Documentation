I should clarify my problem.  It works fine in
windows, and I run rxvt like so:
"C:\cygwin\bin\rxvt.exe -tn rxvt-cygwin-native -e zsh
--login -i".

However when I ssh into a Linux box, the
'rxvt-cygwin-native' descriptor is only in $TERMINFO,
and I can't get ZSH to look in there to get it.  I set
$TERMINFO in ~/.zshenv, so it might be too late.  I
don't know how I can tell ssh to set it before loading
Zsh...
