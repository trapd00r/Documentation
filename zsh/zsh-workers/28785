OK.  I applied both patches.  So far as I can tell it all works on
freebsd.

  $ setopt shglob
  
  $ if !(echo hello); then echo "XXXX"; fi
  hello
  
  $ while(true)do(pwd)done
  /home/vince/src
  /home/vince/src
  /home/vince/src
  ...
  ^C
  
  $ /usr/bin/zsh -c 'exec </nonexistent/a; echo wrong'
  zsh:1: no such file or directory: /nonexistent/a
  wrong
  
  $ /usr/bin/zsh -c 'emulate sh; exec </nonexistent/a; echo wrong'
  zsh:1: no such file or directory: /nonexistent/a
  
Although, I am a little unclear about this last one.  Since it is
a redirection error of a built in function, shouldn't it exit, even if
it is not emulating another shell?
