Err, itself, right?

That was a hint... (I still wonder why I can't reproduce it, though).

I hope this fixes it. It's the only place where a parent shell sends a 
SIGSTOP and, yes, it's good to have that extra test there -- it means
roughly that we don't need to suspend the beginning of a pipeline if
there is no such beginning -- exactly what happens when suspending a
function.
