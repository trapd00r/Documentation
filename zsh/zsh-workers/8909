It's not too bad.  These pathnames are already variable.

The purpose of program name transformations is to avoid clashes with
other programs of the same name.  In the case of zsh, this is only likely
to be a clash with another installation of zsh, but it's still a need.
(For example, one of the places where I used to install zsh regularly
is now required to avoid clashes with the names of system-installed
programs -- including the system's zsh 2.4 installation.)  The clash can
apply to lib directories just as it can to binary names, where there are
multiple installations with the same pathname prefix.  We really should
apply the transform to *all* installed filenames.
