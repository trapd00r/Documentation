Well, sure enough fpath did not contain that directory. It still
contained directory for the old version. But I don't set fpath anywhere
explicetely. Neither in zshenv, nor in zshrc. Hm. Looks like I made the
problem for myself. When I was updating the system, there was one
terminal window with zsh running. I guess, because of that, the zsh
binary itself was not updated. Reinstallation of the package solved all
of the problems.
