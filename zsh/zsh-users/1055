Hello:
	 I have a ftp problem: When I use ftp to a zhs-user it appears the message:  
 530 User xxxxx access denied
Login failed.
and I can not reach the user. It does not matter if the origin-user is csh or zsh, but if the destination is zsh-user the problem always appears.
	Other annoyance is with the 'man', not all the commands are available
for the 'man'  from the zhsell (v.g. f77 has not man page form zhsell, in cshell yes).
Could you help me. Thanks,
				Andres Gomez
