Hi all,

I'm still here - just taking it easy on the computer front at the
moment, as it was sapping too much of my time.  I'm having problems
compiling the latest CVS tree:

  make[2]: Entering directory `/mnt/hda7/opt/zsh/Src'
  gcc -c -I. -D_LARGEFILE_SOURCE -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -Wall -Wno-implicit -Wmissing-prototypes -O2  -o builtin.o builtin.c
  In file included from zsh.mdh:26,
                   from builtin.c:30:
  exec.epro:25: `RLIM_NLIMITS' undeclared here (not in a function)
  exec.epro:26: `RLIM_NLIMITS' undeclared here (not in a function)
  make[2]: *** [builtin.o] Error 1
  make[2]: Leaving directory `/mnt/hda7/opt/zsh/Src'
  make[1]: *** [modobjs] Error 2
  make[1]: Leaving directory `/mnt/hda7/opt/zsh/Src'
  make: *** [all] Error 1

Not sure whether I'm being stupid or just rusty, but I can't figure
out where @RLIMITS_INC_H@ is supposed to get #included for this (if
indeed it is @RLIMITS_INC_H@ - maybe I even got that wrong).
config.status has:

  s%@RLIMITS_INC_H@%/usr/include/asm/resource.h%g

which looks right to me.
