Please, when sending bug reports, can people say explicitly what's actually
going wrong and what they're doing to provoke it.  I think you mean that
when you move the cursor backward it miscounts the character it's on,
but I had to guess that from the throwaway remark at the end.

So that actually displays as zero width on your terminal?  (I'm having to
guess this, too.)  Yes, that's bound to cause the shell problems.  In fact,
it's going to be quite impossible to edit: how do you even know it's there?
On gnome-terminal, which I'm using, it shows up as as a thick underscore
which is counted as width 1, and this works.  However, I can certainly see
problems in Konsole.  So this is apparently terminal-specific.
