This is as it should be.  If someone searches for "ls ", he doesn't
want to see just "ls".  In fact, even if you're searching for the
prefix "ls" (w/o space), the code skips a line of just "ls" as
a useless match (the only exception to that is that it will allow
the match if we are returning to the "curhist" line at the end of
the history).

> It also means that a line beginning with "ls	" (tab) won't match.

Yes.  It would be nice to fix this, but this is almost never a
problem in actual practice since most people don't input tabs into
their command lines.  Your suggestion for adding a word-boundary
option to metadiffer() sounds like the right solution.
