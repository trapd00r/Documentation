Subject: Weird yodl thing in files.yo
MIME-version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

The yodl source is this:

Commands are first read from tt(zshenv()); this cannot be overridden.

What I get in my compiled documentation is this:

Commands are first read from no; this cannot be overridden.

Er, what?

Doc/version.yo:def(zshenv)(0)(no)

This must be because I configure my devel build with global RC files
disabled?
