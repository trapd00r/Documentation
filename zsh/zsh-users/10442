Hmmm... I'm beginning to understand something is occurring behind the  
scenes here... the *NIX /login/ utility.

So, when I open a new terminal window, with /insert favorite terminal  
application here/, the /login/ utility is invoked and I get a *login*  
shell, this is *interactive*. Following that, I request a new shell  
at the command line, barring the /-l/ switch, I get a new, but / 
interactive/ shell:

% ssh luser@box
Password:
[luser@box] ~% setopt
...
interactive
login
...
[luser@box] ~% zsh
[luser@box] ~% setopt
...
interactive
...

Am I on the right path here?

Thanks,
Tim
