Hi

I have the following rule

compctl -k "(vim perl32 dbi xml xsl lists mutt-dev mutt-users vim flexfax hyla)"  -P " -f /home/eric/Mail/" mutt

This works file except that it does not allow tabbing completing outside
of the values specified in the array.

Is it possible to allow these options and then any other option in the
same rule?

thanx

If I had a sig it would be fun.
 The quest for the Holy Sig has begun.
 I have not yet a clue,
 What will you see next issue?
