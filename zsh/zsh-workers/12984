} Ah, right, this does. Hm, but when I think about this alternate-set
} stuff it comes from: doesn't it may make sense to add all the ignored
} matches? At least than all corrections.

It may make sense to add all the ignored matches, but not in the same
single completion where one adds all the not-ignored matches.  Is there
some way to get all the ignored matches added only if there aren't any
that are not ignored?  Can one use _all_matches more than once in the
list of completers, e.g. both before and after _ignored?
