Hi all,=20

As my pure zsh written libs is growing, i would like to add some
documentations and unit tests. I wrote a little perl script in few
minutes to do that but I would like something better.

I don't want write anything more if an existing solution exists. Does
someone knows about it?=20

Regards
mc
