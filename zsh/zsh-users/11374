Background: Emacs version 23 will soon (looks like) to released.
            Pre-released versions are already being used (in fact to write this).

The international "MULE" functionality was also added after 18.  

I recommend the change. It's not a major change, but would reflect the current emacs method, which presumably the majority of emacs users expect.  This might also save a lot of zsh new comers, who are not familiar with customizing yet, time and confusion
.

My 2 cents.
