I agree with Bart here in some respects.

How easy is it to package up modules separately in such a way that they
could be built and installed without needing to be unpacked over the zsh
source and compiled with it. Ideally, we would have a set of include
files which was all anyone needed to build a separate zsh module.

Does anyone remember what happened to the perl module someone posted
quite a while back?

I was going to moan about the name (pcre) because it isn't obvious what
it stands for but as it is the name of the library it uses, I suppose
I'll have to put up with it.
