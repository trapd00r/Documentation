More precisely, you were told that Andrej does that.

Andrej probably wasn't expecting you to use it verbatim, though, because
he didn't show you what his settings for the matcher-list style are.  You
didn't say whether you have any settings for matcher-list; if you don't,
the _match completer won't do anything.

} I want behavior more like what expand-or-complete does except that I
} want only what the completion system would return to be substituted.

That's what the _expand completer is for.  I believe you want:

zstyle ':completion:*' completer _oldlist _expand _complete _match
zstyle ':completion::expand:*' completions true

And maybe you don't even need the _match on the end, if you haven't
worked out any matcher-list values yet.  The _match completer is for
doing things like case-insensitive completion and completion of sub-
parts of file names (e.g., completing on both sides of a ".").

You probably also want to read about the following styles:

    accept-exact
    add-space
    completions
    glob
    keep-prefix
    sort
    subst-globs-only
    substitute
    suffix
