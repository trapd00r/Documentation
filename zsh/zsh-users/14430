Do you see this problem anywhere except in "set -x" output?
Because "set -x" output is known to be a bit different from what you
actually typed. You don't need your complex program to check it - you
can try set -x interactively:

$ echo "hi there"
+zsh:1> echo 'hi there'
hi there
/home/nyh$ echo hi\ there
+zsh:2> echo 'hi there'
hi there

Note how any kind of quoting is turned into a single quote on set -x's
output. Why does this bother you? (Or maybe I'm misunderstanding what
bothered you).
