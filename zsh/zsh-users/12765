Hello, I'm using zsh 4.3.4 (the one packaged in Fedora 8) and having a
strange behavior: the prompt is evaluated three times when I think it
should be just one.

An example: opened up two terminals, in one I did:

   touch a; tail -f a

in the other, in zsh:

   setopt prompt_subst
   PROMPT='lala$(echo X >> a)'

everytime I press ENTER in the second terminal, three new Xs appear, I
was expecting one. Is it expected? Am I missing something?


Cheers,
  Caio Marcelo
