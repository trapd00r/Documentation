This is the approach some programs use (e.g. elm), and some not
(Perl, Emacs[1]).  It is simply a matter of choice; I like the choice
zsh developers made.

I don't see anything wrong with the "old-fashioned" help currently
used.  Before thinking about converting to something different, one
should think about all the advantages of PDF over TexInfo?  Is there a
freely available viewer for PDF files?  Can they be viewed on a text
terminal?
