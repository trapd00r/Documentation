I think it would be better to modify the code which uses the end-of-string
marks. I do not like new ztrdups. Also it requires some additional CPU time as
well (malloc can be quite slow, especially with zsh-mem, which queues signals
befor each malloc). The proper solution shouldn't be too difficult, be I have
some other things to do now.
