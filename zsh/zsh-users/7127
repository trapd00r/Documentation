Mac OS X has the same problem -- mixtures of case-sensitive and
case-insensitive filesystems all at once.

Note that this varies between SysV and BSD systems, at least (cf.
getmntent vs statfs).

Also: HFS ?

Also, what about the following phenomenon (which is not usual amongst
shells) -- is it the same under Cygwin?

% mkdir blah
% cp -p =date blah/DATE
% export PATH=$PWD/blah:$PATH
% ls /tmp/blah
DATE
% rehash
% where date
/tmp/blah/date
/bin/date

(not /tmp/blah/DATE) In this case, /tmp is on an HFS volume. Of course,
it might be different if /tmp/blah were on a UFS volume. Might be
awkward to calculate all this.
