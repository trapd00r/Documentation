Subject: PATCH: 3.1.6-pws-2: _gv
Date: Wed, 01 Sep 1999 16:46:37 +0200
From: Peter Stephenson <pws@ibmth.df.unipi.it>

Some typos crept into _gv (at least the one I have, which is the one you
get).

Also, completion for configure failed when I used it via a path beginning
with a ~.  Apparently something (_arguments, presumably) tried to append
the current directory to the path, which didn't work awfully well.

(By the way, Sven, now I've thought of it: when you generate new completion
functions, could you use a directory name like Completion with a suffix
rather than oc for the old directory, since patch -p0 prefers the shorter
name and creates it in oc.  If you want to avoid having to type the whole
of Completion..., I believe there are now shells which can help in this
respect...)
