Run this:

bindkey -R ' -~' .self-insert

Then try to use execute-named-cmd.

To get back to normal, re-execute the bindkey with the leading dot removed
from the widget name.

There are probably other widgets that simulate a minibuffer that have the
same problem, but I haven't tried to identify them as yet.
