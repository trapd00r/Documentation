Documentation in the source directory is needed to create distribution
tarball. If you change it you need to change also all scripts that are
involved.

I guess ithos issue came up before already. Actually, I found it useful
- when building on Cygwin off Unix source dir I did not need any tool
(like yodl) because docs were always up-to-date.
