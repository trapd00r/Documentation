Hello Peter !

It's good to see that someone is still working on inproving
zsh. I'm using this opportunity to report a nasty bug
that is annoying me for almost two years now (I had posted
that to zsh-workers a year ago, but without response).

zsh badly hangs if file globbing fails in connection
with completion. Please try the following with
any zsh 3.x version (including 3.1.5-pws-19) and
enter "foo [tab]":

  compctl -s "\$(cat [tT]his-file-does-not-exist)" foo
 
thanks,
Markus
