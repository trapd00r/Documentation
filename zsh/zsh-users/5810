Rewrite zle to make the constant KRINGCT dynamic.  This looks a fairly
easy project, and (in 4.1) there's already an interface for changing the
size via the new $killring zle parameter.  I may do this if I get bored
and no-one else does it first.

The one gotcha I can see is you would have to rely on any function
setting $killring to limit the length itself.  However, as far as I
know, at the moment there aren't any.
