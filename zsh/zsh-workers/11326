} That's caused by the `exec </dev/null' Bart added. No idea what's
} happening here yet... (it's too darn hot here for thinking).

During `exec', init_io() reinitializes SHTTY from descriptor 1, stomping
on the tty settings in the process.

The following is the most obvious fix, but maybe there's a better way?
It bothers me a little that zleactive isn't isolated to the zle module,
but there are other bits of the main zsh code that know about it.
