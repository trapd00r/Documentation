It took me a while to work out what you were saying, but I think it's that
while `blah1 blah2' used to be tried one after another when they were
elements of $compmatchers, they get tried all at once if they are elements
of the matcher style in the form I gave it.  If that's correct, I doubt if
that's a major issue for most users --- I suspect that most people who used
more than one element of $compmatchers just had different things in them,
as I did.

Still, how much do you gain by being able to put them in matcher-1 and
matcher-2?  Is that more powerful than just using array elements of the
style in order, rather than simply more cumbersome?  The only examples I
can think of where you gain something are where _matcher is followed the
second time by _prefix instead of _complete (or vice versa), or where some
other element of the context is different between the matcher-1 and
matcher-2 cases.  These seem to me to be to abstruse to be useful.  But I
may well have missed something.
