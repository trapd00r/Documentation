I was using Oliver's version of most-recent-file, which works as
follows (see zsh-users/6957, for example):

  zstyle ':completion:most-recent-file:*' match-original both
  zstyle ':completion:most-recent-file::::' completer _menu _files _match
  zstyle ':completion:most-recent-file:*' file-sort modification
  zstyle ':completion:most-recent-file:*' file-patterns '*(.):normal\ files'
  zstyle ':completion:most-recent-file:*' hidden all
  bindkey '^X.' most-recent-file
  zle -C most-recent-file menu-complete _generic

It allows you to cycle through the most recent matches in order.  I
found that this doesn't work with the _oldlist completer.  _oldlist
works the first time, preserving the list of matches, but on the second
TAB decides to generate a new list.  This appears to be because
_main_completer squirrels away compstate[nmatches] regardless of
_oldlist; the value is 0 after the first use of _oldlist because we
didn't generate any matches this time.  (I say "appears" because
although it certainly does do what I said it's possible there's
something deeper going on.)

If I've identified the real symptom and not a side effect, the following
patch will fix it.  I can well believe it's more involved, however.

It's offset a couple of lines because of my two-line change to give
progress reports on completion, which I'm happily using but no one else
liked.
