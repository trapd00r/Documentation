That reminds me. Why cannot we
have --enable-dynamic-modules/--enable-static-modules in configure? That is
really better as having separate file that needs to be edited by hand.

It should be removed by distclean in any case. That is exactly the point,
why configure argument is much better. You could the have a standard
config.zsh, that runs configure with all desired options.
