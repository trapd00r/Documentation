That's general question - how far is compatibility with current Unix
standards important? For better or for worse - current behaviour is one
of the requirements. The problem is (I can go into more details if
needed) Zsh in current form does not and *can* not support full i18n as
specified in docs (this applies to such obscure things as "collate
elements" e.g.). So, the ultimate question is - should we aim at full
POSIX/SUS/... compatibility, at least as an option (that may need
substantial rewrite), or drop it in favour of more "user friendliness".

Now, with much more powerful regular expressions, I even agree - for
interactive shell plain ASCII collating may be more appropriate - and
scripts should use [[:class:]] form anyway.
