Why would it be a zsh bug if it builds fine outside of sbuild?
Why would it be an sbuild bug if it builds fine under sbuild on all
architectures bug sparc and amd64?

Perhaps.  That situation also involves zsh, perl, and weird signal
problems.

> Anyway, 4.2.0-dev-1+20040504-1 didn't have the problem at all.

The zsh-beta package doesn't run "make check", so the problem wouldn't
be observed.
