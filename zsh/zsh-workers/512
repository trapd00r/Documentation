I think that the problem is that you should use the extended_history option to
get meaningful timestamps.  Be default zsh does not save time information into
the history file and on the next login eralier commands are listed with the
time of the latest login.

>From zshoptions(1):

              EXTENDED_HISTORY
                     Save  beginning and ending timestamps to the
                     history file.  The format  of  these  times-
                     tamps     is    :<beginning    time>:<ending
                     time>:<command>.
