:I noticed it too. It should not be OS restriction, since it works in other

The limitation is imposed by the OS.  You can usually find it in 
/usr/include/sys/syslimits.h  as something like ARG_MAX (256Kb on my machine)
According to POSIX: "The number of bytes available for the combined
argument list and environment list is given by ARG_MAX macro in <limits.h>"

Look through the /usr/include/**/*limit* files or try something like:  
% fgrep ARG_ /usr/include/**/*.h

Zoltan mentioned that the builtin echo wasn't limited thus, so maybe you 
could do
% echo ~/.netscape-cache/* | xargs rm
or maybe this will work if there aren't too many
% (cd ~/.netscape-cache; echo *)
