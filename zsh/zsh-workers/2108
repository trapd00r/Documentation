Hi! (again :-)

I have another very spcific question...

I would like to have a zsh-function behave different if called
inside $(...) or backticks !
Exactly, I want to have the function 'chpwd' give some output
if triggered by 'cd' or 'chdir' BUT TO GIVE NO OUTPUT
if triggered by cases like  '... $(cd somewhere; ls)...' 

Might that be possible ?

Clueless (again),  Stucki
