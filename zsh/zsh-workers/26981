One thing, the rest of VCS_INFO_get_data_git() uses four spaces for
indenting and the patch mixes tabs into that.

Also when introducing a new style, a documentation update would be
nice. :)

Apart from that, technically the patch itself looks fine, IMO.
However, I don't use stgit myself, so I can't give it a test drive.
