It also doesn't know whether or not you want error checking.

Use a wrapper.  It's not 100% accurate in guessing what form of cd you
are using, but it will work the vast majority of the time.

cd() {
  local -a dirs
  local d
  for d in $*; do
    [[ -d $d ]] && dirs=($dirs $d)
  done
  if (( ${#dirs} == 1 )); then
    builtin cd $dirs
  else
    # Assume it's something like e.g. `cd SOURCE REPLACE'
    builtin cd "$@"
  fi
}
