I have zsh 3.1.6 installed, but I don't have the promptinit function in
my distrib.  Does that mean, then, that there are different versions of
3.1.6?  How do I know which 3.1.6 is the newest in that case?

In the mean time, I tried putting something like this in my ~/.zshrc file:

fg_black="$(echo -n '\e[1;30m')"
fg_green="$(echo -n '\e[0;32m')"
fg_brown="$(echo -n '\e[0;33m')"
fg_grey="$(echo -n '\e[0;37m')"
PS1="${fg_black}[${fg_green}%W %T${fg_black}] \
        ${fg_brown}%m${fg_black}:${fg_brown}%l \
	${fg_black}:${fg_brown}%~${fg_grey}%# "

(that's all on one line)

Which makes my prompt look exactly the way I want it.  However, this
seems to disturb cursor positioning for doing completions with tab and
also browsing the command history with the arrow keys.  For instance, if
I'm trying to complete the filename of a file to edit, and I hit tab,
half of my commandline might dissapear (including some of the prompt) --
note that if I ignore the aesthetics, the functionality is still the
same.

Any ideas?

Sorry, won't happen again!

Thanks,
Matt
