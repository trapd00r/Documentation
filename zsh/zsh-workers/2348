Zsh has been using tabs since 2.5 - the change now is not to use them if they
are destructive.  There have been a few things I would have liked to make
options for, but people haven't wanted too many setopt's so I've avoided them.

One is for using tabs.
Another is scrolling of the screen, which is now linked to BAUD.
I can't think of the others at the moment, but they were probably linked to
automargin stuff.
