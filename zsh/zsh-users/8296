Isn't this the same problem as a finding a quoted string?  In this
case it has to follow a variable name within braces...  Though maybe I
don't understand.

Also the here-strings formatting ( which is different from here-docs
<<) is  wrong: cat <<<"This is a here string" should highlight the
string somehow. not just the first word.   It seems confused by the
syntax, because of the closing ".

It's up to you about some well-known functions.  

It would be useful if there was a file or set of files that
demonstrate syntactic features of zsh that could be used as a test
case for the syntax highlighting.
