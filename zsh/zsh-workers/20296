(There must be a set -x or setopt xtrace lurking somewhere.)

It's not actually lost, it's showing you the line in the eval.  That's
a feature (compare error messages from Perl evals, which is where we
pinched the output format from).

What are you trying to do?  You can record the line number outside if
you need it, e.g.

lineno=LINENO; eval 'print $lineno'

I take it the complaint isn't about the debugging output from xtrace
this time, since that shows the line number of the eval command (5).
