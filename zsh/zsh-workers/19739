Thanks, I've committed this apart from the texi2html hunk.

It's possible opening all files in text mode will cause problems
elsewhere, e.g. on file descriptors passed to external programmes, but
the text/binary problem is inescapable; we probably need to wait and
see.  We can always invent grotesqueries like <#myfile.bin if it becomes
necessary.
