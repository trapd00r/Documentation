Sounds like you need to read zshcompsys for some orientation.  (I don't
mean to claim that's necessarily as enlightening as you might wish.)

As I said before, the names on the left are the tags.  What I didn't say
was the names in parentheses are the functions implementing completion
for those tags.  This gives you a hint about what the tags are used for.

_alternative is a utility function and we should probably suppress it
from the list since it doesn't generate its own completions (I think
that's easy to do but I haven't looked at the code).

There's no precedence until you use tag-order as I described before.
The lines are simply to associate tags with different completers.

Instead of putting '*' in the last value in tag-order, just put
in named-directories, giving

zstyle ':completion:*:complete:(cd|pushd):*' tag-order \
  'local-directories path-directories directory-stack' 'named-directories'

This time I've added pushd explicitly.  Note that it is harmless to add
tags which the completer in question doesn't actually use.
