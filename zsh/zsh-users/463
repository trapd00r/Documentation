Sorry, this one is obviously wrong.  READNULLCMD should be unset (or
empty) by default.  Then, if READNULLCMD is empty, zsh should use

is found in READNULLCMD.  How does that sound?

Contrary to popular belief, Unix is user friendly.  
It just happens to be selective about who it makes friends with.
