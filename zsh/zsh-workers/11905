I think it was my suggestion, at least I suggested modifying the defaults
for _expand_word to work the way I expected (which was basically how ^x*
works), and it was simply to avoid having to impact on people who were
happily using _expand.  But if they prefer it to work by default the way
_expand_word was modified to, I'm all the happier.  (I can't parse the
first part of that last sentence any more, so it'll have to do how it is.)
