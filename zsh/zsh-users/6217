I respectfully submit that it's time to revisit the "you must be subscribed
to post" issue.  I know it's been ruled out before, but things have changed
since then, and not for the better.

I contacted sunsite.dk people about the recent virus problem and
received this in reply:

Hopefully that helps. I'm increasingly thinking that qconfirm, at least
for the users list would be a good idea. Especially if we get another
virus outbreak like this one.

Since I was e-mailing them anyway, I also enquired about CVS hosting
(problems with CVS currently being discussed on -workers). Response
on that issue was:

So with the daily snapshots not being a problem, that could be a good
option. Perhaps if we wait till sunsite have the new hardware and if SF
still has issues then, we can switch. Sound okay?
