Hmm, I failed to notice that this Debian bug was talking about the _make
completer.  It looks to me like the main problem is that the script has
a reference to $1 in some $(shell ...) expansions, and the _make script
is expanding this into the arg that is being expanded, causing an
infinite loop.  So, I think it would be good to work up a patch that
would cause the _make script to avoid trying to expand (or set) numeric
arg variables (I'll look into this).

However, the patch you cited that limits recursion-depth also appears to
be a reasonable precaution to avoid a problem like this in the future.
It looks good enough to check-in to me -- if you agree, feel free (or
ask me to do so).
