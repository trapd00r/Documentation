Sure, but - if the zsh has to do globbing anyway
then why not have it looks at the files, too?

As there is a GLOBBING modifier for "size" then I suspect
there must be a nice way to extract the size of files somehow.
Would be nice if there was an easy way to get the sum
without writing an explicit loop for this, too.

I am trying not to ask for a built-in replacement
for gls here - but then again, I wouldn't mind.  ;-)
