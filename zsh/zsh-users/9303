    Which is not. I mean, it is if I use the eval solution (which, as
I told Wayne, I had tested before without success, probably a typo.
Oh, no, examining my history, the problem was the missing 'q' flag,
that's all).

    A typo, my fault O:)

    This is a bit difficult because it forces me to change the way
that the command line is parsed. I mean, the script gets a globbing
pattern or a list of files to process (and produces another list),
and if one of the parameters is a command, I must think about a way
of separating it from the list of files. Something like:

    myscript -c "du -s" files...

    Not much difficult (the script already uses 'getopts') but a bit
messy if I must pass parameters with spaces in them in the command.
It's much easier to use eval, then. Obviously I can use zargs as a
model (using "-- command args"). I think that it could be the way...

    Do you mean something like this?:

    IFS=$'\0' du -s `myscript`

    Because it doesn't work, neither (nor exporting IFS with NULL as
its value, zsh still splits on spaces).

    I'm thinking about another solution that could be better, since
sometimes I want to manually review the list before passing it to the
command (and the scripts generates a *different* list each time is
called):

    array=(`myscript args`)

    and making 'myscript' to do a simple 'print -l'. Obviously, the
problem is more or less the same, I need 'eval' or something like
that. Could I do the above, using 'print -N', and after that forcing
the split in NULLs? I've tested this (doesn't work):

    array=(`print -N -- $list`)
    print -l ${(s:$'\0':)array}

    I can use 'eval', of course:

    eval array=\(`print -r -- ${(q)list}`\)

    But it is even more messy to write than using the command itself,
so...  Obviously I'm missing a lot of things here :( but this is the
perfect solution (using an array, I mean) because that allows me to
review the generated list and using it afterwards for more than one
command (which I do frequently, so it will be better than just do
something like "eval command `myscript`"). Any way of doing this
without much mess?

    Thanks a lot for all the help and teaching you're providing :)
