Hm, the simple test:

  _values test 'a:arg:->foo' b c

  if [[ -n $state ]]; then compadd foo bar; fi

works for me.  How does this fail for you?

I always think of computil as something too deeply hidden for ca. 99
percent of all users and programmers.  And most of those builtins are
useful only for the functions for which they were invented, so that
documenting them doesn't make much sense unless people would want their
own versions of _arguments and _values which behave the same as the
originals.  Maybe we should put some more comments in those functions.
