Hello!

System of completion in zsh is very powerful and very addictive :) The
more painful it is, when it fails for some reason. I was very impressed
with completions for gnu arch commands. And now I'm trying out darcs,
but seems like here completion is not so good. I'd rather say it hinders
me instead of helping. The very first thing I try to do is to add a
file. So I do 'darcs add f<Tab>'. All I get in response is "Completing
`arg for darcs command'". No file name. So I have use copy/paste to get
file names into command line.

What could be the problem here? Any solutions?
