Ah, you want Tom Phelp's TkMan, which shows when there are multiple
manpages with the same name, and provides a menu of them.

"typeset -U" works for arrays, and so works for path.  Unfortunately,
it doesn't work with (for example) LD_LIBRARY_PATH, which is a
colon-separated list.  Annoying: this really needs configurableness.
