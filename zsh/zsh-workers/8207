I cannot apply this patch. It creates lots of files in top-level directory. Even
with Tanaka's --use-index-line patch for patch. This is consistent - in
non-POSIX mode patch selects file name with the least number of slashes. And in
POSIX mode it won't create files.

There are more and more people using CVS on this list ... may be, we should come
up with a single patch format? This includes -p0/-p1 problem as well :-)
