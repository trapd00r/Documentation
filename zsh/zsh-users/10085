Indeed I didn't read the OLDPWD entry. Thanks for pointing it out.

I don't expect anything, except for the prompt, to automatically change
after an "export" without issuing any other command. (Whether that's
actually the case is beyond the point here.) I didn't expect this for
PWD nor for OLDPWD.

But I did expect "cd -" to change to the value of OLDPWD.

How did I come up with such a crazy, nonsensical idea?

By reading the manual, which *explicitly* states that this would
happen. No more, no less.

Honestly, I'm sure it would.

Because it was the particular wording at the "cd" entry that got me into
trying to use the *value* of OLDPWD to influence "cd -".

IMHO this is not the case of being "marginally clearer" but about being
"technically accurate".
