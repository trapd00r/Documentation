I've uploaded version 4.2.2 to ftp.zsh.org.  Please try it out on as
many systems as possible before I upload it to Sourceforge and announce
it on Freshmeat.  It would be especially good if someone could confirm
that there are now no problems on Cygwin.

There are lots of bug fixes and completion enhancements since 4.2.1,
only a few minor new features.
