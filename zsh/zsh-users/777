...and yet bash-2.01 will have a fix.  I fixed the bash parsing code
so that it requires an arithmetic command to begin with `((', end
with `))', and have an equal number of open and close parens.  If it
does not end with `))', it is treated as a nested subshell.  A non-
balancing number of open and close parens is treated as a syntax error.
