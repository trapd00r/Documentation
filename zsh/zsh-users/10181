Thank you. This ambiguity would not be a problem in my case. Just out of
curiosity:

[OT] How exact are time stamps on files? If, basically, a time_t value
is choosen
for a time stamp, then in practice the only possibility for two files to
come
up with the same time stamp, is when the time stamp is explicitly
supplied
via "touch", isn't it?
