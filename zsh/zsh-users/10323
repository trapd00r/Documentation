Sorry, I misunderstood what vi-history-search-forward, etc, does.

         bindkey -v
         bindkey '\e[A'  history-search-backward
         bindkey '\e[B'  history-search-forward

gives me the desired behavior.


Thanks for pointing out what should have been obvious.  (I just issued
bindkey -v on the command line to experiment. I'm not sure what it says
about the ossified state of my brain, but even as a vi(m) user, I can't
seem to break the emacs keybinding habbits in the shell. It was far easier
to switch from tcsh to zsh. I'll give it the weekend.)
