Subject: completion matching problem with 4.3.8
Date: Thu, 30 Oct 2008 12:28:50 +0100
Message-ID: <24068.1225366130@thecus>
X-Virus-Scanned: ClamAV 0.92.1/8541/Thu Oct 30 03:54:28 2008 on bifrost
X-Virus-Status: Clean

There seems to be a problem with matching control.

touch PacketDefinitionSAXHandler.h PacketListBox.cpp PacketListBox.h PacketsDialog.h
zsh -f
autoload -U compinit; compinit
zstyle ':completion:*' matcher-list 'm:{a-z}={A-Z}'
: P<tab>
  --> Completes to 'Packets' instead of just 'Packet'
