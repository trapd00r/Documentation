I now checked this also on our solaris systems. The situation is that both
insert-composed-char and insert-unicode-char fail, on the line which tries to
print a unicode esacep sequence. However, on these machines, I get
'zsh: cannot do charset conversion' on such print commands (e.g., print
\\u21 , which should print a bang!), a message which is generated by
Src/utils.c. I am using a LC_CTYPE=en_US.UTF-8 locale, and zsh in configured
with --enable-multibyte (which is a mistary by itself, since on my RedHat
system, this flag is not needed since configure figures it out by itself).
