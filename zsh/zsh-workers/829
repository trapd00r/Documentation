Yes, these pages are very nice.  Using them as a base for changes
to the zsh web pages is a good idea.

I have looked at pod (and SGML, and other things) several times.
One of the things I don't like about pod, is that you can't put
things like boldface/italics in code examples.  The zsh pages uses
this quite a bit.

I agree that nroff is terrible.  I've been thinking maybe it's time
to scrap man pages altogether.  Put all the documentation into a
latex file, and create a nice zsh manual.
