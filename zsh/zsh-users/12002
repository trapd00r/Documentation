Hi,                                                                        =

I don't have the solution, but a workaround: when using man -l, completion =
shows                                                            =20
filenames:                                                                 =
                                                                 =20
                                                                           =
                                                                 =20
man -l ./<TAB>                                                             =
                                                                 =20
                                                                           =
                                                                 =20
According to man manual, man -l is the right way open a file, and:         =
                                                                 =20
                                                                           =
                                                                 =20

> using the name as a filename and looking for an exact match.             =
                                                                 =20
                                                                           =

So, zsh completion behaviour seems quite coherent to me.                   =
                                                                 =20
                                                                           =
                                                                 =20
