Yes, using a parameter for this was what I thought about, too.

I'd like to remove that parameter anyway: let `init' accept an options 
(-d or so) to enable auto-dumping. It's used only in `init'
anyway. And while I'm at it: I'd like to make `dump' write into a file 
automatically (let it use COMPDUMP, too, with the usual default), so
that it is even easier to make dumps in-between (once we have changed
the example code so that this is possible).

Bye
 Sven
