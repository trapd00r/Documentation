Hello,

I built zsh version 4.0.6 on Solaris 2.6 for use on 2.6 through 2.8. 
However, executable only works on Solaris 2.8.  On 2.6, it can't find
/usr/lib/libcurses.so.1 so it bails.  On 2.7, it exits silently (no
messages) with an exit status of 1.

So is anyone running version 4.0.x successfully on Solaris 2.6 or 2.7?

Thanks,
-Bill
