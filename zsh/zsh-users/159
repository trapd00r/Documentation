I use zsh as the root login on both Linux, SunOS, and Solaris.  I haven't run
into any problems that I can trace directly to zsh.  Sun once complained that
what I was doing was "non-standard," but since we've seen no side-effects, no
one seemed to care.

I don't use zsh as sh at all.  I figure that if a shell script has #!/bin/sh
in it, I should give it what it wants.  Of course, none of *my* scripts use
sh...!

Hope this helps!
