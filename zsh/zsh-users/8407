Perfect. It works :) On the note of completion. I've noticed that now
when I say 'scp host:/path/files/* .' zsh complains that there were no
matches found. To work around this I had to put quotes around the
host:/path/files/*. I've tried to use 

zstyle ':completion:*' preserve-prefix '(//[^/]##/|[^:/]##:)'

bur for some reason it didn't help. So I guess this style is not the
right one :) What would be the right action (beside putting it in
quotes?)
