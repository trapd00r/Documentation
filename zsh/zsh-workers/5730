Hi,

I have the following problem with zsh (currently pws-11) but the problems
seems to be older.

At the system console of my IRIX (6.5) box (running X11)
I have say the following lines in one window


------------
cat  <<\EOD

# Special Formats (HJ)
ETeX    etex   language.def  *ETeX.ini
ETeXe   etex   language.def  *ETeXe.ini
PTeXe   etex   language.def  *PTeXe.ini
PTeX    etex   language.def  *PTeX.ini
EOD
-----------


If I select this text and paste it into an xterm window running zsh, I get
103 % cat  <<\EOD
 *ETeX.ini
ETeXe   etex   language.def  *ETeXe.ini
heredoc>

heredoc> # Special Formats (HJ)

heredoc> ETeXe   etex   language.def  *ETeXe.ini
heredoc>   language.def  *PTeXe.ini
heredoc> PTeX    etex   language.def  *PTeX.ini
heredoc> EOD

# Special Formats (HJ)
ETeX    etex   language.def PTeXe   etex  *ETeX.ini
ETeXe   etex   language.def  *ETeXe.ini
  language.def  *PTeXe.ini
PTeX    etex   language.def  *PTeX.ini


Can anyone help me?
(This does NOT happen if a different shell like bourne-shell is running
 in that xterm )

Thanks,
Helmut.
