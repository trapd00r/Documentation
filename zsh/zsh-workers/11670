Looks like your configure, or maybe just your config.status, aren't up to
date.  configure should contain this line:

s%@EXEEXT@%$EXEEXT%g

and config.status should contain this line everywhere except where an
executable extension is actually required:

s%@EXEEXT@%%g

as input to sed.  If they are, try re-running config.status.
