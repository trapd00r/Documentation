} cursor-wrap-around suggested by Bart, which seemed even more sensible
} after thinking about it. The only irritating effect is that moving
} left when at the top-left match wraps you around to the bottom-right
} match. Is that how pine works?

Pine doesn't work very consistently in this regard; it does one thing in
some selection lists and another thing in others.  The most common rule
for up/down seems to be not to wrap at all; and, left/right never go past
the first/last item, so they change lines only in the middle of the list.

On one screen where pine has multiple selection lists, up/down can "fall
off" the current list and take you up or down entire categories, but left/
right still can't go past the first/last item in the current list.
