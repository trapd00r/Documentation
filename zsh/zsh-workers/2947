Zoltan, all the tabs in your email message have been converted to spaces.
That's why the patch failed to apply for me; this latest one fails, too.
If I re-tabify with `unexpand -a` then it applies.

I hope this doesn't have something to do with mailing from IBM's network.

If you can't figure out why this is happening, you may have to start
base64-ing or uuencoding you patches. :-(
