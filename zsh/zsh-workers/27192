} Please enligthen me on this one...

Well, I'm speculating because I don't really know what emacs does with
the terminal on different architectures, but for example it might put
the terminal in raw mode and do its own I/O, then send the emacs process
group a signal when emacs reads a character that matches in interrupt
character definition.

That sure seems more sensible to me than trapping SIGINT and treating
it as the input of a ^C when doing keymap processing.
