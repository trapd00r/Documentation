Hello,

(Sorry for the delayed reply.)

The beep in my computer *IS* behaving strangely, but it might not be
zsh's fault.

What I know for sure is that, the tty beep behavior was completely
different from the tty behavior I get at the desktop I use at work (same
zsh version, same zshenv|zshrc files).

Two observations:

1. I *used* to get a beep, when hitting ^G with zsh with "setopt
   no_beep" (but without using setterm). (Is that supposed to happen?)

2. if I start the shell with setopt no_beep, I sometimes can't get it to
   beep again by changing the option (again, without ever touching
   setterm).

Just now I remembered that I changed /bin/sh from /bin/bash to /bin/dash
("Debian Almquist Shell"). Could this influence how the beep works?
That was a difference between my work machine and my own laptop.
Tonight I'll test it.

BTW, does anyone has remarks about using /bin/dash as the /bin/sh clone?
I use it because it does make booting faster.

One thing I discovered is that, ksh-like, dash does set or increment
SHLVL.

Cheers,

BTW... Yesterday I was dealing with the newfound fact that Ubuntu
corrupts the BIOS of Dell laptops. How sweet.
