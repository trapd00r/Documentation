>From looking at _describe, I'm fairly sure that it doesn't offer a way
of passing options on. If you ignore all the parts of _describe which
aren't easy to understand (i.e. the compdescribe builtin), it isn't too
hard to make it pass options on. But without understanding it all first,
I'd be worried about breaking something.
