:How about having a X-Seq-users AND a X-Seq-workers and X-Seq-announce?

Well, you can only do this if you subscribe workers to users and
users to announce.  If a message to users gets ezmlm-send'd to workers
(as it obviously is now) then people in workers are not going to get a
X-Seq-users added.  Well, they can have it added but the sequence number
won't point to the correct users sequence number.

:That way, forwarded messages will contain all (possible) sequence
:numbers, and intelligent archive software could even use this to
:crosslink between the lists. 

Ah, now where do I get this intelligent archive software :-)
