That's extremely suspicious.  You should get some kind of output for
anything, e.g., the default fallback for completion should produce

tags in context :completion::complete:v::
    globbed-files  (_files _default (eval))

What do you get if the word in command position is an entirely non-
existent command, that is, neither a .exe nor a function nor an alias?
Does it matter whether that word is a single character long, or longer?

Do you have autocd set and is there a directory named "v" somewhere
in your cdpath?  I'm sort of grabbing straws here.  You don't have a
v: drive, do you?

} did I find a bug? I am using cygwin on winXP

Unfortunately I don't have a cygwin environment in which to fool with
this, and as 4.3.9 is out now it might be better if you can reproduce
the problem with that rather than 4.3.4.
