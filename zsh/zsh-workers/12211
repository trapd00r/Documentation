% autoload flubba
% flubba
flubba:104: flubba: function definition file not found

The only problem is the `flubba:104:' at the start of the error message.
It's not in the function yet, so shouldn't print that.  I haven't looked,
but the problem must be that autoload makes it think it is in the function,
since that's often useful contextwise.  It isn't here, since you get the
wrong line number (that's the interactive $LINENO at this point).
