Oli,

The version of zsh included with MacOS X.3.x seems to have a functional 
zpty.

[mneptok@anubis] mneptok :: zpty -L
zpty ls -l
zpty date date
[mneptok@anubis] mneptok ::

If you would like, I can try to track down who at Apple built the 
included zsh binary, and if they would be willing to hand their changes 
to you.
