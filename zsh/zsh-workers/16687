Check config.modules in the directory where you ran configure to see if
zftp is being linked in.

By the way, the manual page to read is probably zshzftpsys, which
describes the user friendly function system which runs on top of the
builtin.

I still think zftp handles keyboard interrupts badly.  I still haven't
been able to generate enough interest in doing anything myself.  A prod
would help.
