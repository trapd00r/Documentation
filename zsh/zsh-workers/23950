We could do it with one level of indirection...


Generically:

if [[ -z ${precmd_functions[(R)precmd_prompt]} ]]; then
  precmd_functions+=(precmd_prompt)
fi
precmd_prompt() {
   if (( ${+prompt_functions[precmd]} )); then
     $prompt_functions[precmd]
   fi
}


For each prompt:

typeset -gA prompt_function_hooks
prompt_functions=(precmd my_fantastic_precmd_function
                  setup my_absolutely_superb_setup_function
                  teardown my_truly_wonderful_teardown_function)


and so on.  As long as the functions in question are defined at the same
time as the prompt_functions associative array there isn't a
namespace clash.
