} Does anybody have any preferences?  Does anybody ever redefine HISTCHARS?

I've been redefining HISTCHARS/histchars to replace ^ with = for longer
than I've been using zsh (dating from using csh way back when some tty
terminals did not have | and the Bourne shell interpreted ^ as a pipe).

I'd be fine with restricting HISTCHARS to ASCII, or even to non-alpha-
numeric ASCII.
