Hi,

I'm starting all my zsh scripts with...

#! /bin/zsh -f
emulate -R zsh

...in order to minimize any problems that might occur because other 
systems have other zsh options set.

My question is: does it make sense to do it that way?

I'm especially uncertain about the "emulate -R zsh" and the -R 
parameter because I don't fully understand what it does. Would 
"emulate zsh" or "emulate -L zsh" or "emulate -RL zsh" be even better?


Thorsten
