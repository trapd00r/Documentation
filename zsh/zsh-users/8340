Many thanks for that.  That gets me pretty far along.  One remaining 
thing I want to accomplish is to set colors specifically for when I'm 
logged in as root (something subtle like a BRIGHT RED BACKGROUND and a 
flashing prompt saying YOU ARE ROOT!)

However, I am starting to use 'sudo' instead of logging in as root, so 
that's probably a moot point now.

Thanks for the pointers on the .term files, that's a good solution for 
the time being.
