This is a mirror of http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3366

This script tries to reduce the repetitive work it is to make a file executable. It provides three functions:

SetShebang() which sets the correct shebang (e.g. "#!/usr/bin/python"),
SetExecutableBit() which sets the executable bit, and
SetExecutable() which calls the two functions above.

The SetExecutableBit() is simply stolen from http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Setting_file_attributes_without_reloading_a_buffer . Thanks a lot Max Ischenko!
