That's a bug, but possible not as egregious as you think:  "cd --
-<number>" changes to an entry on the directory stack (and it's
special-cased so you don't need the leading "--").  There's no way
around that, so if the directory were called "-2" you'd still need to use
"./-2".  Here it was treating the second - as a truncated negative
number.  This just fixes cd---I'm not sure if the shell should ever
treat a - on its own in that fashion.
