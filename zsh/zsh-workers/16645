Last mail I had from s(ource)?f(orge)?\.net was Jan 22, which is lot more
than 15 days ago.  But it worked then.

} Er, in what way? It resolves to one place only.

Right, but the pages you get at www.zsh.org just direct you off to
zsh.sunsite.dk and mirrors for anything useful (other than the list
archives).  There's no point in redirecting zsh.org to the sources
site unless we're going to move _everything_ to the same place.

That's separate from the patch manager, but in general I agree.  It's
just harder to get anyone to keep the TODO and BUGS files up to date.

Sigh, yes.  Maybe I'll find time for it soon.  (Right now I'm dealing
with changing ISPs for brasslantern.com because my current one has
dropped dial-up support without reducing the web hosting fees.)

} Or we could stick it in CVS as a separate module.

You mean stick the patches in CVS, or stick 3.0.x in CVS?
