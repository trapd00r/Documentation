Yes, other shells do it that way, but that has its downsides.  For
instance, if you run "touch *,c" it's better to get "no match" rather
than creating a useless *,c file.  Or if you type a command like this:
"rsync -avP *.html *.shmtl *.php host:/dest/" (note the misspelling),
it is better to get a "no match" error right away than to get a single
open-error embedded in all the output that you then have to figure out
at the end of the transfer.  I much prefer to simply put single quotes
around any wild-carded file names that should not be expanded rather
than to configure the shell to include a wildcard that didn't match
anything.  YMMV, of course, but if you give it a try, you may find that
you come to prefer it as well.
