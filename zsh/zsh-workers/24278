Subject: zsh in screen - bad erase key ^@ instead of ^H or ^?
X-Enigmail-Version: 0.95.5
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
X-Virus-Scanned: ClamAV using ClamSMTP

How do I tell zsh in screen that my backspace key is ^H or ^? instead of
^@ as it currently thinks? stty erase '^@' fails as does using tset.
^v(bs key) tells me bs is currently ^@. zsh works great outside of
screen just not quite right inside it. Version is 4.3.2 gentoo stable build.
Any pointers would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks!
