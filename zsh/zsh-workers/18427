What are HAVE_RLIMIT_RSS, HAVE_RLIMIT_VMEM, HAVE_RLIMIT_AS,
RLIMIT_VMEM_IS_RSS, RLIMIT_VMEM_IS_AS?

It's possible to skip the multiplication by 1024 if RLIMIT_AS is defined
and is not the same as RLIMIT_RSS, but I didn't think that was the case
here.  Maybe there needs to be a

# if defined(HAVE_RLIMIT_AS) && !defined(RLIMIT_VMEM_IS_AS)
	    case RLIMIT_AS:
# endif /* HAVE_RLIMIT_AS */

in that switch anyway.
