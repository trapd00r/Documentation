The -i flag tell compinit to check for files or directories that might
be writable by a malicious third party, and to ignore them.  It also
warns you about which files/directories it is ignoring.

So apparently when your latest version was installed, permissions or
file ownership on the completion directories in $fpath were left in an
insecure state.
