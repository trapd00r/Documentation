I think, that key developers should work directly with CVS repository.
There is no sense to post patches if everybody is expected to get them
from CVS. What is actually needed is some release engineering -
development branch(es) for Sven to play with ^-) and stable branch(es)
for other mere mortals :)) Here we actually need designated person who
should decide, what goes into stable branch, do merge etc.
