} I take it what you're really complaining about is that there is no
} subdirectory zsh-3.1.6-test-1 at that point, i.e. 
}   cd anyolddirectorynameatallatall/..
} always succeeds and leaves you in `.'?
} 
} Consider:
} 
} % mkdir ~/tmp/d1
} % cd ~/tmp/d1
} % rm -rf ~/tmp/d1
} % cd ..
} 
} Currently that works fine:  since tmp exists, it changes directory there.
} However, if you insist on the initial directory being valid, then
} (for example) statting ~/tmp/d1/.. will fail, and the cd won't work.
} Furthermore, you can't even stat the relative path "..", since that's gone
} too.  So I don't see a way of reconciling the two things.

It worked (and still works) in 3.0.  What changed?
