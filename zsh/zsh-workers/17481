Subject: 4.0.4: SGI compiler on IRIX 6.5 doesn't work with 
 HAVE_VARIABLE_LENGTH_ARRAYS
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

The SGI compiler doesn't execute goto/continue statements if the block contains
variable length arrays.

Tell configure that we don't have variable length arrays by supplying the option
--enable-cflags='-LANG:vla=off -O'
