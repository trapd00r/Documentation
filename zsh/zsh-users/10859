Thank you, Peter.

This works. But it this way, glob_complete is in effect for every glob
on the command-line when trying to complete.

% ls *.txt<TAB>

drops into a menu, rather than expanding the glob into .txt files.
Would it be possible to enable glob_complete only for the 1st word on
the line other then the following code?

[snip]
function _mycomp () {
  setopt localoptions;
  local buf
  buf=(${(s: :)LBUFFER})                                                                                                                                        if [[ ${#buf} -eq 1 ]] ; then
    setopt globcomplete;
  else
    setopt noglobcomplete;
  fi
  zle expand-or-complete
}
zle -N _mycomp
bindkey "^I" _mycomp
[snap]
