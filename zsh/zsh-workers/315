But :s//foo/ should either use the last substitution as documented already in
the manual or use the whole string to be modified as you want.  Other people
requested the later behaviour (that's why I changed this and that's what the
present maual says about it, I did not change the manual I only changed the
code to conform the maual).

So what to do now?  I'd prefer the present solution as it is consistent with
the history substitution behaviour.
