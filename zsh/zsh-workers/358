Here is the bug:

% zsh -f
bolyai% setopt autolist                                             
bolyai% bindkey '^[[19~' where-is 
bolyai% 
Where is: kill-_
BUG: listmatches called with bogus list

As I remember, it is somewhere in Zefram's code which causes this bug (i.e. it
is not present in beta10).
