Which version is this binding added?  I could not find in both the
4.0.2 and the 4.1.0-dev-1.  I have tried both the emacs and vi mode
and the M-/ is bind to:

    "\M-/" self-insert

A note on dynamic completion key binding: In vim (Vi Improved), the
dynamic completion is available in the insert mode as c-p and c-n.
How about bind it to M-/ in emacs mode and c-p in vi insert mode?
