Everything is moving to 64-bit environment and it's much easier to
have only one set of local libraries for free software.  For example
compiling something like xemacs I will need ten extra libraries and I
rather compile only 64-bit versions if I need these even once and
don't touch 32-bit stuff at all.

Firstly I thought you like to see how my environment is probed but you
like to get piece of code how to detect Sun 64-bit Forte compiler.
