Yeah, it says `select' can be in addition to or instead of `yes' et al.
It doesn't say what happens when `select' is in addition to itself.  It
might be nice to clarify; are there other cases where it's meaningful to
give similar strings multiple times in the value of a style?

(I wasn't going to bother to reply to this, but one of my other messages
to zsh-workers seems to have vanished, so this is doubling as a test.)
