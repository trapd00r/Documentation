By the way, who is the admin of zsh-users and zsh-workers mailing lists? Is
it you Peter, or Bart? Whoever it is, PLEASE make subscription a requirement
to post to the lists. This virus thing is a bad joke that nobody seems to
worry about and solve, so the best solution is to make the lists closed for
posting to non-subscriptors.

It's a pity to have to leave this lists, as another people already did, just
because this virus/spam thing :(
