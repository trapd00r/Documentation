That looks friendlier than before.  Only two remarks:

There should at least be a `&& return 0' after the last spec.

But, and that's the second remark, I strongly suggest that you don't
use states for every action, or states at all.  They actually are the
worst case for _arguments, because it has to give up control. It's
also the most complicated and probably far from bug-free. Ahem.

Maybe use small sub-functions if you can't be bothered to find out if
the action can be put into the specs themselves.


Bye
