Subject: Why isn't $PATH expanded internally?
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Content-Disposition: inline

Hi all,

I am wondering why putting

~/foo
$HOME/foo # as in the string $HOME

into $PATH will not work as expected.

I am rather certain this is not oversight, but I am interested
in the rationale. Is it security reasons (although that seems
strange), execution speed (could be addressed by expanding
on load, but that would reduce functionality) or anything I can
not think of, atm?


Richard
