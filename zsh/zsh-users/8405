Hi!

Completion is very good, but very complex to quickly understand it :) So
far I've configured everything as compinstall was guiding and I'm
satisfied. Only one thing bothers me. I would like to get the list of
hosts not from /etc/hosts file but from some other file. Because then I
can rely on DNS to find the appropriate IP for given file name. And
names I can collect say in ~/.known_hosts one host per line. How can I
set it up?

(in fact ~/.ssh/known_hosts can be such file, but there the host name is
followed by lots of things on the line :)
