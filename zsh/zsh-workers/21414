} Here is a patch to add completion for the UNIX and Linux version of
} unexpand. 

As the completion functions are preferentially installed all into a
single directory (it's an extra configure option to install them in
separate subdirectories), it is necessary to pick one location for
any function -- I suggest Completion/Unix/Command/_unexpand in this
case -- and have the function internally decide which version of the
command it should be completing for.

In other words, combine these into one file with an "if" test of some
sort, and then they could be added to the distribution.
