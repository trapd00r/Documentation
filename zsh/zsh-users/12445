Some of each.  Ctrl-l (the clear-screen widget) is implemented by sending
the "clear screen" terminal control string; what the terminal does with
that is out of zsh's hands, but zsh doesn't have to send that string.

    clear-screen() { repeat $LINES print '' >/dev/tty ; zle -I }
    zle -N clear-screen
