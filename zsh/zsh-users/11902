=====================

yeah, i still had the alias defined; now it works fine as a function. 
since cpv is rsync, but neutered to the point of only copying to/from the 
local system i wouldn't want "compdef _rsync cpv", and i'm not even sure i 
need "compdef _cp cpv", since the default of auto-completing directories 
and files seems to work fine.
