 	Democracy, n.:
 		A government of the masses. Authority derived
 	through mass meeting or any other form of direct expression.
 	Results in mobocracy. Attitude toward property is
 	communistic... negating property rights. Attitude toward
 	law is that the will of the majority shall regulate, whether
 	it is based upon deliberation or governed by passion,
 	prejudice, and impulse, without restraint or regard to
 	consequences. Result is demagogism, license, agitation,
 	discontent, anarchy.
