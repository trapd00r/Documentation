Hi,

I just tried to build the cvs version and to install it
here on my IRIX 6.5 box.

I did 
make distclean
Util/preconfig
configure ...

The build works fine, but
install installs it as
zsh@EXEEXT@

renaming that to zsh and starting it,
I get strangely
1 % /usr/PRIVATE/bin/zsh
interactive
monitor
zle
interactive
monitor
zle
interactive
monitor
zle
"^@" set-mark-command
"^A" beginning-of-line
"^B" backward-char
"^D" delete-char-or-list
"^E" end-of-line
"^F" forward-char
"^G" send-break
"^H" backward-delete-char
"^I" expand-or-complete
"^J" accept-line
"^K" kill-line
"^L" clear-screen
"^M" accept-line
"^N" down-line-or-history
"^O" accept-line-and-down-history
"^P" up-line-or-history

.. and much more

So, what did I miss?
The last production version here is the cvs-version from 2000/02/17

Thanks for any hints,
Helmut.
