    Well, you now, there's no need to hurry up. It's just that I'm in
love with this dammit shell ;)) and I'm impatient for a new release
with even more power and cool things O:))

    All zsh-workers are doing a very good job. My Linux have changed
a lot since I dropped bash ;))

    BTW, I still maintain a featureless copy of bash as my /bin/sh,
since all brain-damaged shell scripts from GNU still use non portable
bashisms, although they claim Bourne compatibility... :(( When I
release a shell script, I write it portably, without any -ism, but
I'm sure that if I ever need to write a non-portable one, I'll do
with Zsh. More features, less bloat.
