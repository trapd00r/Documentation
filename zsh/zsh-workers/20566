> Why SIGCLD and not SIGCHLD for zsh?

It's an artefact of this sort of thing in header files:

#define	SIGCLD		SIGCHLD	/* Same as SIGCHLD (System V).  */
#define	SIGCHLD		17	/* Child status has changed (POSIX).  */

We pick the first one, assuming that's to be preferred.

The following explicitly prefers SIGCHLD.  Any other multiple signals
can be handled similarly.  I'm not sure about SIGPOLL.

Maybe we should think about mapping alternatives so that both kill -CLD
and kill -CHLD work.
