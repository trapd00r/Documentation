Subject: Posting FAQ to Usenet
Date: Mon, 10 Feb 2003 16:57:22 +0000
Message-ID: <6348.1044896242@csr.com>
From: Peter Stephenson <pws@csr.com>

Is anyone able to take over posting the zsh FAQ to Usenet?  My ISP has
apparently decided to abort long postings and as I only have a dial-up
line from home I have little interest in trying to fix things up.

It should simply require telling the news.answers moderators, then
retrieving the ready-made text file from zsh.sunsite.dk and posting it
monthly, so it can probably be automated fairly easy.

Otherwise it won't get posted to Usenet at all (but I'll continue to
maintain it).
