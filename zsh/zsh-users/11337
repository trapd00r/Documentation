Seems to work for me...
The only change I made in the entire script was changing lines like
        echo -e "\033[01;34m$state\033[0m "
to
        echo -e "%{\033[01;34m%}$state%{\033[0m%} "

and then I did
        RPS1="[$(~/downloads/bat_mon.sh)]"

Which gave me
"downloads>                                                         [charged ]"
as my prompt, colored cyan, and tab completion worked fine.  There's
no need to do anything fancy, like port that script itself to zsh -
just adding %{ %} pairs around escape sequences in the echo -e command
ought to be enough.
