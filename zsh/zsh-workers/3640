I can't imagine why either, but this person seems to have a use for it:

(Debian GNU/Linux bug #6236)
From: JR Oldroyd <jr@hautbrion.terra.net>
Subject: BUG zsh $histchars

Package: zsh
Version: 3.0.2-1
It seems that $HISTCHARS is being reset by the shell when the
shell starts up.  This should not be happening.
