I couldn't reproduce the other two but the problem here is simply that
vared only works in the top level shell where the line editor is
running but doesn't bother to test so the error message is a bit
indecipherable.

I don't think there's anything in principle stopping it from running
vared in a subshell, but the logic to do with entersubsh() and the
variables it sets would have to be changed... it's a similar problem
to `jobs' not working in a subshell even though there's no objection
in principle to listing them there.
