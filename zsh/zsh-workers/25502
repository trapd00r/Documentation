If it's only with zcompile'd functions, it could be it just needs a
version number update to deconfuse matters.  It's time I produced a dev
version with a new number.  (There are various things I still need to do
before a proper beta release, most notably the other half of the
completion match control conversion to wide characters.)  I'm around
until Monday, I'll try and fit it in.
