Actually I botched that.  $#array will always be 1, because the argument
(when present) is placed in the same array element as the option.  The
test should be [[ $array == -a ]].

}     set -- -a xyz
}     zparseopts -A array -- a::
} 
} Does that mean that optional arguments must ALWAYS go in the same
} word as the option?

Yes, that's what I was trying to explain.
