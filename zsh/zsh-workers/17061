Odd, because we have gcc 2.95.2 on this Solaris 2.6 system (OS is given
by gcc as sparc-sun-solaris2.6) and it accepts -G and produces shared
libraries without any extra effort.  Have a look in the specs file,
whose location is given by gcc -v.  I have some hieroglyphics after
`*link:' which include `%{G:-G}', which I think means `accept the option
-G during the linker phase and passes it down to the linker itself as
-G'.
