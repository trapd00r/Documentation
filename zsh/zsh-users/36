Probably the neatest way (it doesn't require any editors) is

print -z "$(find . -name 'hey' -print)"

(double quotes necessary) which sticks the output straight into the
multi-line buffer, so you can edit the list and the whole lot will be
executed when you hit return.

If you need an external editor, it doesn't look like fc will help from
reading the manual page --- it doesn't seem to interact directly
either with the line editor or even with standard input: something
like you're original thought is probably necessary.
