No, this is a definite problem.

% LC_ALL=pl_PL
% typeset -f g
% ((g=4.4))
% echo $g
4,4000000000
% ((g=$g + 3))
% echo $g
4,0000000000


And also:

% LC_ALL=de_DE
% echo $g
4,0000000000
% ((g=8.3))
% echo $g  
8,3000000000
% printf "%f\n" $g  
printf: 8,3000000000: value not completely converted
8.000000
% export LC_ALL
% printf "%f\n" $g
8,300000


printf is GNU sh-utils.

As for process times:

% time sync
sync  0,00s user 0,00s system 0% cpu 0,125 total


Anything that uses convfloat() will be affected.
I can't find anything else.
