A while ago, someone complained that options following nice weren't
taken account of in completion.  While I'm waiting for a backup to
restore, here is a basic implementation.

I haven't handled offering the options for nice, which requires subtlety
involving contexts and prefix-needed and so on.

Strictly, I don't think it should test for +<-> since that's only for
the csh builtin.
