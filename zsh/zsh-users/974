echo $(( $z + 6*1/3 )) should do what you need.  It appears * and /
have the same precedence, and the / appears first, so 1/3 = 0 is
computed first ... ;-)

When we learnt how to use a scientific calculator in school, we were
taught "BIMDAS" (Brackets, Indices, Multiplication, Division,
Addition, Subtraction).  In Real Life integer calculation, I've never
seen a system where M & D weren't equal precedence, associating left
to right.  Ditto for A & S.
