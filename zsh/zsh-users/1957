Typing away merrily, Geoff Wing produced the immortal words:
> like and use it.  It's not as if there aren't a few choices.  For starters:

Mostly just variants on a theme.  With the problem that they all look to
produce:
12345678910 (with no newline)

% ( local foo; set -A foo {1..10} ; print $foo )
% ( local foo; print ${(A)foo::={1..10}} )
Handle it, without the trailing space of another suggestion.

I wanted:
% print ${(A)_::={1..10}}
which would nicely leave $_ with the values, but _ is a readonly
variable.  *sigh*
