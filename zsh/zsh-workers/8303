Whups, those are the wrong versions of those files.  I've just put a
rebuilt tarfile on the FTP site with the correct ones, and bumped the
version date to 17oct.  Hopefully no one is too inconvenienced by this;
thanks, Tanaka, for checking right away.

New md5sum:
9ce8b44848249bbf11c1480e252448c4  zsh-3.1.6-bart-7.tar.gz

I'll pick up these later:

}   8063 Doc/Zsh/compsys.yo
}   8109 Src/builtin.c,Src/options.c,Src/zsh.h
}   8110 Doc/Zsh/options.yo
}   8139 Completion/User/_man
}   8138 Src/Modules/mathfunc.c

But hopefully it'll be Peter who makes a release that includes them.
