Just for the record, and then I'll shut up since this is off-topic and I
see enough of this sort of argument on the spamassassin list already ...

(1) If there were another broadband ISP in my area, I'd have used it.
    Unfortunately verizon effectively has a monopoly here because they
    bought the local phone company, the only other DSL provider went
    bankrupt, and my neighborhood does not have line-of-sight to any
    wireless towers.

(2) It's the other end's problem if and only if they want to get my mail.
    I simply refuse to go out of my way to work around the blockage.
