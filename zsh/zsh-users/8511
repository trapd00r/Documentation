That would make sense if cygwin were, in general, POSIX compliant and 
similarly if cygwin treated the mixed case file system as a mixed case 
file system.

That is, however, not the case.  In fact cygwin is all over the map.  If 
you have a file named Filename, and, say, do "vi file<tab>", Filename 
will not appear.  Cygwin more or less wraps the file system in an 
attempt to make the observed behavior as close as possible to a typical 
UNIX case sensitive file system.  This layer does many things that 
cannot be done in the native file system.  For example, it maintains 
pseudo-permissions, and you cannot, say, do something like ./filename 
(to run it), unless it has the x pseudo-permission.  It even does fake 
symbolic links.

I'm not saying it is worth the effort to muck around with the code to 
treat cygwin as a special case.  I'm just pointing out that the reason 
is not because it violates POSIX, because cygwin is miles away from 
being POSIX compliant.
