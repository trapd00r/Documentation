I've finally worked out an easy way of working this out having not
managed to work it out from the termcap entries: the tcsh echotc command
is a lot better than zsh's with 'echotc xn' giving me a yes/no answer.
xn is unset in aixterm and set in xterm, so if we handle it, the word
wrapping will atleast then work for aixterm. It certainly all seems to
work well in tcsh. If I have time, I might have a go at rewriting some
of the tcsh echotc/telltc/settc builtins for zsh, probably in a module.
