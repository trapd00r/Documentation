Sorry, I didn't have a lot of time when I wrote back to you -- my fault. 
 You were exactly right; zsh works fine for me now.  In my .emacs I just put
  (setenv "CYGWIN" "nobinmode")
and now when I start the shell it works great.  I'll submit this as an 
addition to Peter Stephenson's zsh FAQ.

Thanks for your help.
