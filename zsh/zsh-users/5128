please, do not post in HTML.

No AFAIK zsh does not support it. It may be interesting addition aimed
at bash compatibility (and also be useful on case-insensitive file
systems like on Cygwin as example).

You can make completion case-insensitive so as a workaround you could
use ^Xe or like to expand pattern and insert it into command line.
