Ah, great!  Didn't know that feature yet.
Only that I _dont_ have completealiases turned on and it still doesn't work.

In a "zsh -f" session it does work so it must be something in my settings...
On the other hand, with an ls-alias (alias lh="\ls -lFBh") it works.
So why not with sshadmin?  Any idea?

Thanks,
 Andy.
