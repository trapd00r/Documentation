If it's only needed if the system has a bug, then a run-time option is the
wrong way to do it.  Make it a configure-time option (--enable-pass8),
and conditionally compile in such a special version of isprint(), using
it instead of the system's version.

Also this is wrong.  OPT_SIZE must be the last entry in the list, and
the options in the list are in alphabetical order.
