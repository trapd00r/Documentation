OK, but these compatibility modes are not really clear, e.g. which sh
and which ksh? And what about POSIX?

In particular:

vin:~> mkdir 'a[b'
vin:~> touch 'a[b'/file

vin:~> ksh --version
zsh 4.3.4 (i686-pc-linux-gnu)
vin:~> ksh
$ ls a[b/*
ls: a[b/*: No such file or directory

vin:~> ksh93
$ ls a[b/*
> ksh93: syntax error: `[' unmatched

vin:~> ksh -c 'ls a[b/*'
ls: a[b/*: No such file or directory
vin:~> ksh93 -c 'ls a[b/*'
ls: a[b/*[: No such file or directory

vin:~> touch 'a[b/*'
vin:~> ksh93 -c 'ls a[b/*'
ls: a[b/*[: No such file or directory
vin:~> ksh -c 'ls a[b/*'
a[b/*
