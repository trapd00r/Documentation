Is there a way to tell if a script is being called by cron or via
interactive script?  I'm writing something to tell me when disk usage of
various partitions get's to dangerous levels.  When it's run via cron, I
want it to mail me the results.  If it's interactive, I want it to print
the output to the screen.

Any ideas?

Thanks;
Jason
