Subject: PATCH: "typeset -x" acts as if "-g"
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

This change should make "typeset -x" completely equivalent to "export", as
it was before the "-g" option was introduced some while ago.  Note that you
still can't export a local, so neither "export FOO" nor "typeset -x FOO"
changes the environment if there's a local FOO in some surrounding scope.

I looked at lifting that restriction in sh/ksh emulation modes, but I need
to find out why the addenv() in restore_params() doesn't do what I expect.
