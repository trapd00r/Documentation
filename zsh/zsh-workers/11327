Subject: PATCH: return command's exit code from _call
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

completion for groups had broken again, with ypcat dumping error
messages over my terminal. The problem was that _call was now being used
to call ypcat but didn't pass on its exit code.
