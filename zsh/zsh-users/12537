With LC_ALL=C, I get 28 (bash), 7 (dash), 19 (zsh), 9 (ksh93) here
on a Pentium D at 3 GHz in x86_64.

bash 3.1dfsg-9
dash 0.5.4-6
zsh 4.3.5-1
ksh93 93s+20080202-1

Note: on Debian, one needs to run ksh93 as ksh is a symbolic link
and may be some other shell, e.g. zsh. Richard, it seems that your
ksh timing is wrong.
