	Wrong.  At this point, you've written a shell whose scripts can use
GUI objects to interact with end users.  If emacs can do that, it shouldn't.

(You know, if the FSF would just add device drivers to it, we could quit
calling
emacs an editor and call it an OS which seems to be what most of its users
want it to be.)

And, as importantly (at least to some of us), you've written a replacement for
one of the proprietary componets of CDE.

	My $.02 worth,
