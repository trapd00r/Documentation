It does work with the commands. It runs `aptitude -h' and parses the
result to get a list of the commands (and descriptions) so perhaps you
don't have aptitude installed. If it doesn't find aptitude installed, it
won't complete any commands. Try adding in a manual assignment to the
cmds array:

cmds=( install:install/upgrade\ packages remove:remove\ packages )

You should then see how it should work. You could also look at _xauth
but that doesn't handle options.
