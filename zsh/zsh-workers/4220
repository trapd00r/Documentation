I haven't been able to build zsh on IRIX 6.4, or 5.2 for that matter,
because of some problem with the configuration scripts.  The error
occurs near the start of the `make' in Src.

( cd .. && /bin/sh Src/mkmodindex.sh Src ) \
    > modules.index.tmp
`modules.index' is up to date.
cd .. && /bin/sh $top_srcdir/Src/mkmakemod.sh Src Makemod
creating Src/Makemod.in
creating Src/Makemod
make[1]: Entering directory `/a/sgi-f/home_sgi/pws/src/zsh-3.1.4/Src'
creating Src/Builtins/Makefile.in
creating Src/Builtins/Makefile
/bin/sh: Src/Builtins:  not found
make[1]: *** [prep] Error 1

It seems to be rerunning config.status at that point.  So many things
are running so many other things that it's rather complex to sort out
who's doing what to whom.  If anybody's got any ideas, I'd like to
hear, before I waste yet more of my time.

This is an unadulterated 3.1.4 source tree, not previously used for a
compilation.
