Subject: PATCH:  description of PATH_DIRS option.

From: Peter Stephenson <pws@csr.com>

While waiting to see if a test fell over, I started writing some more
option tests and fell over this, which looks like it needs documenting,
though I assume it's always been like that.

I suppose it's like this since other shells expect command searches to work
like this.

I intend to commit this to the 4.0 branch, too.
