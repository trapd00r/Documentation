Hi all,

is there any simple means to enable filename completion
in situations like this one

export PATH=/usr/local/lib/libper  <TAB>

I always have to first insert a blank after '='
and then remove it after completion.
Can I tell the completion system to 'split' after
a certain character (like '=') here.

Many thanks for a hint,
