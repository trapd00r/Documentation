Subject: Zsh 3.1.6 still hangs on for loops utilizing lots of stdout

I'm currently on AIX 4.1.X, and I had this problem with 3.0.5 which made me
try to upgrade to 3.1.6.  Everything seemed to be working great until I did
the following:

for file in *.something
do
  cat $file
done > /tmp/concat

The number of files matched were probably in the thousand or so range, each
with about 10 lines of data.  Zsh hangs on large jobs like this to the
point of having to kill the window entirely (^C doesn't work, neither does
^Z).

Does anyone have any idea how they could possibly reproduce this or
determine if it's an AIX-specific issue?

Thanks,

-Clint

P.S. I'm not on the list, so please Cc me if you want me to provide any
     further info or make suggestions.
