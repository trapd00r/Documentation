So, figure out what's printing out the blank lines.

You mentioned /etc/zshenv.  What about /etc/zshprofile or /etc/zshrc? 
Or maybe even /etc/profile, which is often sourced by system Zsh startup 
files, depending on how Zsh is distributed.

Maybe see if something is set up with hook functions:

$ functions preexec precmd chpwd periodic TRAPDEBUG

As a last resort, try to run Zsh with tracing enabled:

zsh -x  (then Ctrl-d or quit)
[produces lots of output, but maybe near the end you'll see something 
printing out some blank lines]

Might need: zsh -l -x
(not sure how you start your commands in OS X terminal)
