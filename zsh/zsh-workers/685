It's this space that gets in the way.  The passthru variable will
consist of the filename with a space added to the end, which makes a
new filename that does not exist.  Similarly, if you have more files,
they will all become a single argument in the following command, being
interpreted as a single file name.

As long as you don't have filenames which themselves contain
whitespace, replacing ${passthru} with ${=passthru} should do the job,
as this will split the variable into different words.

Hope this helps.

Bas.
