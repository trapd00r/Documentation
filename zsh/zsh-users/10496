On my computer, I have the same setup (plus I make screen startups automati=
c
in .zshrc if I'm not already in a screen).  For me, anything typed before
the prompt is saved and appears correctly when zsh is done loading.  So I
doubt it's a screen-specific setting.  But it may be a termcap issue - try
using a different virtual terminal - or perhaps it has to do with the
always_last_prompt (is that the name?) zsh option being set.
