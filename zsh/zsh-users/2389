I do have a strange problem with the PROMPT variable, persisting since
some time. After upgrading to Linux 6.1, the command
'PROMPT  Hallo' does not change the prompt anymore.

Now, the version of zsh is 3.0 (dated 26 June 1996), but it seems
that it's not the fault of zsh, since on a different machine with the
same version of zsh (but not under Linux but Solaris Unix), this
does work properly.

Does someone has an idea what causes this problem ? Me and our
system operator haven't found a clue so far.

Regards, Oliver Grimm.
