This is a string built with ztrftime() and output with printf() so if
I'd expect similar problems to show up in other places.  Unfortunately
I don't know what to do about it, so unless someone else jumps in we'll
have to wait for PWS to get back.

} ^[[?1;2c
} % 1;2c

That's just the terminal being confused by escape sequences in the
prompt, because something unexpected happened with the printf().  Not
really related.
