} That sounds sensible.  Maybe start using lower-case letters for the
} parts that are big enough to be called `systems', i.e. completion and
} zftp and later probably more?

I don't particularly object, but it doesn't seem to me to be necessary.
If the issue is having "room" in a section for more than 100 test files,
just use three digits instead of two after the letter; surely no section
is ever going to need more than 1000 files?!?
