This isn't quite right because the script is trying to use _pick_variant
to figure out if the tool is a GNU version or not, and this check was
not affected by your patch.  Also, if the user ran gls, presumably we
would need to use the GNU options even on *bsd.  So, a little more
tweaking of your patch looks to be needed (which I don't have the time
to do at the moment, alas).
