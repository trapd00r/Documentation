Subject: PATCH: More vared repairs
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

The -e option, added in zsh-workers/9396 but never mentioned in ChangeLog,
didn't do the right thing in combination with -h, because the call to
hbegin() (also added in 9396) also sets `isfirstln = 1'.  In other words,
using -h always implied -e, which probably was not the desired effect.

It further doesn't seem to me that vared should ever pay attention to the
setting of IGNOREEOF.  If you don't use -e, you can't generate an EOF in
any case, and if you use -e you've asked for EOF behavior.
