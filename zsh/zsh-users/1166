Aha! Right. I hadn't ventured deep engough in zsh's man pages. Sorry for
taking bandwidth with "should have RTFM'd" questions.

Right now I'm trying to understand bitwise manipulations and every day
that passes I thanks zsh for being such a wonderful prototyping tool. No
need to compile stuff, just type away and here comes the result... The
$[2#10010101] stuff comes real handy there to understand binary format.

Again, congratulations to zsh's developers. It's an awesome concentrate
of intelligence sitting behind that modest '%' prompt.
