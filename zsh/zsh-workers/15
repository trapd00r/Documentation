Are you going to address the zstrtol/strtol lossage in this beta?
It's responsible for breaking brace and numeric range globbing:

	$ ./zsh -f
	% echo $ZSH_VERSION
	2.6-beta9-test2
	% echo {1..10}
	1..10
	% touch a.1 a.2 a.3
	% echo a.<1-3>
	$ echo $?
	21

In this case, can't we just go back to using zstrtol like in the old days?
At least it works.
