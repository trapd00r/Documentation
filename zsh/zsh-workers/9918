It even happened in my IE history :-)

Well, I think, you have mentioned it already less than a year ago. Now it
hosts quite a number of products/projects. Access is really good (via a
firewall in Germany in my case it is instant). Important thing is
ready-to-use CVS - normal and HTTP-based. All in all I agree - why not use
this one (keeping CVS repository backups 'course :-)

About lists - why not host them there. I nerver liked "real" domain in list
addresses - so, if we could finally arrange for

workers@zsh.org
users@zsh.org
...

so, that they could be transparently moved over, this would be really great.

The only thing, that bothers me - it is too good to be true :>
