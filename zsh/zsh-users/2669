Hi,

I have been a happy user of zsh for several years (zsh-3.0.2 for at least a
couple). I wanted to get newer bits compiled on HPUX B.11.00 and was not
able to compile. Any guesses as to when zsh might be available on HPUX 11? I
compiled 3.0.2 on HPUX 10.X. Should I just use a 10.X machine?

Thanks!
