Hello again,
after you have helped me so well, I played around with the zsh, and  
found a very cool feature for me :"watch", the command that reports  
login/logout of other users on my system to me.
That works quite well, but is it possible that the zsh automatically  
reports a new user ?
Right know I have to press <ENTER> before a new user is reported. I  
would like the zsh to print the log by itself.

Thanks again
