} I assumed that (o) was equivalent to what the completion system did.

It may very well be, and most likely is.

} Well, the only ways I can see of completely removing problems like this
} are to pass down an additional argument into _description and _wanted to
} stop it using the style, or use a different style.

These aren't necessarily problems to be removed, just behaviors to be
documented.  There's no reason one can't have a style for sorting the
results of _expand and another more specific style for sorting a tag
context.

OTOH, I wonder whether _description should NOT use the style when an
explicit -J or -V argument has been passed?  Most of the time there is
no -J/-V argument at all to _description.
