Hello,

I found that .zlogin is sourced not only when the zsh is a login shell
but also when it is an interactive shell.

This happened in zsh 2.6-beta4, 3.0.5 and this happens in 3.0.6.

Would it be corrected and when the corrections should be expected?

Thank you in advance.

Regards,

Andrei Emelianenko
