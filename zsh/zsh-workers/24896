Actually, FYI, gnome-terminal and konsole also support 256 colors;
TERM=gnome-256color and TERM=konsole-256color. Konsole, in fact,
supports all 24-bit colors through its own extended syntax (CSI 38 ; 2
; <rrr> ; <ggg> ; <bbb> m), though I don't know of any apps that use
it...  Though we could allow it here if we had the same "send this
string to start highlighting and this string to end" sort of thing
like we can do in prompts...
