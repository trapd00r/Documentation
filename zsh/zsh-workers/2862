} I think it would be a good idea to make history beginning-search bound to
} M-p and M-n by default instead of history-search.  I personally never use
} history-search, I always found it quite useless as history-beginning-* is
} much better.
} 
} In fact, in tcsh M-p is bount to history-beginning instead of history search.
} 
} Any objections to change this default?

I don't object to that default, but I still think the old behavior of
history-search-* should be restored.

} I don't think anyone objected except me, which I found surprising.

I'd have objected if I'd seen it.  I still have a slew of zsh mail that
I stashed away while on my midwinter's holiday; there must be something
about this in there, where I haven't gotten to it yet.  (I also haven't
had a chance to build a new zsh since then, unfortunately.)

} I think the new method is less versatile.  Sure it agrees with the
} man page, but it would have been just as easy to fix the manual.

Agree completely.
