hi -=20

i found a neat looking prompt written for bash that i'd like to use with
zsh. the whole thing looks like:


CW=3D"\[\033[0;1;37m\]"   #Color for [ and ]
CB=3D"\[\033[0;1;34m\]"   #Color for label
CR=3D"\[\033[0;1;33m\]"   #Color for value
NC=3D"\[\033[0m\]"        #No Color
MT=3D"\[\033[0;0f\]"      #Move to the top
SP=3D"\[\0337\]"          #Save Position
RP=3D"\[\0338\]"          #Restore Position
CL=3D"\[\033[K\]"         #Clear Line

TOPBAR=3D"$SP$MT$CL$CR User: $CB\u$NC$CR  Host: $CB\h$NC$CR Time:
$CB\t$NC$RP"
PS1=3D"\n$CW[$CB\w$CW]$NC$TOPBAR"

i'm not really sure at all where to start with this, the only thing i
would really know how to do is "translate" the "\u,\h,\w" to something
zsh understands. can someone point me to a good place for starting to
"convert" this?

Thanks!

Jo
