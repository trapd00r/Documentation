I plan to call the next stable line as 3.0.X and the next beta line to
3.1.X.

HOSTTYPE is obsolate.  There is $MACHTYPE $VENDOR $OSTYPE instead.  This
comes from GNU autoconf.

"\!=# still works.  You probably wanted to write '\!=#'.  I mentioned this
change in my previous mail.

That's because sh compatibility has higher preference now.

Yes, SHLVL is exec related.  Again it is for better sh compatibility.

For exec, you can now alias exec to 'unset HISTFILE ; exec'.

2.5 was still very buggy.  I hope that zsh now stabilized a bit by now.
