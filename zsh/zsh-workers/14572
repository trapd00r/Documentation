From: Peter Stephenson <pws@csr.com>

Yodl seems to be inserting too many .RE's after the `read' entry in
zshbuiltins.1 which is confusing nroff here:  all the remaining entries
appear without the usual indentation.  Alternatively, Solaris's nroff
may not be handling multiple sets of indentation properly.  Is anyone old
enough to be familiar enough with nroff to know which?
