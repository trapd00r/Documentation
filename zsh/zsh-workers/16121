Looks to me like you've deleted too much in the top level Makefile.  If you
commented out

  # install/uninstall just the man pages
  install.man uninstall.man:
        @cd Doc && $(MAKE) $(MAKEDEFS) $@

then uncomment the first line and try again.

In fact, you're basically there --- the only step which didn't work is
installing the documentation you don't have anyway.  The shell, libraries
and functions should all be correctly installed.

You might want to look at 
  ftp://ftp.zsh.org/pub/development/
which has a reasonably recent development version including pre-built
manual pages.
