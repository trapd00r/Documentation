Yes list_packed made a satisfactory difference.

OK I see.  The (GNU) ls algorithm uses variable column widths separated with 2
spaces, whereas zsh by default uses the same column width for all the columns
separated by 3 spaces.  List_packed makes the widths variable but still keeps
the spacing of 3.

Configurable spacing sounds good sometime.  I assume 3 was for readability,
but 2 or 1 is better to conserve space.  TeXish stretch and shrink?
