Or use "noglob" as a prefix, which can be done using an alias:

    alias lsnew='noglob lsnew'

Then you can use "lsnew foo*" without quoting any wildcards.

(I vaguely recall that having an alias call a function of the same name
might cause a problem in some older zsh versions, but it works fine in
4.2.5.)
