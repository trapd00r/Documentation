I was guessing as much.  It's not a condition that comes up often.

I discovered this "problem" when I set up a new account for myself on
a new system.  I have HISTFILE set to  "~/.local/var/lib/zsh/history"
in an attempt at making my home directory somewhat Filesystem Hierachy
Standard "compliant".  Now "~/.local/var/lib" existed, but zsh wasn't
there.  Thus Zsh failed to open the history file.
