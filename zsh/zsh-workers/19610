I'd be fine with licensing it under Zsh's license (I guess that makes me
part of the Zsh Development Group). I'll ask them about it.

The commands
  tla delta lord@emf.net--2003b/tla--devo--1.1--patch-286 \
    lord@emf.net--2004/tla--devo--1.3--patch-1 changes
  tla show-changeset changes | grep 'libarch/cmd-.*\.c$'
give a list of the relevant changed files since my last update. However,
many of these are irrelevant changes, which you can determine by
examining the files in changes/patches. It also looks like there are no
new aliases (found in libarch/cmds.c). The changed files are:
