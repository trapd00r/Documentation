Correct.  I had meant to discuss that, but neglected to do so.

Since we're using O_CREAT to ensure that we open a new file, I didn't
see any need to also specify O_NOCTTY -- i.e. how can the file be a tty
if it was just created?

Since some of the replaced open() calls used O_CREAT included O_NOCTTY
and some didn't, I chose to settle on leaving it out.  If I was wrong
about the flag being useless, we can add it back in.

Thanks for checking over the changes!
