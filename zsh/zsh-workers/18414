I don't think (( is even a word.  It's two nested subshells.  A
conforming shell should run the command $count, with stdin redirected
from $NUMLOOPS, inside a subshell inside a subshell.  ash behaves this
way:

$ while (( 1 < 2 )) ; do echo hi ; sleep 1; done
1: not found
$ while (( true < 2 )) ; do echo hi ; sleep 1; done
cannot open 2: No such file or directory

[[ is a different story, though.  Forcing that to be interpreted as a
command has a precedent: "[" aka test.
