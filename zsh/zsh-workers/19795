Very nice.

I would tend to be inclined to use _generic to avoid needing such setup
code. Also makes it a lot more configurable. Trouble is, that you need
to manually define:
  zle -C history-lines menu-complete _generic
  zstyle ':completion:history-lines::::' completer _history_lines
  bindkey '^X:' history-lines

I wonder if we should make #compdef -k, make widgets go through
_generic somehow. It isn't ideal that with #compdef -k, the function is
effectively operating outside of compsys, using raw compwid.
