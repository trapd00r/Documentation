I noticed in the FAQ distributed with a recent version of zsh that the
history code was undergoing a facelift. 

Given one bug that has been in there quite a while, would the people
currently working on the history thing be able to use an extra keyboard?

Did a patch I submitted yesterday actually get to the list? I
wasn't subsribed at the time...
