I suppose it might be sensible to test for multibyte support early on in
configure and if it's present put ncursesw to the front of the library
search list?  (With last week's patch --with-term-lib=ncursesw works.)

Would it be more consistent to make zcurses the command name and
the action the first argument (c.f. zle, ztcp, zsocket, ...)?
