I was wondering if that might have been it, when you mentioned the
patched version.  (I don't have a version with that patch applied here,
so I couldn't test it.)  I sent this patch; it fixed a problem with
menu completion of parameters.  (Extra characters were deleted.)

I have neither the time nor facilities here to fix this properly, but
at a wild guess, try putting

	else if(complexpect)
	    addedsuffix = 1;

on the end of the new version of the conditional.
