Sorry about that.  I never do a make in the top directory, that's why I always
forget it.  Also I do not have autoconf (I was too lazy to get it).  For those
having such problems, just do a `touch configure' in the main zsh directory.
I repacked the tar.gz source with correct dates.  The only change is the date
of configure, so do not download it if you already have it.  The file changed
is:

-rw-r--r--  616509 Oct 11 09:01 zsh-2.6-beta11-test9-hzoli11.tar.gz

If you use the patch to vanilla test9, you will probably have similar
problems, but I do not repack the patch file.
