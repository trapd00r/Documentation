I don't know of any that are particularly specific to one platform. There's
quite a few where we run the command with --version or --help to
see if they are the GNU version or not and this is even generalised into
_pick_variant in zsh 4.1. In some like _finger, the output of finger -\?
is parsed to determine which options are available and in others like
_mount, we use a case statement depending on "$OSTYPE".

_find could certainly be improved in that area. At the moment I think it
just completes a set of fairly common options.
