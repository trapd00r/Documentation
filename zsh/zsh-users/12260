You mean you've tried and completion after

  ssh -l admin

works while completion after

  alias sshadmin="ssh -l admin"
  sshadmin

doesn't?

I presume you mean even after "compinit", otherwise you're using a
different form of completion.

Try using the debug binding "^X?" to generate an output file which
should show you if it's ever getting as far as ssh completion or is
trying completion for something else.
