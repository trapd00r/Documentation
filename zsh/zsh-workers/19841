This seems to fix the bug I just reported; there may be a more elegant
way -- such as, simply inserting a new (#q...) in the right place -- but
I wasn't sure what ramifications that might have for the "copy qualifiers
from the line" section that creates $tmp3 (just above the patched lines).
More patching may still be needed for that portion.
