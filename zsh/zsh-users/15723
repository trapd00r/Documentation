Hi
Until now I've been writing zsh wrappers for my perl scripts:-

I've got
alias -s pl=perl
So I can execute a script just by typing its name

> /usr/local/bin/info.pl

But I want to execute it from anywhere , but it doesn't seem to notice perl 
scripts even if they are in my $path or $fpath

I can however do:-

>=info.pl

Is there a better way

And finally I'd really like to execute it just with

>info
