    Hi Bart :)

    Well, I don't use emacs, but I can see what you mean. I thought
that modules may have an undocumented hook feature.

    Well, then I'll stick to loading the module explicitly. It
doesn't do no harm, really, I was just wondering if a better or
neater solution existed.

    Thanks :)
