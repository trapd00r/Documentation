Subject: vared messes up tty state
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

If you have `stty -echo` as e.g. in an emacs buffer and you run vared,
then after vared exits, echo mode has been forced back on.

`ttyctl -f` has no effect on this.

Arguably, vared shouldn't even work in this condition (it behaves as
if SINGLE_LINE_ZLE, when in fact ZLE is entirely disabled).
