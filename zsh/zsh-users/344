I tried building under NEXTSTEP 3.3.  './configure' generates two core  
dumps; apparently the linker chokes trying to link POSIX stuff without  
'-posix', since building the test program which does  
tgetent((char*)0,"vt100") coredumps using either NeXT's cc or a gcc-2.7.2 I  
built.

Pressing on, I built zsh, but I didn't notice any obvious slowdowns.
