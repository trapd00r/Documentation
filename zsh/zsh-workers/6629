Hello.

Bart> This took far longer than it should have, but I think this is right.

This is what I really want.  I tested this patch, and NO problem! 

----------------

I}     4. If above is void, use 80*25.
Bart> I'm sticking with 80x24, ....

I} "After some command",
I} 
I}     1. If COLUMNS/LINES are different from internal columns/lines
I}        value, COLUMNS/LINES are used.

Bert> No, that can't be right.

Sorry, I was wrong.

------------------

I hope this will be merged into new zsh.
