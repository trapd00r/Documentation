While easy to invoke, that mayn't be the wisest approach.

Should there not be a path to zsh, for some reason, you might discover
yourself unable to login anymore.

I'd be *much* more inclined to run some test for existence first, and,
better still, to test that zsh actually works before committing to
"exec zsh"

Thus, a logic like...

if -e /usr/bin/zsh; then
   if /usr/bin/zsh "invoke something that should return true"; then
      exec /usr/bin/zsh
   fi
fi

Perhaps that should involve a search for where zsh is...

Oddly enough, this is completely standard behaviour for shells. This
is a roundabout way of saying `don't use combined chains of `&&'s and
`||'s unless you think G=F6del's theorem is for sissies'.
