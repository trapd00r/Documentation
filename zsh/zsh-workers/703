I want to announce that the release date of
zsh-3.0 will be March 4, 1996.  It's been a very
long time since the last production release, so
we should release something relatively soon.
There is still much work I would like to
incorporate before this release, so expect the
rate of beta releases to speed up.  I will
probably make a new beta release every week
to week-and-a-half.
