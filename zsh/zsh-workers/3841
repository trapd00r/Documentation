As there appears to be a consensus, I'll consider that official.

Henceforth, the primary archive is

	<URL:ftp://mason.primenet.com.au/pub/zsh/>

(That's Geoff's site.)  Wait until Geoff has got the site up to date
before you start mirroring it.

I'll make a 3.1.3 release shortly; it'll be little change from
3.1.2-zefram4.
