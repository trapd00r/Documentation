Ah, I see.  Old hooks get deleted when the prompt is set up, just before
prompt_*_setup is run.  You need something like:

    add-zsh-hook precmd prompt_bart_precmd

*inside* (or after) prompt_foo_setup.

This did indeed change.  How to add new prompts to the themes was never
a documented interface, only how to use it; the only way to do it has
bene to look at the existing themes.  Feel free to supply documentation
if you think it's lacking.
