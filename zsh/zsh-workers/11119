bor@itsrm2% nslo<TAB>
Completing external command
nslookup
Completing shell function
nslookup

This obviously makes no sense. We _may_ make completion so smart, as to
insert full pathname (or command) for external commands - but currently
nslookup will always execute functions, won't it? So, the above has one
unambiguous match?
