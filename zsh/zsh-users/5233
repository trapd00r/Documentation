Sorry, I was not enough precise.
`file zsh.core` says: zsh.core: OpenBSD/i386 core from 'zsh'.
zsh version 4.0.4, build from OpenBSD package zsh-4.0.4.tgz with the
pkg_add command which does everything automatically, not allowing to
make modifications, like: "configure --enable-zsh-debug".

You are right, gdb reads zsh.core somehow, but I could not extract from
it any useful information, like the line, on which the script crashed.
And gdb does not allow to debug zsh script.

So, now my question is: is there some way to debug large zsh script
like "C" or "C++" program?

Thanks,
Valery

The core files should be readable by gdb or dbx.  However, by default
zsh is compiled using optimization and with debugging symbols stripped,
so there won't be very much useful information in the core file unless
you built zsh with "configure --enable-zsh-debug".

What does `file zsh.core` say?
