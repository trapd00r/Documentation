That's a possibly enhancement to match-words-by-style.  There is already
code in the `shell' word-style case to look at where the cursor is in
terms of shell words.  This can be copied or moved earlier and used
based on another style (eg. word-context, form to be decided).  Then we
can combine the result of that test with the value of the style in some
way, and use that to generate a new value of curcontext for looking up
the standard styles (word-style, word-chars, word-class).

Or something.
