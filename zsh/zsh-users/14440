If you mean immediately after the //, I think actually it's almost working.
I think it's a similar problem to the one Greg reported not so long ago:
it's generating the file names (host names in this case) but is hanging by
trying to stat every single path.  As usual with _path_files, however, all
simple tweaks seem to run into obscure problems.
