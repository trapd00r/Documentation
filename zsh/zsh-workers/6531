I haven't really decided, because I don't really know what the criteria for
3.1 still being a beta version was.  If 3.1.6 is stable we should certainly
think about a production release 3.2 or even 4.0.  I don't think I want to
change the sequence before that, however.  The key seems to me to be
testing the next version as widely as possible.  For example, dynamical
loading, which is a key feature, is reported not to work on SunOS 5.7, and
it's quite possible --enable-lfs is doing something to --enable-zsh-mem,
and so on.  There weren't actually so many complaints about 3.1.5.
