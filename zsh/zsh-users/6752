I have my HISTSIZE set to 3000 already.  The problem is, when I type 
"history", I can only see 16 entries despite the fact I have hundreds 
of entries in my history file.  Is there a way to get the "history" 
command to display all the entries in the history file like the command 
does in bash?

Thanks.

Sincerely,
Peter
