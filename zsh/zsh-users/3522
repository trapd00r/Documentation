When I "setopt CSH_NULL_GLOB" and do "ls *.cc *.c" in my home directory, it
lists all the files there (i.e. none of the GLOBs matched anything and they
have been both removed without error).  I was expecting an error, or at the
very least nothing to be listed.  Do I misunderstand this option or is there
something wrong?
