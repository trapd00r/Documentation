I think adding anything to 3.0 is a mistake.  We should instead hurry to
get 3.2 out the door.  3.1.x has too many neat features that most people don't
get to use since RedHat and friends only come with 3.0.5.

Adding any of the three to 3.1 makes sense, but to 3.0 ?
I really wish the next 3.1.x were called 3.2.0.

PS: GNU ls's LS_COLORS code is brain dead:  if you want to include it at least
    try to fix it so that its auto-detection of color capability is a bit less
    pathetically optimistic (trying to colorize the output when TERM=dumb
    is ...well... dumb!)
