Is there a simple way to insert all the possible completions into the
current commandline?  Something like list-choices, but have the results
placed into the commandline, rather than having to copy them one-by-one.

I can't find a builtin widget for it, and it's not clear to me how to write
one.

Thanks,
Danek
