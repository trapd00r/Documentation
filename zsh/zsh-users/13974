What does
	zsh +o globalrcs -fc 'print -l $fpath'
show?  Does it differ from what
	zsh -ilc 'print -l $fpath'
shows?

If the functions are installed in a directory tree rather than in one
flat directory, then the compiled-in fpath should reflect that (or
someone has done something fishy).  It's more likely that one of the
/etc/z* files is incorrectly stepping on the fpath.
