Use 'rehash'.

zsh hashes many things, including commands in PATH. I usually just
type rehash when I've put new stuff in my command path (IE installing
software packages). If it really bugs you to type rehash, you can have
zsh do so periodically, but this really doesn't solve the immediate
problem.
