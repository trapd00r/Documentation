} The other nit is ...

I guess I ended my list too soon.

I just finished going through compinstall, hit `0' to save and exit,
was told that my .zshrc had been backed up and successfully rewritten --
and found nothing new in it.  It's identical to the backup.

Fortunately I enabled the settings for the current session, so I can
just dump them where I want with "zstyle -L".

I'm sure the reason it didn't work is because I'd never used an older
version of it, so the $endline string didn't already appear in my .zshrc;
but I'm going to let PWS decide on the right way to fix it.
