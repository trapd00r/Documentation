Yes, sorry; I've been a bit slack about documentation :-) Problem is,
I'm spending way more time on just the coding than I should be, let
alone anything else ...  Documentation for these will follow when the
appropriate tuits present themselves, and I'll document new stuff as
it comes, which is the best way of doing things anyway.

There's also the `Completion System Configuration' section of the info
pages.  Is it a deliberate choice that descriptions of most of the
standard completion functions (e.g. _dirs, _users, _groups) are
missing from the info pages?  If not, should they go in the `Utility
Functions' section, or maybe in a new section immediately following it?

Nice idea.  I'll try to get around to that too.

This is all very sweet, albeit somewhat ambitious!  I look forward to
the day it's implemented.

Out of curiosity, has anyone any ideas on what the official release
plans are for the near future?  3.1.7 soon, or not?  Are there any
more big plans for 3.2?
