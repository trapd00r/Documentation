I'm putting this back on the zsh-users list, since that's probably
what you meant to do.  :)

To view the subsections, press 'enter' on the line describing them
(the one that starts with a *).  I'm not sure if I understand the
question about searching the info index, but try hitting 'd' followed
by '/regex' and see if that does what you're looking for.  The
features it offers can be found with ':help manpageview-info'
