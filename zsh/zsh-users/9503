Hi,

 Most of the time I am working under an X11-Environment with a
 windowmanager. Therefore I have no real login shell. Therefore^2 :)
 there is no execution of zlogout for me, since I login into X11
 directly (no "startx" from the console).


 Is it possible to "shell-program" or configure any neat trick (you
 see, I am missing the right words here...) that "something" will be
 executed, when the last of the non-login-shells, which are running
 under my uid, is sclosed ?

 Thank you very much for any help in advance ! :O)
 Have a nice weekend!
