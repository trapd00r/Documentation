I don't see any way around this, without taking away good and necessary 
behavior.

You can always use the really simple solution, which is not to have a 
name clash at all.  I use a short script I wrote to tell me whether a 
name is already defined somewhere.  It's got a bug in it w.r.t. 
functions (which makes it useless at the moment) but I'll (presumably) 
fix that.

IMHO, it is always better to keep things explicit rather than relying on 
the sequence of operations in the implementation.

A warning, as someone suggested, might be a better solution.
