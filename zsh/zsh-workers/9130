Still not convinced.  I'm not interested in saving typing this way, but I
am interested in being able to load different modules for testing without
fiddling with $fpath.  The bogus modules don't seem neater to me,
particularly if you look at the library directory without knowing what you
expect to find.  Aliasing with zmodload seems to me to avoid, not create,
hidden grotesqueries within the shell (certainly if you consider the
essential modules to be part of the shell, which I would).

The way I suggested, you can decide by yourself very easily which names
are to exist without the zsh/ prefix.
