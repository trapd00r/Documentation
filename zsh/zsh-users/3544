The only reference I have been able to find to the
Windows port of zsh is on ftp.blarg.net, which seems
to always refuse anonymous ftp connections.

If there is another pickup-point for this software,
would someone please tell me what it is?  And if not,
would someone be kind enough to send me a copy?  I
can provide an ftp dropoff-point, if anyone would
make the file-transfer to me.

Thanks!

Regards,
