Subject: Redirection completion
Date: Fri, 08 Mar 2002 12:33:14 +0000
Message-ID: <21013.1015590794@csr.com>
From: Peter Stephenson <pws@csr.com>

I'm just amusing myself between tasks by playing with the new system for
completing redirections.

Is the patch at the end useful?  I got caught out because I originally
defined a completion for a non-existent type `redir'.  The list of types
appears to be closed --- i.e. you can't add your own because they're
handled internally --- in which case it's safe to test the type.

Next, it looks like the context for redirections isn't all that helpful
at the moment.  After `echo 2>' I seem to get just
`:completion::complete:echo::'.  Could we have something like the way
arguments work, so that it at least indicates we're in a redirection,
and preferably also the `2>' bit?  Along the lines of
  :completion::complete:dvips:option-o-1:
I would suggest
  :completion::complete:echo:redir-2>:'
for `echo 2>'.

Another point is that I don't seem to be able to supply completions for
`2>|' and so on, but maybe I haven't tried hard enough.

(What I was trying to do, for orientation, was make completion after any
`2>' prefer to send output to local files with the suffix `.log'.  I
came up with this:


#compdef -T redirs 2> 2>>

local expl

_wanted logfiles expl 'log files' _path_files -g "*.log" && return 0
_wanted all-files expl 'all files' _files


This always prefers log files, and it would probably be nicer to use
_alternative.  But then I need a tag order to make sure they don't all
get shown at once, and for that I need a context.  At least, I think.
Thinking some more, I could probably do all this more easily with
file-patterns, but that definitely requires more specific context
information.)

By the way, I think I'm going to expand the user guide to include more
recipe-style information.  If anyone wants to send me a list of stuff
that can be done that's not described at the moment (see
http://zsh.sunsite.dk/Guide/zshguide06.html) I'll add it.
