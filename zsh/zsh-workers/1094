in zsh 2.5.03 is there a problem with tilde (~) compleation from within
shell scripts?  Or am I simply doing something moronic?  (entirely
posible.)  What I am doing is running some shell scripts that other people
have written (mostly for ksh) from my zsh shell.  They don't have the line
#!/usr/bin/ksh
in the top, and when they do, things tend to work.

hmmm.  My logic tells me that this should work reguardless of the #! line,
(but if it was something like bash, other things would break)  Or this
could simply be me not knowing the shell I use nearly well enough.  :)
