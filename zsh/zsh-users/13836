} Couldn't one use the -r switch to print as well?

One could, except that in this case the strings \e and \a are *meant*
to be expanded by print.  So, you could do *three* prints:

precmd() { print -Pn "\e]0;%n@%m: "; print -rn "$1"; print -n "\a" }

} I think it's really unfortunate that print has the same default
} interpretation of its arguments as echo.  It would have been nice if
} there was a command that didn't interpret escapes by default.

Alas, zsh did not invent "print", it copied it from ksh.
