Give it time and you might find it isn't so bad once you get used to it.
I wouldn't condemn the whole OS just because you need to add a few extra
things to the default path and don't get a manpath command.

I tend to setup the path separately for different systems

In my opinion, this is a very unsafe thing to do. You get used to the -i
option, then one day when you have to use a system that lacks your
personal settings, you will lose some files because you were going to
type no for the files you wanted. It's better to call your alias
something else like ri and get used to it.

You can do:
    \rm -rf /junk
Any quoting on an alias prevents alias expansion.
