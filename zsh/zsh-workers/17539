}     It works because compctl is loaded!. I don't know how it gets
} loaded, but it is :????

Normally zsh/zle and zsh/compctl are both loaded as soon as zsh is ready
to print the prompt.  I don't know of any way to prevent it other than to
disable zle (e.g., run "zsh +Z"), or to have a messed-up module_path, but
that can't be it because you've said you're using a static link.
 
}     Well, the fact is that if I load compctl and after that complist,
} all works OK, so I'm happy with this. Why I must load compctl is just
} curiosity ;))

If you're willing to look at it that way, OK.  Me, I'd be worried that it
means something else is broken, too.
