Ok - then a few questions arises:

1. In which order is path and PATH used ?

2. what can I do to convert a variable from colon-seperated list to an
array ?
e.g. do this: path=list2array(/usr/bin/:/nonexisting/name) => path=(
/usr/bin /nonexisting/name )
I need this as the university im using zsh uses colon-seperated lists
for their systemwide paths 

Best regards,
Max
