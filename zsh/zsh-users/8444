The interesting thing is that if I issue

"which lf"  it tells me that lf is aliased, not that it is defined as a 
function.  If I then issue the newly defined lf command, the function 
takes precedence over the alias (which is what I understood to be the 
expected behavior), which I can see from the error messages produced.

The problem arose because a user made the alias without checking to see 
that the function was defined, and that the function was written as a 
posix function and defined after the alias in the sequence of shell 
initialization.

If the alias is defined after the posix function is defined, the 
problem doesn't arise.
