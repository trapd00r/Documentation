(sorry, should have gone to the list but went to Bart privately by
mistake.)

execute-named-command as well as the isearch commands have horribly
incestuous ways of using key bindings.  They could do with being
rewritten as a suite of functions with special keymaps.  I briefly
looked at this for isearch and it's non-trivial.  This would be a
splendid project for someone with a firm grip on themselves and
adequate supplies of a good malt.  As things stand I will probably be
available to work on this myself in 2012 (but don't hold me to it).
