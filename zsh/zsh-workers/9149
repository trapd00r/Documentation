Subject: PATCH: _cd not completing in $cdpath
Date: Thu, 23 Dec 1999 21:54:06 +0000
From: Peter Stephenson <pws@pwstephenson.fsnet.co.uk>
Message-Id: <E121GA8-0008Mh-00.1999-12-23-21-52-45@mail4.svr.pol.co.uk>

(Andrej just reported this after I'd noticed it.  I've left in the fact
that . gets removed.  I think this is to do with the local-directories and
path-directories tag being separate; local files do get completed at some
point.)

_alternative re-evaluates arguments passed to it, so a string like
 '\(/home/pws /home/pws/tex\)'
isn't good enough as a path for _path_files -W because it gets split on
spaces, whereas _path_files needs it as a single argument.  If that's the
correct behaviour for _alternative --- and I suspect it is, because there
are uses like
  _alternative 'files:: _files' 'parameters:: _parameters'
--- then _cd needs fixing.

The simple solution, passing the name of a parameter instead of the
concocted string, took me ages to think of.  It turns out then that an
extra fix is required in _path_files for directories with spaces in: the
parameter was split with an extra ${=...}, which seems to me unnecessary
since it should be a proper array anyway, that's what they're for.
