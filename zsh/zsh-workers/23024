Done.  Comments welcome.  See the Bugs section at the end of
zshcalsys.1.

By the way, I added one fix outside this module: the file-list style can
be made to avoid trampling on an external "stat" programme by preloading
the stat builtin and disabling it:

zmodload zsh/stat
disable stat

This is also appropriate for the "age" glob qualifier function, which
also uses the stat builtin.
