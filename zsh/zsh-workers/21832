} I haven't been able to see any problem with long prompts

Sorry, it's not actually the length of the prompt that matters, it's that
the window is narrow enough that the prompt fills it and completion lists
must thus begin two lines below the prompt instead of one line below.

It may also require that at least one file name is also wider than the
window, or that the listing itself does not fit in the number of lines
remaining (so that complist has to scroll up and down while cycling
through a menu-selection).

} Also, does the long-prompt patch need to be applied to 4.2?

Apparently, though calling it a "long-prompt patch" is a misnomer.
