This is done by the value of $LISTMAX:

- zero: ask if list is bigger than screen
- positive: ask if more matches than that
- negative: ask if more lines than that

Hm, maybe if we turn it into a scalar and make a value of `scroll' (or 
`page') allow a very simple pager, builtin (which I, too, definitely
prefer), that is used if the list doesn't fit on the screen, with a
few keys:

- space: next screen (surprise!)
- return: next line
- q: stop listing
- <any>: stop listing and process key as usual

Going back in the list is a problem...

I like to hear that. The first sentence, that is ;-)
