Not exactly; I'm just providing a historical reference point so we're sure
we've made the right decision.

OK, I'm good at that.

15931 has almost got it, but:

bash2-2.03$ (trap 'echo exiting' 0; true)
exiting
bash2-2.03$ 

zagzig% (trap 'echo exiting' 0; true)
zagzig% 

It matters where the trap was set, as well.
