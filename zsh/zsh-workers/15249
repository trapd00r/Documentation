This should be possible. zsh is not fully bash-compatible, but it should be
to the large extent sh-compatible (where sh means POSIX sh) if called as sh.
I just run zsh's own configure with zsh in shell mode.

But we do not have any specific compatibility tests. Keep in mind that many
Linux scripts silently assume bash and are *not* portable. It is not zsh
fault :-)
