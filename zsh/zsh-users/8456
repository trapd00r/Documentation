I've uploaded version 4.2.4 of zsh to ftp.zsh.org.

This fixes a few problems noticed in 4.2.3, two of which seemed worth a
new version.

- configure hung on recent versions of Cygwin.  Finding a couple of
  optional packages on Cygwin (pcre and iconv) has also been improved.

- The test operators -nt and -ot could cause an initialisation script
  (such as .zshrc) or another script or function to abort.  This would
  happen in tests of the form [[ fileA -nt fileB ]] or
  [[ fileA -ot fileB ]] where fileA existed but fileB did not or its
  details could not be accessed.

- A command like
    ENV1=val1 ENV2=val2 echo
  (where "echo" could be any builtin that should restore variables after
  execution) did not properly restore the values of the environment
  variables after the command finished.  This has been present for a
  long time, but it happens to have been spotted between 4.2.3 and
  4.2.4.
