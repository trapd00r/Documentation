jobstates
     This associative array gives information about the states of the
     jobs currently known. The keys are the job numbers and the values
     are strings of the form `JOB-STATE:MARK:PID=STATE...'. The
     JOB-STATE gives the state the whole job is currently in, one of
     `running', `suspended', or `done'. The MARK is `+' for the current
     job, `-' for the previous job and empty otherwise. This is
     followed by one `PID=STATE' for every process in the job. The PIDs
     are, of course, the process IDs and the STATE describes the state
     of that process.
