zsh-3.1.6-dev-21 is in the CVS repository, tagged.  Tags will continue
to be in Tanaka Akira's format, i.e replace .'s by _'s giving
zsh-3_1_6-dev-21, which is the natural way to do it.

It ought to be possible to send it automatically (or at least via a
script which just needs the version) to ftp.zsh.org, which will avoid
me sending it over a 56kbps telephone line from home.  In fact, we
should even be able to set up a cron job to look for new -dev- tags.
Here's the litany of problems so far.  Anyone with time on their hands
is very, very welcome to look at this.

- Adam set up a checked-out copy on sourceforge in
/home/groups/zsh/zsh (the last zsh is the top-level CVS project
directory).  I have updated this, and configured it to install under
/home/groups/zsh, so developers might want to use /home/groups/zsh/bin
in their path.  I had to install yodl here to get it to work.  This
should provide us for the first time with a common platform for
examining bugs, so it should be kept up to date by anyone using it.  I
suggest using `umask 002' here.  I haven't checked our quota; I don't
know if we're going to run into difficulties doing this.  The first
problem is with `make targz-src': having multiple owners of files in
the distrib directory messes this up.  Improvement of
Util/mkdisttree.sh could fix this.

- There's no pgp evident on sourceforge.  This is the sort of thing I
don't want to sneak in because of possible legal difficulties.  pgp is
currently required for sending updates to ftp.zsh.org.  I don't have
my current key at work so can't send it from here (which is my problem,
but this isn't an option for the long term anyway).

Geoff, can you think of a simple, fairly automated way of getting
something from sourceforge into ftp.zsh.org?  I can't imagine this is
going to be too hard...  By the way, gcw is now in the zsh developer's
group.  I still can't get into `change developer permissions'.

Oliver, if you're interested in maintaining web pages, we could do
with something basic on sourceforge, so if you want to register, Adam
or I can add you as a developer.  Links to the other zsh websites and
to some zsh resources within sourceforge would be useful, though
there's no reason why this shouldn't all be available at
sunsite.auc.dk (some of it obviously already is).  The current general
web page (rather than the sourceforge-specific stuff) is just a
placeholder.  I don't think there's any arrangement for CVS handling
of web pages at sourceforge.

I haven't even looked at the anon FTP stuff at sourceforge yet.
