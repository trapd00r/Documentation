Right; "select" only reprints the select list when the user seems to be 
confused about the possible choices.  It has no way of knowing what the
state of the screen is.

Not directly with only select.  You can of course do this:

  while some suitable condition
  do
    select ITEM in 1 2 3 4
    do
      a thing that wipes the screen
      break
    done
  done
