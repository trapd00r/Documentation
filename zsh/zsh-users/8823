If you haven't tried it in a while, be sure to re-test to make sure that
something didn't change recently.  I ran into an ident delay a while
back, and fixed it by opening a hole in my firewall to a machine on my
local network, even though it wasn't running identd -- that made the
reverse ident attempt immediately fail (with a connection refused)
instead of hanging for a bit, waiting to timeout.
