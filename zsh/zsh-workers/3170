Hi All,

One of the zle functions 'complete-or-expand-prefix' no longer
works. I added this a while back and used it. After a couple
of job changes I lost it from my zshrc file. So the short story
is that I dont know when it broke but it is (at least for me -
Solaris 2.4 on a Sparc).

The good news is that the option COMPLETE_IN_WORD causes completion
to do what 'complete-or-expand-prefix' was meant to do, i.e. complete
words up to the cursor rather than to the end of the word.

There are 2 options:
	1. I can fix 'complete-or-expand-prefix' (I have a patch) or
	2. delete 'complete-or-expand-prefix' completely.

Im happy with either - do we want backward compatibilty?

			Anthony.
