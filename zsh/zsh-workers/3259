Hi!

Seems this (Peter's ) patch not fix 100% problem, becouse after
applying it the same problem (stty and bakground jobs) still
happed rundomly or   after working some time;
I cannot catch the moment where my stty goes bad.
( all talks about 3.1.2 )

BTW. IMHO
This happed becouse from 3.1.1 to 3.1.2 was long time of programming
and not 100 users testing. may be need to produce alphas-betas 
more often with some (not 100) bug fix in it ?
