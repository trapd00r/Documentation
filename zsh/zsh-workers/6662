It's easy to implement (and indeed my suggestion for aliases does that 
-- although I didn't really like it when I wrote it). The problem this 
always leads to is quoting: if you want to pass the string `$foo' to a 
widget you don't want the shell to expand it.

Anyway, we could add a automatic-autoloading mechanism for widgets,
too, making defining them simple.
