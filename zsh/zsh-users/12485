There is a misunderstanding.  By "end the session", I meant ending a
session and removing all data associated with it.  An analogy would be
the option not to save the tabs in a web browser when closing it.
Saving the session state would be the default behavior which would
occur when logging out of the X session or closing the shell by
sending SIGHUP for example.

Regards,
Robert.
