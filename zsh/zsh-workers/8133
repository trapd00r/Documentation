        What if there were some well defined mechanism for packaging a 
(for lack of a better term) zsh add-on.  Something sort of similar to
the CPAN.pm module for perl (for those not familiar with perl, CPAN is 
the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network and CPAN.pm is a module that
will automagically download, compile, and install additional perl
modules).  This hypothetical program could be pointed at an
apropriately structured http/ftp site (part of the hypothetical
Comprehensive Zsh ARchive, or CZAR :) and told to grab and install J.
Random Hax0r's k-R4d shell prompts or the most up to date zftp module
source.

        Or maybe that's overkill. :)

        At the minimum, if there's going to be separately packaged
components something like the glib/gtk+/gnome x-config scripts would
be nice (again for those not familiar, these packages ship with a
shell script that is installed in $(installdir)/bin that can be run to 
get compile and link options suitable for linking against the library
in question).  After market zsh addins could use zsh-config to find
the location of the Functions directory, or headers for compiling
loadable modules against, or what not.

        Just some random thoughts.
