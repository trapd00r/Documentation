Hmm... it might be more portable to use ${SHELL} instead of dot anyway.
The script is written to be self-contained.

Yes, that will need fixing with the reset of the curses stuff.

I already checked that, and it should be set by AC_INIT. (We don't use
all the parameters from that, but the package name comes from the first
which is `zsh'.  Using more parameters is a pain because the second
argument is a version.)  So I don't think this is our problem.
