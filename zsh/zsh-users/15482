I want to on the commandline write some text to guide a task. Then I 
can go like pushline with <esc>-q to move it away and work on my task. 
Then to bring back the "scratchpad" for reading or editing, I go 
<cntrl>-C.

But I could forget to pushline the scratchpad text again and 
just <cntrl>-c it away.

Is there a way to make this "scratchpad"  unlosable, like possibly 
writing it to the history or something even more weird and useful?
