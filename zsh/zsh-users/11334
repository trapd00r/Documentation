Perfect!  (Sorry, Bart, for dismissing your previous patch.  I didn't
realize the completion code was in plain text on my system and not in
some compiled form.)  My version didn't look exactly like this, but
tacking the "&& return" onto the end of the two _combination commands
does the trick.  It looks like those were the only two lines that
changed.

Thanks so much, Peter!
