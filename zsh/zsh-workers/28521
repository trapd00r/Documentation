Hm, I thought we had some functions like that already.  Perhaps that
was in an earlier version.  I will look into using this.  Let=E2=80=99s hop=
e
libgit2 finally arrives and someone (OK, I) implement zgit so that we
don=E2=80=99t have to do so much forking (think Cygwin).

OK, good.  We can have a look at that subdivision later (because I
think it=E2=80=99s desirable, especially for _git-add).

Thanks.  I=E2=80=99m sorry that it=E2=80=99s taking so long, but I want to =
clean it
all up so that future revisions will be easier to make.

Yes, although it=E2=80=99s slightly redundant.  _git-* is completion for gi=
t
*.  __git_* is an internal helper function.
