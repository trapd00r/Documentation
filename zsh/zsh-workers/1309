Actually POSIX says that

with no arguments test should exit with status 1. 

With 1 argument it should exit true iff that argument is non-null (this
means that `test -n' and `test -z' both exit true).  

With 2 arguments: if $1 is a bang `!' exit true iff $2 is null.  If $1 is
an unary operator, exit true iff the unary test is true.

etc.

I'll modify zsh according to this.
