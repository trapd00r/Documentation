Well, it seems that according to this doc shells called es and rc has some
features, that zsh does not have:

http://www.faqs.org/faqs/unix-faq/shell/shell-differences/

                               zsh  rc   es
Low level command redefinition N    N    Y
Has anonymous functions        N    Y    Y
Lexically scoped variables     N    N    Y
Exceptions                     N    N    Y

But is that true? Or is that document outdated? If that document is right,
what and when you zsh-developers are going to do to rectify situation?
