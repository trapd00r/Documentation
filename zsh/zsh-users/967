This wouldn't work anyway.

Aliases aren't interpreted until command execution, which doesn't happen
until you hit return.  What you want is "bindkey -s".

What it looks like would depend on what editor you were using.  If it's
the zsh line editor, it "looks" like ^L, but you type <ctrl-V><ctrl-L>
to insert one.  You can't type the two characters `^' and `L' and have
them be interpreted as <ctrl-L>.  The <ctrl-V> means "intepret the next
thing I type as simple input, even if it would otherwise be an editor
command."  That's what I mean by "put the characters in as themselves."

Characters entered in this way normally should be part of a quoted string.

Same way.

Shell functions.

You definitely want "bindkey -s".
