Same problem here:

  zsh> TERM=xterm
  zsh> TERM=xterm-color
  (I guess I'm luky here..)
  zsh> TERM=color_xterm
  zsh: can't find termcap info for color_xterm
  zsh> TERM=rxvt
  zsh: can't find termcap info for rxvt

How to make zsh use TERMINFO (on SunOS 5.8)?
Directory /usr/share/lib/terminfo exists
but apparently has NO entry for rxvt.

Mind you, this system has just been installed
and is missing a compiler, an up-to-date vim,
and an up-to-date zsh.  *sigh*

So my goal is to install an up-todate zsh in ~/bin
(which I exec from my /bin/csh login - dont ask)
and then getting it to work with my ~/.terminfo.

Suggestions?
