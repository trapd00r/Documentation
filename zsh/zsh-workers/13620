} Shouldn't the function be using $service instead of ${words[0]:t}?

I went back and forth on that one.  Using $service would mean that some
other command wanted to read ncftp's (or lftp's) bookmarks file, rather
than having its own with a similar format.  I concluded that wasn't
likely; but maybe the other way would in fact be better.
