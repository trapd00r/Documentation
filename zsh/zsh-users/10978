Unfortunately the substitution is in the other order: the PROMPT_SUBST
replacement of variables comes before % substitution, so this scheme
wouldn't work.

This is close to working: the problem is the double quotes.  This forces
the parameter expansion and command substitution to be performed
during the assignment.  If you run 'print -r -- $p_apm' while changing
psvar you'll see it outputs the same fixed string.  The %'s get
substituted later, but that's not good enough.

However, given that you have PROMPT_SUBST set you don't need to rely on
% substitution at all for the array subscript:

p_apm='%{${fg_no_bold[$psvar[3]]}%}%(2v.*%2v.) '

should do what you want.
