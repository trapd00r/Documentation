     There's a much simpler formulation that works the same (AFAIK) in all
     versions that have the (l) (that's a lowercase L) parameter flag:
     
     	echo -ne "\e]1;${(l:rlength:)tab_label}\a"
     
This works great.  Thanks. The parameter flags have always been a major 
source of confusion for me.
