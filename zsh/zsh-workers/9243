It's something else though similar enough that I thought I could adapt
the pattern to work for either. I'll probably now just use separate code
for AIX.

I had a look IRIX (5.3 only) yesterday evening and it seems that the
best way to get a list of printers there is by running lpstat -v. The
same command on AIX (and HP/UX I expect) will also work but gives very
different output so I'll probably have to check $OSTYPE for IRIX
handling.
