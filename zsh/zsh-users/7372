Question:  Does it harm anything to include quotes when they aren't
needed?

goo() {
  w3m "http://www.google.com/search?q=${(j:+:)${(qqq)@}}&num=100"
}

With that def'n, the command

	goo "foo bar" baz

calls w3m on a URL that looks like

	http://www.google.com/search?q="foo bar"+"baz"&num=100

where the quotes around "baz" are extraneous but (I think) harmless.

Note though that also with that def'n the command

	goo 'foo " bar'

produces the URL

	http://www.google.com/search?q="foo \" bar"&num=100

in which the backslash may not do what you want.
