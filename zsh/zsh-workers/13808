} Yes, sounds very familiar.  I don't remember exactly and since I don't 
} use anything I could complete with _mailboxes I can't easily try, but
} normally that's because one of the expansions leaves an empty element
} in an array.

I've looked through _complete_debug output and not managed to find any
cases where `compadd' is called with an array containing an empty element.

However, at _multi_parts line 164-166, the expression

	"${(@)${(@M)matches:#*${sep}}%%${sep}*}"

expands to the empty string.  Could that be the source of the problem?
