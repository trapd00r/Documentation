A couple of queries on suffixes & completion:

1) If I am completing variable assignments on the command line, eg:

MODULE=value
      ^

and I complete after the 'E', on the '=', it does nothing. Is there
any way to configure the system to make it complete to MODULE_PATH
as might be expected?

2) If completing the above line using the following in the completor:

compset -S '=value'

then 'MODULE' will be successfully completed to 'MODULE_PATH', but the
cursor will be left after value. Is there any way to keep the cursor
after 'MODULE_PATH', which is what was completed? (Or even after the
'=', given the automatic suffix which would have been inserted had
value not been there.)

Cheers,

Martin.
