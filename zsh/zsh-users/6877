Subject: kill-word removes whole line

I have a problem with alt-d (kill-word): it removes the whole line!

If I have this, with prompt at *:

foo * bar bar bar

and press alt-d, all three "bar" are removed from the command-line. I
would expect only the first to be removed.

All other "word actions" such as forward-word, and backward-kill-word,
work as I expect.

This is zsh 4.1.1 on Debian. I don't know if it matters, but I have these
lines in my .zshrc:

autoload -U select-word-style
select-word-style bash

TIA,

Jesper
