This is caused by hashdirs() skipping directories for which isrelative()
returns true.  It's entirely possible that isrelative() should not return
true for /absolute/../rest; but as of this writing, it does.

} In contrast, bin_whence likes it just fine.

That's because bin_whence() calls findcmd(), which does a direct search
of the path without using hashdirs().  The completion system always uses
the hash tables, and is therefore at the mercy of the HASH_* setopts.
