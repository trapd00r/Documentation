Well, I think this would be the best way:

:0Dw	
*  ^TOzsh@peak\.org
*  ^Subject:[ 	]PATCH
* !^Subject:.* -reply
|email2html

What that basically says, if you can't read procmail, is:

If the message is 'To:' or 'CC:' to zsh@peak.org and the Subject begins with  
an UPPERCASE 'PATCH' (with only a space or tab before the word PATCH) and  
the Subject does not end with ' -reply' (to avoid those nasty Novell people)  
then pipe the message to the email2html program (actually called hypermail).

I'll try to set this up tonight for a beta test.
