Dear list,

I just changed my default shell from bash to zsh and I haven't regretted
it so far. There's only one thing that comes to my mind every now and
then:

Is it possible, that command completion only completes on commands that
are actually executable? As it happens I have to work on machines that
have non-executables in directories in $PATH.

I already tried something like

zstyle ':completion:*:complete:-command-::commands' ignored-patterns '*(f:u-x:)'

but it didn't work.

Cheers,
    eike
