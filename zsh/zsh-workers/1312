I like this, the problem is, for this to be really useful we need:

  if [ "$a" = "-s" ] ; then echo "hi" > = ; fi
  if [ "$a" = "-s" ] ; then echo "yeh" ; fi

  But the first if fails .... :-)

  Joking aside, this may be correct, but it kind of fails the "gee whiz"
  behaviour test. I suppose one would use a 'case' statement.

  What is the "preferred" way of testing strings that may be arbitrarily
  input then given the above ? I mean one does not know what 'a' is until
  you do a test on it right ?
