copy-earlier-word is also nice, it picks earlier words each time you
press it, so the first press gives
cp verylongname.tex backup_backup_
and the second gives
cp verylongname.tex backup_verylongname.tex
It also works in conjunction with insert-last-word to pick earlier
words in earlier words more interactively than typing numbers.
Some of these may need autoloading and binding, I don't remember which
are on by default :).
