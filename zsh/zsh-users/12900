I don't think anyone is offended, but a good zshrc has grown over months
and years. Also, there is no way of knowing what you consider cool and
what you consider annoying. Additionally, posting your zshrc would help.

I can offer you my zshrc which has 1219 lines, free of charge. Of course,
if you want to spend money, I, and possibly a few others on this list who
also have great zshrc files you can steal from/take over completely, do
have an amazon wishlist and a paypal account ;)

PS: If I were you, I would buy From Bash to Z Shell with that money :)
