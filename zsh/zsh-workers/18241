Subject: use of `expand suffix' style in _multi_parts
Date: Fri, 14 Feb 2003 12:58:23 +0000
Message-ID: <2098.1045227503@csr.com>
From: Peter Stephenson <pws@csr.com>

Completing directories after

  tar xvzf file.tar.gz HERE/

with the `expand' style set to include `suffix' is inconvenient as it
appends a space after the slash when completing the directory HERE.
This is obviously wrong --- there is no reason to do anything other than
normal file completion at this point, irrespective of styles.

I can fix this by setting `expand' specially for the tar command, of course.
However, it needs fixing more generally.  Unfortunately I can't work out
what's actually wrong.  The culprit is _multi_parts where the style is
tested.  Is this wrong, is the compadd on the next line (which uses the
options passed rather than the separator passed) warong, is _tar wrong,
in any case what needs changing?

Any views whatsoever are solicited.
