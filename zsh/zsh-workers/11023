Subject: _complete_help vs. the matcher-list style
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

If you have a matcher-list style, using _complete_help causes any completion
function that uses that style to be called once for each match-spec in the
style.  (I noticed this while working on a variant of _complete_debug.)

I believe this is because _complete_help redefines compadd to always fail.
Nevertheless it's a bit of a pain, as no additional context information is
obtained by trying the other matchers.
