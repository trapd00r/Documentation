Unfortnately it can't work quite that way.  Perl does a *lot* more
semantic analysis when first translating a script into its internal
compiled form than is practical for any Bourne-shell-like shell to
perform.  The shell language defintion and variable scoping rules
are not themselves strict enough to support "compile time" checking.

If you need that, write your scripts in a language that has it.
