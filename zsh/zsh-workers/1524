Only the last command of a pipe runs in the current shell environment, and
in a subshell monitor is turned off.

But as it already turned out this behaviour was caused by the swap between
-1 and -C.  Every other Bourne-style shell uses -C for noclobber.  It would
be possible to use -C for noclobber only when zsh is invoked as sh/ksh but
that may cause confusion so I decided to make -C noclobber even is zsh
mode.  In zsh scripts only option names shoud be used to turn options
on/off.  Option names will not change and this will make the script more
readable.
