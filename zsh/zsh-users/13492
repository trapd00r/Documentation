"sudo", by default, doesn't start a root shell, and therefore doesn't
run shell rc's by default.  You can force it to, of course, with
something like "sudo -s", but that's not the right way to get a root
shell using sudo; you should instead use 'sudo -i' - which changes
$HOME and runs the shell specified for the user being switched to in
/etc/passwd...  And there's no loss of security from allowing users to
change to the root account with their own password; though of course
sudo can be configured to use the root password instead of the user
password...
