} Somehow the Makefile calls the recursive `make's twice when collection
} the module object files to be put into stamp-modobjs.

I've seen this as well (on linux, where it doesn't actually cause the
build to fail), and spent a little while trying to figure out why it was
happening, but I got lost in the twisty little maze of shell scripts
that create .in files that create makefiles that run shell scripts, and
gave up.
