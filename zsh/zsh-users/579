It depends on the binary format.  For example elf binaries (which is the
standard binary format on SVR4, Solaris and Linux) can be stripped
whithout loosing dynamic loading capabilities.  On the other hand SunOS 4
cannot export symbols to modules if binaries are stripped.  But that's only
for zsh-3.1.
