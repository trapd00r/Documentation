I've uploaded

ftp://ftp.zsh.org/pub/development/zsh-4.3.4-dev-6.tar.gz

This isn't very different from 4.3.4-dev-5, although it
should now pass all tests under Solaris.  It won't be very different
from 4.3.5, either, but I'm about to be on holiday for two weeks and if
there's a chance of fixing an easy-to-reproduce crash in the editor it's
probably worth waiting.
