Correct me if I'm wrong, but this is going to break zcompiled scripts
that were created with earlier versions of the shell.

Not that you need to avoid that, but it might be worth explicitly
calling out if true, and also bump the ZSH_VERSION number so it's
detectable at run time.

Or you could just put OutangProc at the end rather than renumbering
any of the existing tokens (I think).  Again I may be misguided.
