I've just been playing with time-stamped history items, and I noticed an
annoying side-effect of PUSHD_IGNORE_DUPS.  The timestamp in the history
reflects the *first* time the duplicated command was executed; I think it
would be much more useful for it to record the *most recent* time that
command was executed.

Didn't the history patch that Peter posted some while back do this?  What
ever became of that patch WRT the baseline?
