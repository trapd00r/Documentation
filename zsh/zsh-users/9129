I knew there was a flag like that but I couldn't find it offhand.

I used xargs so rm would never be called without arguments, avoiding this
problem. But your solution is a little more flexible, e.g. you could emit a
message depending on whether any files will be/were removed:

    deadlogs=(~/log/**/*.log(m+7,N))
    if (( $#deadlogs == 0 ))
    then
	echo "No longs removed."
    else
	rm $deadlogs
	echo "$#deadlogs logs removed."
    fi
