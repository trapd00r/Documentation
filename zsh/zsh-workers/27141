} It seems to me it should one thing or the other---either have job
} control in the shell with its own separate job table, or report the
} parent's.  A mixture is madness.

I agree with *that*, but I'm wondering if the end result is that the
POSIX spec is self-contradictory [it wouldn't be the first time].

} Yuk.  So you've got a real job you can manipulate, and one phantom job
} from the parent shell you can't and which is presumably fixed like that
} for eternity.

No, actually, you have two jobs neither of which you can manipulate.
PDKSH doesn't do job control in subshells.  It turns off -m when the
subshell starts, and silently ignores it if you manually turn it back
on again.
