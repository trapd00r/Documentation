No, you misunderstand.  With autolist+listambiguous, zsh will first
complete as far as it can, and then stop -- you have to press TAB again
to see the list of possible completions.

This patch is intended to cause zsh to immediately display the list any
time it can't complete to a unique match, even if it can complete part of
the way.

However, this can be done in the new completion system without having to
change the C code by assigning compstate[list]=list at some appropriate
place.  I don't have time to figure out exactly where, at the moment ...
