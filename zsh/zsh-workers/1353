Heyla,
  This was with beta20-test1: I haven't patched with messages 1328/1329.
I can't reproduce this at the moment (and my histsize is only 750 so it's
gone off the top)
This is with different combinations using ^Z, bg, fg, and &.

% sleep 1000
^Z
% sleep 1000
^Z
% bg %2
% fg %1
^Z
% jobs
[1] suspended sleep 1000         <--- from memory/guess/what it should be
[2] running   sleep 1000
[3] suspended fg %1              <--- yeh?
%

Not the most desirable situation.  Didn't occur with only one job.
