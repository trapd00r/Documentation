I have been trying to compile dev-22 on Solaris 2.7 with both gcc 2.81, and
gcc 2.95.2, and failing in the same place on both.  

It's a strait gtar -xzf zsh*.gz ; cd zsh<tab> ; ./configure ; make.

The error I'm getting is:

gcc -c -I. -D_LARGEFILE_SOURCE -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -Wall -Wno-implicit -Wmissing-prototypes -O2  -o hashtable.o hashtable.c
hashtable.c: In function `add_userdir':
hashtable.c:1191: structure has no member named `en_cols'
make[2]: *** [hashtable.o] Error 1
make[2]: Leaving directory `/export/home/jprice/programs/zsh/zsh-3.1.6-dev-22/Src'
make[1]: *** [modobjs] Error 2
make[1]: Leaving directory `/export/home/jprice/programs/zsh/zsh-3.1.6-dev-22/Src'
make: *** [all] Error 1

If I need to give more info, please let me know.

Solaris 2.7, 128 m ram, ultra 1, 167 MHz.  To the best of my knowledge,
it's a strait 2.7 machine.  I havn't torched it, and re-installed to verify
it though...
