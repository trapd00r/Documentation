Oh, of course.  I was thinking only of UTF-8 again.

Not sure, as I haven't actually tried it, and I don't have any non-ascii
keys on my keyboard to try it anyway, but from my reading of the xterm man
page (version 205), it might be the case that it can distinguish between
eight-bit characters and key combinations M-<x> (the description in
metaSendsEscape isn't clear, IMHO), and so setting both eightBitInput and
metaSendsEscape to true would allow eight-bit characters to be sent cleanly
to the terminal, and when you type M-<x>, xterm sends ESC-<x>.

You probably also need to set "utf8: true" or "locale: true" or "locale:
utf8" for multibyte character sets to work properly.

I'm sure Thomas could set the record straight here.
