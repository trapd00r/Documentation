It'd require some work.  It looks as if ange-ftp wants to send
standard FTP client commands, whereas zftp wants everything to
be prefixed with "zftp ", and I don't see a hook anywhere in
the ange-ftp lisp that would let you modify the commands sent.

So you'd have to create a wrapper around the zf* functions to
mimic the standard ftp command set, and even then I'm not very
confident that ange-ftp would be able parse the output.
