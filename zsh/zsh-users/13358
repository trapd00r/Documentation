In case you hadn't noticed, after some help from Geoff, I've uploaded

ftp://ftp.zsh.org/pub/development/zsh-4.3.6-dev-2.tar.gz
ftp://ftp.zsh.org/pub/development/zsh-4.3.6-dev-2-doc.tar.gz

There are actually no configuration-specific changes sinces dev-1; the
major differences are to fix a few completion glitches that turned up.
Consequently if nothing else serious turns up I will release 4.3.7
shortly.
