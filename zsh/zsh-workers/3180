:"init.c" shows that each startup file from /etc is read only if the

:none is set by default. On the other hand, the INSTALL file (if I got it
:right) says that one has to explicitely _disable_ processing of a
:scriptfile by adding the option --disable-scriptname to 'configure',
:which suggests that GLOBAL_scriptname is set by default.

Unless you specify otherwise when you run configure, they're all set by
default in config.h . configure checks for --disable-whatever and
--enable-whatever=pathname  and if it finds neither it will give you defaults.

:What is the intention?

As it is.

:I'd prefer an implementation of the documented default behaviour.

It is.  What exactly leads you to believe they're unset by default?
