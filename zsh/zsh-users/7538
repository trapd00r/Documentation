One probably wouldn't, when interactively typing commands, unless one
wanted to use the special attributes such as padding, alignment, other
integer bases, or floating-point precision.

The primary time/place and reason to use typeset is when defining shell
functions, to create variables that are local to the function scope. When
you use "local" that's really an alias for typeset.
