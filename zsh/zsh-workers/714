... and very easily, too.  Ain't autoconf wonderful?

It is zsh-2.6-beta13.

I have a little problem with ls, though I guess it's more general.  Best 
explained by examples:

	$ ls -l -F			# okay
	$ A='-l'
	$ ls $A -F			# okay
	$ B='-l -F'
	$ ls $B				# error
					# BSD ls: "illegal option --"
					# GNU ls: "invalid option --"
	$ ls --8bit --color=tty -lF	# okay (GNU color ls)
	$ C='--8bit --color=tty'
	$ ls $C -lF		# unrecognized option `--8bit --color=tty'
				# (GNU color ls)

The problem does not appear with bash or tcsh.  It does appear with two 
varieties of ls with zsh.

The color ls works by assigning the variable LS_OPTIONS and using it in 
aliases.  It is set to "--8bit --color=<option>" by the program 
dircolors run in a shell startup file.
