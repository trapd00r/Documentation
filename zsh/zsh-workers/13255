Subject: Bug in zsh 3.0.8

I found the following bug in zsh 3.0.8 (I don't know if it exists in the
latest beta version, since i don't have it):

/home/nyh$ cat /tmp/z.z
echo $ZSH_VERSION
let 'a[3]=2'
let 'a[3]=2'
/home/nyh$ zsh /tmp/z.z
3.0.8
zsh: segmentation fault  zsh /tmp/z.z


I don't know what's wrong: had an array already been defined, stuff like
let 'a[3]++' works. So why can't let 'a[3]=2' work? Strangely, the first
let command doesn't crash (but it doesn't set a[3]!), and only the second
one crashes zsh.

Thanks,
	Nadav.
