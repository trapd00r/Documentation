Are you using 3.1.6 or 3.1.6-dev-19 or ...?

The problem is that @' was simply a quoted ' in makeinfo before some
fairly recent version (don't recall exactly which), when it changed to
become an introducer for some kind of international character support.
A patch appeared in zsh-workers/7414 and has been in the development
sources since 3.1.6-*-3.

Here again is that patch:
