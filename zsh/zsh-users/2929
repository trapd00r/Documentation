ssh falls back to rsh if there is no ssh on the remote host.
(if configured so)

Not necessarily: public keys in .ssh/authorized_keys is the better
alternative.

True, but not as expensive as opening a new shell, ssh-ing to the remote
machine and looking for the right path/filenames manually. :-)

I wouldn't call it lazy.  I guess there were and are more important things
to do.  And I wasn't saying that it is bad that zsh doesn't have this
functionality.  I was just asking whether someone on the list has done this 
already so that I don't have to start thinking myself.  So who is lazy? :-)

Using ssh with its fallback-to-rsh-option should be enough.  If that fails
a simple "remote host denies access" is sufficient, I would say.

Granted. :-)

Thanks,
 Andy.
