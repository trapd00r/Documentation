I once did a 'cd'-wrapper function, that also tries to do some basic
error correction (this is also on <http://zshwiki.org>):

[snip]
function smart_cd () {
  if [[ -f $1 ]] ; then
    [[ ! -e ${1:h} ]] && return 1
    print correcting ${1} to ${1:h}
    builtin cd ${1:h}
  else
    builtin cd ${1}
  fi
}

function cd () {
  setopt localoptions
  setopt extendedglob
  local approx1 ; approx1=()
  local approx2 ; approx2=()
  if (( ${#*} == 0 )) || [[ ${1} = [+-]* ]] ; then
    builtin cd "$@"
  elif (( ${#*} == 1 )) ; then
    approx1=( (#a1)${1}(N) )
    approx2=( (#a2)${1}(N) )
    if [[ -e ${1} ]] ; then
      smart_cd ${1}
    elif [[ ${#approx1} -eq 1 ]] ; then
      print correcting ${1} to ${approx1[1]}
      smart_cd ${approx1[1]}
    elif [[ ${#approx2} -eq 1 ]] ; then
      print correcting ${1} to ${approx2[1]}
      smart_cd ${approx2[1]}
    else
      print couldn\'t correct ${1}
    fi
  elif (( ${#*} == 2 )) ; then
    builtin cd $1 $2
  else
    print cd: too many arguments
  fi
}
