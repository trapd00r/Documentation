I've uploaded 4.2.0-pre-2 to ftp.zsh.org with some minor fixes.

Problems which came up were.

- Apparently failed to compile on a Fedora system without ncurses-devel.
I don't know if termcap was also missing, but if it was that would
explain it.  I don't think we need to do anything.

- AIX is weird.  That's not really a zsh problem, but it failed to
compile owing to an error in init.c.  There was also an awk
problem in AIX 5 which wasn't due to zsh, but I've tried to work around
it.  I don't know if it works yet.

- In some configurations, linking against libpcre.so was a bad idea
because it wasn't available at boot.  You now need to --enable-pcre.
Clint has a better fix for future versions.

When there are no more compilation problems I will release it.
