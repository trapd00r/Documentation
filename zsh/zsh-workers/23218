Hi all,

zsh seems to be affected by infamous Turkish locale (LC_ALL=3Dtr_TR.UTF-8)=
=20
problem. In Turkish lowercase of "I" is not i but its =C4=B1 (i-dotless). A=
nd this=20
seems to affect zsh too :

[~]> zsh --version
zsh 4.3.2-dev-1 (i686-pc-linux-gnu)

[~]> setopt SHARE_HISTORY
setopt: no such option: SHARE_HISTORY

[~]> setopt share_history
[~]>

As you can see any option having "I" in it won't work on Turkish. I reprodu=
ced=20
the problem with zsh 4.3.2 and latest CVS.

Regards.
