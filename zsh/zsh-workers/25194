Changing the type of $path in ~/.zshenv, that is for all zsh
shells (including script interpreters) that this user may run
seems dangerous to me.

Some scripts might expect $path[-1] to be the last component
that they added for instance.

Like:

path+=("$(some-cmd)") && print -ru2 just added $path[-1] to PATH

If something changed the type of $path behind its back, then the
above won't work correctly.
