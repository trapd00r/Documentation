Subject: 3.1.9-dev-6 completion problem: `a | b`
Mime-Version: 1.0 (generated by tm-edit 7.106)
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII


If I say any of the following:

a | TAB
`TAB
a; TAB
`a; TAB

I get a list of commands.  However, if I say

`a | TAB

I get a list of files.  In fact, even if I say

`a | junkTAB

I get a list of files.  I haven't studied the code enough to know what
the problem is.  Changing ` to $( in all above cases does not change
the behavior.
