[snip]

Only one more thing.. I used to include a command in my prompt, that displayed
the number of background processes running I got the number with the following
command:
jobs | wc -l | tr -d " "
but in zsh wc does not seem to get any input:
$ jobs
[1]  - suspended  mc
[3]  + suspended  mc

$ jobs | wc -l
      0

Where in bash I get this:
$ jobs
[1]-  Stopped                 /usr/bin/mc $*
[2]+  Stopped                 /usr/bin/mc $*

$ jobs | wc -l
      2

This is a bug, surely?
