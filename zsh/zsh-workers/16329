Isn't most of this the same as _netscape. And if _netscape was updated
for netscape 6.2 would there be any difference at all between them?

What I'd suggest is that we don't have a separate _mozilla but merge
these changes into _netscape. Should we still be supporting netscape 4
in _netscape at all? If so we can probably just look for the
user-preference directory (.netscape or .netscape6) to decide quickly
which set of options to complete.

Does mozilla still accept all the GTK options? We probably need an
_gtk_arguments function really.

Oliver
