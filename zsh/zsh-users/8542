I already solved it. Problem was slash at end of path. This is is 
possibly a bug in zsh, but in any case it can be used as hack to get 
behaviour you stated bellow:

> export UTILDIR=/a/b/c
> export ud=$UTILDIR

If I write that in a little bit different way:

export UTILDIR="/a/b/c"
export ud="$UTILDIR/"

Now you can use both with cd-command, but %~ expands to UTILDIR not ud, 
because of slash at end of ud.
