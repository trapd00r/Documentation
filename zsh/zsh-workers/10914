Yes. And it does for me... i.e. the string doesn't just vanish,
neither with my setup nor with `zsh -f'. Could you...


A different question is whether menu-selection shouldn't exit when
a-a-i-n-h yields no matches. I've thinking about this for quite some
time, but couldn't find a good solution for what to do when this
happens.
