(...and print.) Yes, I wanted to do it in exactly this way, when I
discovered the old `o' modifier. I also thought about altering the
name of the `o' modifier.

This would also reverse the meaning of the `O' qualifier.

But since `o' wasn't documented and `O' is new, it hopefully wouldn't
cause too much trouble.
