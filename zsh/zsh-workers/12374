Subject: Whither _compdir ?  (compinit, 3.1.9-dev-3)
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

At line 326, compinit tests [[ $_compdir = */Core || -d $_compdir/Core ]],
but _compdir is neither defined (local or typeset) nor assigned-to yet at
that point.  This means that the directory Core in the root filesystem is
being checked, which is certainly wrong.

In compinstall the parameter compdir is set (note not leading underscore),
but that wouldn't seem to be related.

What the devil is supposed to be happening here?  Where is _compdir meant
to come from?
