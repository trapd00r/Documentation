Subject: outputting quotes in a command
Message-ID: <20071204124228.GA31450@fruitcom.com>
MIME-Version: 1.0

User-Agent: Mutt/1.5.12-2006-07-14

I want to output from a script the following command
(obviously where I will have foo bar as variables).

 $  mutt -f foo -e 'push "<limit> ~f bar ~d <2w^M"'
Where ^M represents a carriage return

I cannot reproduce the quoting in the attempts i have made with
backslasing.

How would I achieve this?
