} Just add it to xmods.conf.

Ah, OK ... and duh.

} (I don't understand this name, btw.)

I think the x is for "extension."  (But why isn't modules-bltn called
"bmods.conf" or something?  Maybe we should clean all this up, too.)

Here's another question:

zagzig% zmodload -ac  
post after (compctl)
post between (compctl)
post suffix (compctl)
post prefix (compctl)
zagzig% zmodload -uc compctl after
zmodload: compctl: no such condition
zagzig% zmodload -ac
post between (compctl)
post suffix (compctl)
post prefix (compctl)
zagzig% zmodload -uc compctl between || echo Failed
zmodload: compctl: no such condition
Failed
zagzig% zmodload -ac
post suffix (compctl)
post prefix (compctl)

Is is really the right behavior that zmodload go on and unload the rest
of the conditions listed on the command line after one has failed?  Or
should it stop when it gets to a failure?  I suppose the analogy is to
"rm", but I was a bit surprised by it.
