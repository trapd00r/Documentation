Could you explain what "getting vim keybindings" means?

Do you mean that ZLE behaves entirely like vi, or do you mean that
somehow keys in the emacs mode are becoming bound to vim-like sequences?

On the presumption that it's the former:

Are any of those variables named EDITOR or VISUAL, by any chance?

If EDITOR or VISUAL contains the substring "vi", then ZLE starts up with
the vi mode bindings, otherwise it starts up with emacs mode.
