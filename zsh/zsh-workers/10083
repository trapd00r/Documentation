} After a quick look at some man pages, it seems that Linux maybe doesn't
} have faccessx(). Is this right? Is there an alternative? Does anyone
} know if there are any platforms which don't have faccessx

I found the following on a Google-cached copy of a web page about hacking
into linux systems by exploiting "find ... -exec rm {} \;" as run by cron.
It would appear that faccess() and faccessx() [and by extension probably
accessx() as well] are strictly IBM-isms.
