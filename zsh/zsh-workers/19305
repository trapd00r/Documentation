Where?

I can't find it anywhere in _files and if it is in _path_files then it
doesn't work. Try: _foo() { _files -g '*.gz(.)(.)' }

So either we need to add #q when using glob qualifiers or _files should
attempt to merge trailing glob qualifiers. I favour the latter.

So _files needs to match a trailing glob qualifier in the parameter to
-g and stick #q in. Can a glob qualifier contain quoted parenthesis?
