    Hi all :)

    I have this in a script, after parsing command line arguments:

    [[ $OPTARG -lt 8 ]] && OPTARG=8

    If I call the script like this:

    $ ./script -o --

    then $OPTARG is "--" and that gives a "bad math expression" in
the test above.

    How can I solve this? Must I validate $OPTARG before messing with
it on a math expression? Is this validation enough?:

    [[ "OPTARG" = [[:digit:]]## ]]

    Can I do a more clever validation?

    Thanks a lot in advance :)
