Hi all,

I created a directory with 100000 files to test the new htree patch for the
ext3 filesystem, and found a ¿bug? when I tried to remove all the files.
The command 'rm *' gave the error 'zsh: argument list too long'. If expansion
doesn't support so many parameters, what it's the supossed way to remove all
these files without deleting the directory?

thanks,
