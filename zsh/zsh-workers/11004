;-) I didn't reply to Andrej's reply to my mail because I had a look
at pattern.c after that and found the same.

And no, I've never seen that behaviour myself, but I don't use locales 
anyway, so... The only thing that's really still there is the call to
strcoll() in the sorting function in glob.c.

Personally I don't care about conformance to any standard (in this
respect, at least) or compatibility to other shells. I just wanted say 
that /if/ we do it, we should make it configurable and shouldn't make
it the default.
