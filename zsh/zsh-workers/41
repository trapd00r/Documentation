A couple of the zsh mirror sites are not
mirroring some of the files in the main
archive.  I noticed that the META-FAQ is
not propagating to some of the mirror sites,
and that some of the sites had older copies
of the FAQ.  If you are running a mirror site,
could you please check to make sure everything
is working ok.

I can't seem to find the contact addresses for
people running the mirror sites.  If you are
running one, could you please send a message
so I can collect this information.

Thanks,

Richard Coleman
