 "which completion function are used for aliases?" (Mar 25,  1:08am)

} When completing the options of an alias, is there a way to make zsh
} use the completion function of the corresponding command?

It should just happen.  What's your setting of the "complete_aliases"
setopt?  Try "unsetopt complete_aliases".  The name of the option is
somewhat ambiguous -- it means "complete aliases as separate commands
and not as the command for which they are another name."
