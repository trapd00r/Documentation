That happened first time ... but I figured it out.

It tried both(of course trying to do \Cv ESC \Cy is not such a good ideea
because ESC will be shown and \Cy will be interpreted as a command(if it is
binded)) and the echo is


I think that the right one is "". Though if I type \Cv \My the echo
is:
y
which makes me to belive that my alt key is working ok(by prefixing the
key with an escape char).

I'm puzzled :)
