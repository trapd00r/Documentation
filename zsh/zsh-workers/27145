} Why does zsh 4.3.10 behave differently?

Hmm.  There was a change to trap handling, but that should only matter
if LOCAL_TRAPS is set.  I also wanted there to have been some change
related to configure detecting restartable syscalls, but I can't find
anything in the ChangeLog about that.

IMO 4.3.10 has got it right and the older zsh et al. do not.

I'm not so sure.  You can emulate WCE with WUE and a trap, but there is
no way to make WCE do the right thing in the case of an ill-behaved
child that does not propagate the signal state through exit status.
