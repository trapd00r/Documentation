I've had an idea at the weekend, but don't know if this is possible
with a (remote) CVS server, so I'll have to ask some questions...

Using `loginfo', it should be possible to make the CVS server give out 
numbers for the patches, err... for the commits. If the program
executed from loginfo prints something, will that be displayed on the
terminal where one does the commit? With a local repository this seems 
to work. If it works with remote CVS, too, we probably could make the
loginfo-program get the number and print, at the end of the
commit-output (or somewhere in-between), something like `Commit number xxx'.

Next question: could loginfo (or some of the other automatically
executed things) append that number to the log-message given to the
commit? So that we also have the number in the messages stored in the
repository.

And finally, if all the above works, the CVS server has the
log-message from the user, the patch number and it knows the changed
files, so: could it change ChangeLog automatically?


Is any or all of this possible?

Bye
 Sven
