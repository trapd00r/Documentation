Subject: Stopping completion from using $cdpath

Is there a way to stop zsh from using $cdpath when doing completion ? If I
have a directory with only one sub-directory and I do

cd <TAB>

it tries to complete from $cdpath instead of directly going into the
sub-directory. If I unset cdpath, it works fine...

Thanks,
