<H1 ID="SC"><SPAN CLASS="chapnum">C</SPAN><BR>Communication</H1>
<P>This appendix provides information on how the VT420 communicates with
a host computer, printer, or modem. The appendix shows the cables you
can use for different system configuration. It describes how XON and
XOFF characters help control data flow. The last section describes the
signals carried by the connectors on the rear of the terminal.</P>
<P>The terminal operates on full-duplex asynchronous lines only, with 10
possible transmit and receive speeds. You can use split transmit and
receive speeds, but you must use the same speeds as your host system
and printer.</P>
<P>To match your host system's speed, use the Communications Set-Up
screen (<A HREF="chapter5.html">Chapter 5</A>). To match your printer's speed, use the Printer Set-Up
screen (<A HREF="chapter8.html">Chapter 8</A>).</P>
<P>For more information on communication, see the <CITE>VT420 Programmer
Reference Manual</CITE>.</P>
<H2 ID="SC.1">Cables</H2>
<P>You can connect the VT420 directly to a local host system with a cable.
You can also connect the terminal indirectly to a remote host system using
(1) a terminal server, or (2) a modem or acoustic coupler connected to
public-switched or dedicated telephone lines. See "Modems" in <A HREF="chapter8.html">Chapter 8</A>.</P>
<P><A HREF="#FC-1">Figure C-1</A> shows the DEC-423 and RS-232 cables you can use to connect
the VT420 to a host system or printer. To order cables, see <A HREF="appendixb.html">Appendix B</A>.</P>

<H2 ID="SC.2">XON/XOFF Flow Control</H2>
<P>Normally, the VT420 processes and displays characters as fast as it
receives them. If the host system send data faster than the terminal can
display it, the terminal can use XON/XOFF flow control to tell the host to
wait until the terminal has caught up.</P>
<P>The VT420 stores incoming characters in a 254-character input buffer.
When the buffer fills to a predetermined level (XOFF point), the terminal
sends an XOFF character to stop the host system from sending more
characters. When the buffer empties to an appropriate level (XON point),
the terminal sends an XON character to tell the host system to resume
sending character.</P>
<P>If the terminal is set up to run one session, you can select a first XOFF
point of 64 or 128 characters (Communications Set-Up screen). The XON
point is 32 characters. If the host system fails to respond to the first
XOFF character, the terminal sends another XOFF character when the
buffer fills to 220, and when the buffer is completely full.</P>
<P>If you use SSU software to run two sessions, you can select a first XOFF
point of 64, 256, or 1792. SSU provides its own credit-based flow control,
so XOFF is not needed.</P>
<P>For normal interactive use, you should use the default XOFF point of
64 characters. This setting prevents the host system from getting too
far ahead of what is displayed on the screen. In some cases, using an
XOFF point greater than 64 characters may improve the average speed
for processing characters, since the host does not have to wait as often.</P>

<H3 ID="SC.2.2">Notes on Using the VT420 Without XON/XOFF Flow Control</H3>
<UL>
<LI>If you disable XON/XOFF flow control, the terminal's receive input
buffer can overflow if the host system sends data faster than the
terminal can process and display it.</LI>
<LI><P>The VT420 can process text (without ESC sequences) at approximately
2000 characters/second. This rate allows the VT420 to communicate
at 19,200 baud. Some editing functions, such as inserting or deleting
characters in lines, require additional time to process. The 254-character
input buffer allows for short bursts.</P>
<P>For extensive editing, the host system should be programmed to insert
fill characters (NULs) after editing sequences. If the host system is
not programmed, you should reduce the terminal baud rate to 9600
baud or less. See the Communications Set-Up screen in <A HREF="chapter5.html">Chapter 5</A>.</P></LI>
<LI>Selecting one of the smooth scroll settings in the Display Set-Up
screen slows the screen display for easy reading. In order for the
smooth scroll setting to work properly at high speeds, you must have
XON/XOFF data flow enabled.</LI>
</UL>
<H2 ID="SC.3">Modem Connections and Disconnections</H2>
<P>When the VT420 makes a connection to the host system through a
modem, the terminal performs the following operations to ensure it is
ready to send and receive:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Unlocks the keyboard (if it was locked).</LI>
<LI>Clears any transmission in progress.</LI>
<LI>Clears the keyboard buffer and all message buffers.</LI>
<LI>Clears the input buffer.</LI>
<LI>Clears XOFF sent and XOFF received flags.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Any of the following conditions will disconnect the connection to the host
system:</P>
<UL>
<LI>You type <SPAN CLASS="keyname">Shift</SPAN> <SPAN CLASS="keyname">F5</SPAN> (Break).</LI>
<LI>You use the <TT>Recall</TT> or <TT>Default</TT> fields in the Set-Up Directory.</LI>
<LI>You change the host port you are using from the RS-232 port to the
DEC-423 port, or from the DEC-423 port to the RS-232 port. See the
<STRONG>comm port selection</STRONG> feature in the Communications Set-Up screen
(<A HREF="chapter5.html">Chapter 5</A>).</LI>
<LI>The terminal loses the data set ready (DSR) signal.</LI>
<LI>The terminal loses the receive line signal detect (RLSD) signal for
the period of time you selected in set-up. See the <STRONG>disconnect delay</STRONG>
feature in the Communications Set-Up screen.</LI>
<LI>The terminal receives a self-test command from the host system.</LI>
</UL>
<P>The usual way to disconnect communications is to type <SPAN CLASS="keyname">Shift</SPAN> <SPAN CLASS="keyname">F5</SPAN> (Break).</P>
<H2 ID="SC.4">Break Function</H2>
<P>A break condition is the occurrence of a continuous space on a
communication line for greater than one character time. Some systems
and communication equipment recognize break as a special attention
signal.</P>
<P>You can generate a break signal (275&nbsp;ms space) by pressing <SPAN CLASS="keyname">F5</SPAN> (Break),
unless you have changed the function of the <SPAN CLASS="keyname">F5</SPAN> key (Keyboard Set-Up
screen).</P>
<P>Changing the <STRONG>terminal comm ports</STRONG> feature setting from <TT>S1=Comm1</TT> to
one of the two-session configurations also generates a break signal. This
action alerts the host that the session configuration has been altered.</P>
<P>The <SPAN CLASS="keyname">F5</SPAN> (Break) key has three functions when used as a break key.</P>
