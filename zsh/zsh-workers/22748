:Hmm, thanks for trying this, Geoff, but I really want only the search

I meant the glimpse database index (which is the order in which results are
displayed).  The mhonarc HTML index pages should be the same.

:} etc. some files may appear out of order.
:Given that, I find it's unfortunately a bit too confusing to use in the
:browsing mode.  The way it was before was better.  My apologies.

I have (|pretended to have) been clever and have come up with a different
approach.  A quick test indicates it's OK.  See if it's working as expected.

Regards,
Geoff
