Typing away merrily, Sven Wischnowsky produced the immortal words:
[...]
> +         eval b\=\( \$\{b:/\*\(${(j:|:)fignore}\)\} \)
[...]
> +         eval c\=\( \$\{c:/\*\(${(j:|:)fignore}\)\} \)

One has to wonder about a shell where /that/ is valid input.

Whilst it's nice and understandable to people who're extensively
familiar, doesn't anyone else think it's time to sit back and try and
look at this syntax objectively?

(At least, almost understandable... oh yeah, understandable)
