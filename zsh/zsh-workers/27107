THANKS!  That's exactly what I was hoping for!  Coupled with repo.or.cz's
ability to create an http mirror of any git:// repository
(http://repo.or.cz/r/zsh/mirror.git), I now have enough to try out the recent
monitor patch.

Now, what would it take to get this documented in the FAQ and/or zsh homepage?
It might also be nice to document the sourceforge web-browseable interface,
http://zsh.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=zsh
