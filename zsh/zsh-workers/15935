Hi,

I've just upgraded from Zsh 4.0.2 to 4.1.0-dev-1, and I've noticed a change
in completion behaviour.

If I do:

% zsh -f
gdd-odybin2% autoload -U compinit
gdd-odybin2% compinit -C
gdd-odybin2% setopt cdablevars
gdd-odybin2% zstyle ':completion:*:complete:cd:*' tag-order local-directories
gdd-odybin2% cd c<TAB>

I get a list of local directories, users, and anything else cd can make use
of. If I do this on 4.0.2 then I only get local directories, assuming one
matches - otherwise I get the other stuff - which is what I want.

In 4.1.0 I get only the local directories if I do 'cd <TAB>', just like in
4.0.2. It's only when I've added the 'c' that it gives the full list.

Cheers,

Martin.
