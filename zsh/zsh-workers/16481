I really like the new fake parameter.

Though there is a possible strange behavior.  I'm not sure how multiple
matches are handled in other situations, so this might just be how
completion works.

Given these commands:

host@ zstyle :completion::complete:cvs-admin:option-k-1:option-k-1 fake
b:binary
host@ cvs admin -k<TAB>
---- keyword substitution
b  -- binary
b    k    kv   kvl  o    v

I wanted to add help text to options to the -k flag.  I was able to do that,
however, "b" is now listed twice. (As well as any other options to which I
add help.)


I'm happy with the new functionality.  Thanks Sven!  Since I'm already using
it,  I'd like to see that change committed.  :)

-FR.
