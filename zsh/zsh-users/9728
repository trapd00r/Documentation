 "_expand_word_and_keep of 'keeper suite' doesn't work" (Dec  1, 11:57am)

} The version of _expand_word_and_keep below (from the magazine

} the condition [[ $args[-J] == all-expansions ]] is never true

The accept-exact and keep-prefix styles can cause _expand to skip
the call to compadd entirely, and styles that affect the value of
$compstate[insert] can cause it to skip the step that passes the -J
flag.  What are your zstyle settings?
