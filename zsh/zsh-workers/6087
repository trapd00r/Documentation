OK, I will make sure to mention them.

Earlier OLDPWD didn't behave the same way (it seems to now though)

There's still a problem with my PROMPT:

PROMPT='
---------------------------------------- %t/%T  
----------------------------------------
%S[OLDPWD: $OLDPWD]
   [PWD: %~]%s
%B%n$LOCAL_HOST%b $REMOTE_HOST
'

it produces an extra blank line at the end (unlike 3.1.4)

It was my misunderstanding then.  From some offlist replies I got to earlier  
comments, it sounded like "Things change, get over it."  I realize now that  
I should have guessed they were not the voice of authority.

I don't remember any warnings... well, there were warnings, but I don't  
remember what they were.

I cannot solve it by giving unambiguous filenames:

# ls /
CDROM/              Users/              mach_kernel
LocalApps@          bin/                mach_kernel.OS42
LocalLibrary@       dev@                mach_kernel.nonY2K
Net/                drives/             private/
NextAdmin/          etc@                tmp@
NextApps/           lib/                usr/
NextDeveloper@      lost+found/
NextLibrary/        mach@

(note there is only one "/U")

# ls /U[tab]
# ls /U

# ls /drives/
IBM3/   win95/

# ls /drives/I[tab]
# ls /drives/I

NOTE: I can't build zsh again, I keep getting errors about files that end  
with .pro not existing (ie prompt.pro) and it dies.

I don't know how I did it before.
