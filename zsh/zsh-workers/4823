And this time it's for real:

  % typeset -A a
  % a[x*]=foo
  zsh: bad math expression: unbalanced stack
  % echo $a[x*]
  foo
  %

The problem is that isident() uses mathevalarg() to skip (!) over the
contents of a subscript (unless the subscript contains flags).

I don't have the time to fix this now since our LAN will soon be
upgraded but if noone else gives it a try I'll have a lokk at it.

Bye
 Sven
