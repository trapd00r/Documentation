There are a few other differences:
 - grep -R (at least the GNU variant as probably found on
 cygwin) will follow symbolic links when descending directories
 (use dir/***/* to achieve the same with zsh).
 - **/* will ommit dot files and do dirs, use **/*(D) to avoid
 that.
 - **/* also sorts the list of files which adds some more overhead but
 produces a more reproducible outcome. Use **/*(oN) to prevent
 sorting.


So

egrep -R something dir
would be more like:
egrep something dir/***/*(DoN)

grep -E something dir/**/*(.DoN)

would probably be more what you'd want though.
