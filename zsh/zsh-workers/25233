Peter's answer is nearly comprehensive, but I did want to point out
that "unlike bash" is incorrect here.

schaefer[503] bash
[schaefer@torch ~]$ for ((x=0; x<=10; x++)) do echo "$x"; done

[schaefer@torch ~]$ echo $x

The difference is not whether the *variable* "sticks around" but that the
implicit integer typedef sticks.
