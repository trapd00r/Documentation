Hey, I experienced just the same a few days back. So, I also think
this should be addressed. Maybe a new option could be introduced, that
works similar to the 'check_jobs' option that warns if jobs would be
killed. Similarly a 'hist_check_space' option could (if set) warn, if
a history file can not be written to disk.

In any case, I agree with Michael, that a history file should not be
truncated to zero-size if the needed space is not available. In that
case it's better, IMHO, to keep the old history file.

Regards, Frank
