This seems like a good guess... if you don't know what to do, try typing
"read<Return>" then hitting one of the sequences you want zsh to handle.
These should show up interpreted by the terminal (things like "^[[15~"
etc. etc.)  These are the strings zsh will get.  If you post these
together with the Unicode characters the sequences represent we might be
able to work out what's going on.

It may even be documented somewhere...
