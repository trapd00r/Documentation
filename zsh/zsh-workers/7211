Subject: Bug in printing of PS4 (the xtrace prompt)
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

I happened to have xtrace set while running compinit.  Here's the tail of
the output:

+compdump:89> print
+compdump:91> unfunction compdump
+\M-^H\M-9'^H0\M-4\n@^P:92> autoload -U compdump
+compinit:377> unfunction compinit
+(^^]^H0\M-4\n@^P:378> autoload -U compinit

Looks like it's using a garbaged string as the function name after the
function unfunctions itself.
