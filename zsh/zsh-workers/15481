I don't get this, even with the complete set of styles and options.  Are
you sure you've installed the new libraries?

The format looks extremely impressive.  The only point I'd make is the
utterly trivial one that using `--' to introduce the description is a bit
confusing when there are lots of --'s around introducing options.  How
about `#'?
