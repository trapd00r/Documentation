Just use rc_expand_param:

  print ${^array}\\r

Careful, however:  you still get the spaces between elements from
"print".  You can suppress those by joining the array elements first
using print escapes:

  print ${(pj:\r:)array}

(You did mean carriage return, didn't you?  You didn't simply want to
print one element of the array per line

  print -l $array

?)
