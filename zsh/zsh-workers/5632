What is the point of using NULL to initialize null pointer. The only
portable and official way is to use `0'(zero), that is garanteed to be
converted to whatever representation null pointer has on a given system.

I mention it, because I just recently have seen quite a number of bug
reports, that rsulted exactly from using something like NULL for this.

Just a reminder ...
