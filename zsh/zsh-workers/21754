I use this function for comparing the hexdump of two files,
hexdiff () {
=09diff -u <(hexdump "$1") <(hexdump "$2")
}

so in your case, what you want to do is comm -3 <(...) <(...)
or if you really want
foo1=3D$(...)
foo2=3D$(...)
comm -3 <(echo "$foo1") <(echo "$foo2")
but that seems stupid :)
Also note this syntax will provide pipes, if you use =3D(...) instead
you will get temp files like you asked for.
