I didn't get that for some reason (or deleted it without applying it).

I finally looked at it and it seems fine.  I don't understand why it wasn't

This is a good point, maybe Sven's idea can help with this.  It would be
nice to keep it as function-based as possible.  Simplifying the initial
implementation (where you could define variables as well as functions) was
a big step to making the whole thing more usable.
