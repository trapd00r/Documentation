OK, thanks for the explanations. So, the following script shows a bug
in zsh (typing Ctrl-C immediately interrupts the sleep and the script
and SIGINT is output):

#!/bin/sh

trap ''  INT
zsh -fc "emulate sh; trap 'echo SIGINT; exit' INT; sleep 6"

I wonder whether zsh should behave in the same way without
"emulate sh".
