} The question is: has Zle any standard tags too for configuring it?

No.  All zstyles are interpreted by shell functions, so only those
widgets that are implemented as shell functions are configurable in
this way.  The builtin widgets are only affected by setopts, if by
anything.

This is practically a FAQ.  No, there is no such plan; the operation of
zle does depend on zsh internals that cannot be externalized.
