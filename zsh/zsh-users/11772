The thing is you sometimes do want to rename files with mv. The
wrapper function could be made so as to check if there doesn't
exist a directory spelled like the last argument.

Something like:

mv() {
  local dest=$@[-1]
  if [[ ! -d $dest ]]; then
    local -a files
    setopt localoptions extendedglob
    files=((#a2)$dest(ND/))
    if (($#files)); then
      printf >&2 '"%s" doesn'\''t exist as a directory but\n' ${(V)dest}
      printf >&2 'there exist %d directory(ies) with a close name:\n' $#files
      local i
      for ((i = 1; i <= $#files; i++)); do
        printf >&2 ' %d "%s"\n' "$i" ${(V)files[i]}
      done
      printf >&2 'Would you like to move files to one of those instead (n12.)? [n] '
      local answer
      read answer
      if [[ $answer = [0-9]## ]]; then
        argv[-1]=$files[answer]
	set -x
      fi
    fi
  fi
  command mv "$@"
}
