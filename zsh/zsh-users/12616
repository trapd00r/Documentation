I use CVS for this; SVN or just about any revision control system
with networking support ought to do fine.  I check out everthing
into a ~/.zsh/ directory and run from there a little installer script
that pokes a ZDOTDIR setting into the ~/.zshenv, thus leaving intact
whatever the default skeleton was in case I need to revert.

I haven't tried doing an equivalent for bash.
