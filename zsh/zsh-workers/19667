Subject: Rather bad bug in 4.2.0 zle-line-init
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
X-Envelope-Sender:  <schaefer@closedmail.com>

Make any sort of mistake in zle-line-init, and the editor goes into an
infinite loop.

E.g. (be sure you can kill this shell from somewhere else):

zle-line-init() {
  setopt localoptions match
  echo not[a]pattern(that)matches{anything}
}
zle -N zle-line-init
