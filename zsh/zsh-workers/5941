With zsh-3.1.5-pws-13, zsh -f, files with spaces in don't seem to get
quoted properly.

So if I have the file "readme - corrections.txt", and I type:

        % less read<TAB>

I get 

        % less readme - 

I was expecting the spaces to be quoted with \.

I'm sure this worked once.  What's happened?
