Zsh was originally written to make csh users feel at home in a ksh-like
environment, so the interactive features that didn't affect scripting
often looked a lot like csh.

It might well have been different if it were done now, but actually I'm
quite happy with "%" since "\" is already rather overloaded in shells.
