Some prompt themes (e.g. elite) explicitly use characters with 8th bit set. This
looks really ugly here - tested on dtterm and console (AT386 terminal - dunno if
it specific to SINIX or is in common use) with ISO-8859-1 and ISO-8859-5
charsets.

What are these characters for? I believe, they are for semi-grafic with standard
IBM 437 codepage. Unfortunately, you cannot expect everybody to use it.

May be, 'prompt -p' or even 'prompt -l' should at least print warning if the
theme expects particular character set.

Or use style(s) to switch them on/off. Themes may look nicely even without these
characters - and users may conditionally switch them on/off depending on current
terminal.
