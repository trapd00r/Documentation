Subject: Uncommitted patches
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Any reasons I should not commit these?

16094: fix bug reported in 16082 (a related patch went into 4.0.[34])
16158: don't treat '\t' as 'y' in getquery()
16201: fix bug reported in users/3787 and again in users/4023 and yet
       again in users/4446

I didn't want to commit 16094 until it was tested by somebody else, but
maybe the only way to get it tested is to commit it.
