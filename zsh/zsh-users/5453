  Well, not to go too far off-topic, but I don't think the "collateral
damage" people really like it either...but when you have to upgrade your
SMTP infrastructure just to deal with spam, it starts to focus your
attention a little.
  This isn't a flame, even though it probably sounds like one, but I'll
tell you what _I_ dislike; people who continue to pay known
spam-friendly ISPs for Internet access and then imply that it's the
other end's problem when their mail is blocked.=20
