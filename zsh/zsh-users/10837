Hmmmm.... I don't see how this could help me. Actually, your
solution would EXIT the shell I came from, after the login
has finished!! So I not only have to type all the "exit"s on
the remote host, I would even loose my current shell on the
local host.

Maybe to repeat what I would like to do:

A typical application would go like this:

   rlogin foobar
   DO SOME STUFF
   cleartool setview myview # this creates a subshell
   DO MORE STUFF
   cleartool setview yourview # now I'm two subshells deep
   DO STILL MORE STUFF
   # Now I want to exit
   exit
   exit
   logout

I would like to have a (interactive) command which does the final two
exits plus
a logout for me.

BTW, I could imagine a solution using 'expect', which does the login,
then hands
over the control to the user, and finally if the user is done, performs
the
exit and logout.
