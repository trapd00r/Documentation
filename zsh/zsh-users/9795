My bet is on a huge or corrupt history file.  If that's not the
problem, try trussing the shell as it exits.  Run "echo $$" in one
window/vty to get the pid, then in another run "truss -d -f -o log.txt
-p <pid>".  Then go back to the first screen and exit the shell.  When
it's done, look at the logfile to see what's happenning when.
