Subject: Adding array content to cd completion

I have an array of directories I frequently visit.
I would like the completion of "cd" to include
those directories, as a separate group.

I put the following in my .zshrc. It works but is
ugly and crude. There must be a better way to do
it.

---------------%<----------------
mycompletion() {
   _cd
   compadd -X Jumps -a jumplist
}
compdef mycompletion cd
---------------%<----------------

Suggestions?
