Subject: Re:  Manual for new style completion


I forgot to mention... 

The patch does not change the compctl.yo file and thus doesn't
document the `compctl -K " foo"' syntax to invoke completion widgets
from compctl's. Do we want to keep this mechanism? We would have to
find a better syntax for it then, I think.

Bye
 Sven
