We could use zsh/net/*.  I wouldn't want to move zftp there, however, since
it will be a major nuisance now.  But there's nothing to stop us making
zsh/net/tcp.  Zftp is directly useful to users, while tcp isn't, so hiding
the one at a lower level makes some kind of twisted sense.

I don't know offhand if the install scripts handle extra levels, but
zmodload won't have any problem.
