    If you can use "expr", you can do it with "expr", using simple
regexes. OK, not the fastest method, but should do and should do it
pretty fast. I use this approach in my "mobs" project. Being bulletproof
using almost-portable shell scripting is, at least, tricky. And probably
impossible, for what I've seen...
