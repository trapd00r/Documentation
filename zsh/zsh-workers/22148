I didn't code that up yet, but I did commit an improved version of
mb_niceformat() that avoids truncating a name at the first erroneous
character (taking into account your other feedback on my prior patch).

Cool -- I was hoping that would be the case.  I got rid of all the code
that used wcswidth().

I see that I misread what the returned width was measuring.  Thanks!
