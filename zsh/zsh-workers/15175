It's all as it should be, including this one:

because it depends on the completion strings.  If the listing code finds
out that packing the list doesn't decrease the number of lines needed,
it uses equally sized columns in the hope that they are better readable.

Try it with:

  % setopt listtypes listpacked
  % touch a12345678901234567890{a,b,c,d} b12{a,b,c,d}
  % ls <TAB>

and you'll see that the listing code can sometimes even increase the
number of spaces between columns if it can do so without needing more
lines (it currently does that only if it can give the same number of
spaces to each column).


And a `btw': with coloured completion listings setting list_types isn't
really needed anymore, so the original poster may think about unsetting it.


Bye
  Sven
