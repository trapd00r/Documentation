Hi Peter,

Indeed i said that this bug hitted tab completion, but it only happens
with menu selection, i had it activated by default and forgotted to mention
it in my previous email. After checking it, tab completion is ok, but menu
selection 'transforms' the file name.

And yes, your patch fix the problem ;)

thanks,
