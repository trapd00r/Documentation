Right, but a command processors has to know to do that dance. It's in
Functions/Misc/zcalc, and in sticky-note which were suggested as
examples of command processors.

The problem is that an error message which prevents functioning of a
command should only be given when there *is* an error, not in
anticipation of a situation which sometimes is an error. ;-) If there
is history in the history list, then fc -l should show it, and if
there is no history it could either report no history and/or suggest
that not being in an interactive mode might be one (but not the only)
reason why.

Could this be changed please?

Ok. I think this needs to be done one step at a time. If one can issue
instructions to turn on various pieces that were disabled by virtue of
being non-interactive (like setting/reading history files),  then
changing all of this in one shot isn't all that important.
