Hi!

Is it possible to switch zsh output to file *and* terminal (the way tee
does) and then back? I have tried

exec > /dec/fd/1 > /some/output/file
date
exec > /dev/fd/1
date

After first exec output is really redirected to both terminal and file.
But I have found that it is not possible any more to close file!!! that
is, second exec does nothing - output is still directed to both.

Yes, I know at least two means to do the same; but I really would prefer
the above method, because otherweise
  I have to use { ...... } > .. > .. construct. It potentially means
  many levels of { } bracketing, which I would like to avoid.

thanks in advance

greetings
