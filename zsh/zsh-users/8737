    Don't know why :? Here your function applied to a binary file
31MB in size results in 26 seconds in zsh, 14 in bash, so it's true,
the difference is noticeable. Unfortunately not both shells consider
a 'line' the same in a binary file (more in this subject below), and
bash may be reading longer lines and doing much less I/O :???

    Not reproduceable here. I always have the same, consistent
result.

    The problem with binary files is: what's a line? Some arbitrary
stream of characters until a '\n' is found? Some arbitary stream of
characters that ends in a '\0'? Your measurement is incorrect because
you don't make sure what's in $IFS, and 'read' uses $IFS. You cannot
do such things on binary files from a shell script.

    Just out of curiosity: why are you messing with lines in a binary
file? Maybe you can do what you want in a faster and more portable
way. If you tell us, maybe we can help :)
