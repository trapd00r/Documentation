hello

I have switched to zsh with the installation of a freebsd workstation @ h=
ome;=20
among others, I have the following problem:

on my linux machine (bash-2.5) I have added one entry in /etc/hosts stati=
ng=20
192.168.0.1 host1 - which helped me when ssh-ing (just typing ssh root@h[=
TAB]=20
and I got the host1 completed)

here, using zsh, I tried to do the same, but I get something like:

[petre@kgb]$ more /etc/hosts | grep cockeru                              =
    =20
192.168.108.176          cockeru
[petre@kgb]$ ssh root@coc                                                =
    =20
No matches for: `remote host name', `host', or `corrections'

I'm using

[petre@kgb]$ zsh --version                                               =
    =20
zsh 4.0.6 (i386-portbld-freebsd4.7)


where and what should I modify ?

thanks,

petre
