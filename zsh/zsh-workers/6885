Subject: zsh restricted mode... need cd back
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

I want to run zsh in restricted mode but still have cd ability (at least
in thier home directories and no lower)
but I have 2 problems... 1. I can not seem to be able to run it in
restricted mode and I ahve read all the documentation I can before
asking you guys.. and 2. I can not find where it restricts the cd
ability in the source code so I can bring it back
