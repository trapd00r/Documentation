Yes, this (plus the several followups) is quite good.  The only thing
more I could wish for is that TAB would move down the columns in menu
selection, rather than across, so that you don't get equivalent options
offered consecutively.  But that's such a minor thing that it's likely
not worth expending effort.

} If you try it, you'll see that this now behaves slightly different when
} completion options with and without groups in menu selection.  In the
} first case, only the matches are highlighted, in the latter case the
} whole lines are highlighted.

Having seen it both ways (thanks to that typo in _describe) I think this
is just fine.

My only other suggestion at this point would be to change the default
separator from `--' to one of `-', `=', or `:', but as it's configurable
that is again an exceptionally minor issue.
