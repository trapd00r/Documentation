Subject: odd completion behavior

pws-4:

zsh 5 % a2ps --pretty-print=  
_main_complete: bad pattern: (\M-T^Q^HPs^T@^P [92]
zsh 5 % a2ps --pretty-print=
_main_complete: bad pattern: (\n1^HPs^T@^P [92]
zsh 5 % a2ps --pretty-print=
_main_complete: bad set of key/value pairs for associative array [92]
zsh 5 % 

These were achieved by typing a2ps --pre<TAB to complete until the =>
then between 3 to 40 TABs until the error occurred.

Anyone know what's going on here?
