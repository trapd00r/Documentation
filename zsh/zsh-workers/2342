Please no. looking for xxx/yyy in the current directory just because it
contains a / is horrible. The normal method for zsh to search for ordinary
programs is to look in the PATH for xxx/yyy stuff, why not for modules
as well? Makes it more consistent. This was added by PF after I requested
it as it is perfect for managing the PATH namespace. It would be nice
to have this for modules as well.
