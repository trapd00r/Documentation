The following might be a more palatable fix, as it produces a parse error
rather than silently treating the '|' as a ';'.  This is still not the
same as bash (which says "unexpected end of file") but arguably "syntax
error near `|'" is a more helpful error anyway.

There are still other cases where zsh doesn't crash, but doesn't produce
an error either.  E.g. (even without the following patch):

schaefer[643] bash -c 'echo |{;}'
bash: syntax error near unexpected token `;}'
bash: -c: line 1: `echo |{;}'
schaefer[644] Src/zsh -fc 'echo |{;}'
schaefer[645] 

(Perhaps the patch should set tok = LEXERR only when tok == ENDINPUT ?
I couldn't decide.)
