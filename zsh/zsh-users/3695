I was way beyond compinstall -- making custom completers for my own
commands, etc.  Then I stepped back and analyzed the effort I was
expending for the actual benefit.  Using compctl exclusively removes
the temptation for spending time customizing every command I ever run.

Thinking back, startup time was not the problem that caused me to
switch back.  It was the fact that simple tab file completion got
slower.  Occasionally I'm doing stuff on slower systems with NFS file
systems.  Completing files with TAB was noticeably slower with the new
system over the old.
