I've got it today. My zsh exited again (without my will). This is the
output:

-->start here<--
Last login: Tue Mar 10 20:43:01 1998 from pop3.kappa.ro
Linux 2.0.33.
You have new mail.

dmircea@mail:/home/dmircea% mutt
/etc/zlogout: command not found: utt
Logout
Connection to secu closed.
--> end here <--

As I said before that is a Linux 2.0.33 machine with zsh-3.0.5. 
/etc/zlogout:

--> start here <--
echo Logout
--> end here <--

Hints?
