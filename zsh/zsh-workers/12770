Recompiling Functions
---------------------

If you frequently edit your zsh functions, or periodically update your
zsh installation to track the latest developments, you may find that
function digests compiled with the zcompile builtin are frequently out
of date with respect to the function source files.  This is not usually
a problem, because zsh always looks for the newest file when loading a
function, but it may cause slower shell startup and function loading.
====

I remember, that Sven explicitly stated that digest files are *not* checked
against there source functions to save execution time (individual files are).
I do not have articele number handy.
