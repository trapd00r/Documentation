From: Peter Stephenson <pws@csr.com>

I'm about to commit my function system which runs on top of the ztcp
builtin.  This is a large and (apart from hooking the documentation
together) largely self-contained package, so I haven't bothered posting
it.

You will need to `config.status --recheck' to get config.modules to
notice the new functions to be installed, unless you feel like hacking
it.  The functions live in Functions/TCP.  (If you don't want to install
it you can edit it out of the zsh/net/tcp line in config.modules and
change `auto' to `no'.)

Documentation is in the zshtcpsys manual page.  It's been written over
the last few days so may still be a bit rough.
