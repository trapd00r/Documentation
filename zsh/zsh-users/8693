yes it does. It is called history-incremental-search-backward in zsh and is=
=20
bound to ^R by default in emacs key bindings:

{pts/1}% bindkey -L | grep back
=2E..
bindkey "^R" history-incremental-search-backward

(it is possible that bash and zsh inplementations are slightly different, I=
 do=20
not use bash on regular basis).
