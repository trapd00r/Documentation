} You're right that 3.1.5 and 3.1.6 don't look much alike. [...] How
} about something like 3.1.99? or even 3.99? or something?

} The vital point is, that 3.1.6 is just a bug fix in this scheme ...
} and more than a year for a bug fix is certainly too much :-)

Personally, I think calling it 3.1.6 will be just fine; there's never
been any statement that the `z' numbers were "bug fixes," only that
the even `y' indicated a stable release and the odd `y' a development
release.

And there was almost a year between 3.1.2 and 3.1.3, with several
zefram-N releases in between, so it's not like we haven't done this
before.
