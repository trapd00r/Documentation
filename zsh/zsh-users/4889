Ack!  As usual I never provide enough info.. :)  4.0.4.

compinit, yes.  I found a set of zsh startup scripts somewhere, can't recall 
where now, but they set up quite a bit of stuff.  I should have done this 
first, but I've put the scripts I'm using on http://theblackmoor.net/zsh

I've made a few changes since I posted the message (been doing some reading 
:) had have answered a few of my own questions, but will likely make more 
changes based on your help :)

Bookmarked, reading after this message :)

DOH!  Works great, a fine example of my not rtfm'ing.

Interestingly, just setopt doesn't show this, but when I did unsetopt 
rec_exact it responded as infered.

Aha, yes, it was set in the zshrc I started with, it's now removed.  And now 
it works perfectly!  I'm going to have to look at all the opts this file is 
setting up and see exactly what they're doing..  Didn't consider that.

Aha, I had been trying to poke around and do just this, had just been 
thinking about it, hadn't looked into screen yet.

This I shall, I noticed the delay was about half with no .zshrc (and thus no 
aliases, prompt script, etc..), I'll check out compiling the scripts.

Very, thank you :)  I've also been skimming the list and have found a 
plethora of neat stuff, I'm taking notes and/or adding it to my zshrc, etc, 
because I never remember anything.  :)

Cheers.
