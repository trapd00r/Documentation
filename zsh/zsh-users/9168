    OK, that makes perfect sense.

    That looks logical, too, because zsh is not smart enough (yet) to
know that the source and destination is the same array.

    The correct sentence for "you're welcome" is "de nada", BTW, but
thanks for answering in spanish :) And since I'm always getting into
problems I cannot solve by myself, I'm sure that I'll find my way
into many 'interesting' (read: buggering) problems ;) Thanks a lot,
really.
