Hi Eric,

Is zsh really that old? For some reason, 1991 was the date I had
in mind for the first public release.

But I can see some code copyrighted 1990. The changelog in the
current sources go only as far back as 2.6-beta1 (1994), I think
I must have started using it around 97 so probably a 3.x
already.

Is there any place where we can download the old releases? I
have got a 2.00.03 on my hard disk for some reason, but there's
no changelog in there I can see.

Cheers,
Stéphane
