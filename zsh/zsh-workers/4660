I've been using zsh on a DEC Alpha for quite some time now without any 
problems (after some fixes in previous zsh versions that have already
made it into the baseline). Alphas use the LP64 convention which seems 
to become standard for 64Bit systems (longs and pointers are 64 bit,
ints are 32 bit).

This reminds me... One note for Zefram: when trying to compile a zsh
with dynamic loading on this Digital Unix 4.0d I had to use gcc as the 
linker. Without it the binary couldn't be linked. With it I got heaps
of warnings about unresolved symbols but the binary worked fine. The
warnings could have been avoided by using `-Xlinker -z -Xlinker defs', 
I think.

Bye
 Sven
