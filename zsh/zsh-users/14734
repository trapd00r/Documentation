Yes, I was refering what Greg said. As in the part I quoted.

I don't know of a way to make zsh tell which files it would source in
certain modes. There is documentation, however, that will tell you which
files will be used in which mode if they exist. The zshwiki has a page,
that summarises all that: <http://zshwiki.org/home/config/files>

Regards, Frank.
