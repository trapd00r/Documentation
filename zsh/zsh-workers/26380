} So presumably zle.so got rebuilt but compsomething.so didn't?  However,
} I don't see any interface changes that might explain it.

I believe recompiled were complist.o, zle_hist.o, zle_keymap.o, and as
a conseqence zle.so, but that make output is now a few lines out of my
scrollback buffer. :-(

Perhaps what happened is that "cvs up" set the date stamp on iwidgets.list
to something older than the last build time of the other .o files.  If I
"touch Src/Zle/iwidgets.list" and then "make", a whole lot of things get
compiled that I'm quite sure were not compiled immediately after the
update.
