myfax() {
  local last=${argv[(i)[^-()0-9]*]}
 
  command myfax "${(j..)argv[1,last-1]//[-()]}" "$argv[last,-1]"   
}

That uses the (i) subscript flag to find the first arg commencing with
a different character. I'd be inclined to check all characters:
  (^[-()0-9]#)
You could use a loop to do the same.
