    Hi all :)

    Sorry for self replying... again.

    I've tried to be a bit less stupid and use the correct form:

    print ${line##\#(<=|=>| |)}

    Obviously that zsh will use the shortest-first match if
instructed to do so. Sorry for the noise, I didn't noticed I was
using "#" instead of "##".
