Hi,

I'm an intermediate zsh user, and can't do the whacko stuff yet. 
But haven't learnt any tricks recently, last one was

> vim =some_script (from anywhere)

where the = means search paths for script location.

So please a link to a handy website, or your tips/tricks.

On the above BTW is it possible to do a

> cd =some_script   (doesn't work)

to jump to the directory??
