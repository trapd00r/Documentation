Agreed!  :-)

I just tried the example in the book _From Bash to Z Shell_, which I
highly recommend and think those involved did a great job, and it just
worked.  Okay, so I used a different key binding from that in the book
but that was to prevent it clashing with other bindings I have.  The
book suggests:

 autoload -U edit-command-line
 zle -N edit-command-line
 bindkey '\ee' edit-command-line

to make ESC-e bring up the editor.  I used ^E.

What are you trying?


Cheers,
       Nick.
