:autoconf if you want to try this out.  I've tried it on IRIX and

Beautiful - testing awk on the systems which have the most bugs.  Well, if
it works on those, it should work on anything :-)
Actually, if people have old SunOS awk and nawk, or old HPUX awk and can test
with those it should be fine (there's another system which had quite a lot
of problems but I've forgotten which - I haven't done much portable awk
stuff for a while)
