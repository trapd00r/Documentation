Peter et al -

As you wrote, this is going back some ways (it's been *at least* 3
years since I built on a SunOS 4 platform) - I had to
--disable-dynamic in order to build a working zsh on SunOS4.  I recall
investigating further, but I never got the build to the point where
building with dynamic linking worked, IIRC.
