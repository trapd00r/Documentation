This patch doesn't work on OpenBSD (-current @i386).

umount [TAB] gives me:

[pea@coredump:~]% umount _canonical_paths_add_paths:zstat:1:
usr/src/sys: no such file or directory
_canonical_paths_add_paths:zstat:1: usr/src/sys: no such file or
directory=20
	umount
             /            /dev/sd0a    /dev/svnd0a  /home/pea
