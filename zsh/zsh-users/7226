You might also want to try ksh-mode in Xemacs which has pretty nice
syntax highlighting and it auto-indents nicely.  Although I did
customize my indention a bit in ~/.emacs.  That is what I have used
for shell programming for years.  I do not like the default indention
behavior of shell-script-mode.  It indents everything even though it
is not inside a function or control block and it does not seem to
re-indent when you hit the <tab> key.  It just indents further.
