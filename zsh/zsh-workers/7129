It only calls itself recursively when it has just successfully found a
symbolic link, which is what the return status is really about --- it's
used to know whether to print " -> <resolved-link>" in print_if_link().
The code construction is a little odd at that point, however, since (flag
== 0) apparently has the same effect as not having CHASELINKS set, but
instead will try to read the link and then ignore the result.  I didn't see
an obvious bug but I didn't try very hard.
