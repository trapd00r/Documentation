Run

	zsh -fc 'print done'

If you see anything other than "done", that's the problem.

If you don't see anything but "done", then nvi likely is running the shell 
without the -f switch, which I guess might be reasonable because -f does 
not mean the same thing in bash/ksh as in csh/zsh.  In which case you 
should try

	zsh -c 'print done'

and again anything you see other than "done" is the problem.
