What you're missing is that the documentation nearly always is expressed
in terms of character positions, not semantic buffer contents.  Thus
the suffix -word in a command name means the prefix (delete, forward,
upcase, etc.) is applied across the range of characters from the cursor
position to the next character that represents a word boundary; not to
the semantic entity that you think of as "a word".
