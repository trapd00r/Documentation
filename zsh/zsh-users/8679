Paramter expansion happens before brace expansion in normal evaluation
order, so it'd be sufficient if the tilde flag made braces eligible for
interpretation as it does with glob metacharacters.  The reason it does
not is mostly historical, but also for compatibility bash.  (I notice
that tcsh expands braces that result from parameter expansion.)

} Perhaps the "e" flag should also do brace expansion [...] there is
} probably a good reason it doesn't.

The operations enabled by (e) all have the same evaluation order as
parameter expansion (that is, they're done left to right as the parser
encounters them).

} It can be done without cat:
} { while read line ; eval print $line } < file

Or even

  while read line; do eval print $line; done < file

(which doesn't require the SHORT_LOOPS setopt).
