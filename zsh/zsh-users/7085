This sounds OK... I presume you're going to add some hook to the main Twisted
program (or some configuration utility) that reports the installation location
so that the functions distribution with zsh can find the functions
distributed with Twisted.

As far as I know, nobody's done that yet, but it seems a sensible way of
doing it.
