Hi,

Zefram: The indication that the completion is incomplete is that a space is
Zefram: not inserted.

yes you are right - if I was awake enough I'd realise that there was no
trailing space (or slash for a directory). Still, I'd like a beep and a
completion list (if I ordered one) without having to hit <TAB> the second
time. Maybe we can have another setopt option 'BEEP_THE_FIRST_TIME'
(other suggestions are very welcome).

				Anthony.
