Why do we even need the zstat if we're doing $(cd ...; pwd) ?  I used
zstat in the first place to avoid having to cd to a directory that might
not be readable/executable (though I suppose "umount" would normally be
used by root) but if you're going to cd anyway then you can skip the
whole "while" loop on zstat and just "pwd -P" once.

Or better, try the "pwd -P" first and fall back on the while loop.

(Or did your most recent patch do that?  I've lost track.)

I'm beginning to think this whole exercise is a bad idea anyway.  I have
visions of sysadmins attempting to umount a misbehaving NFS server or a
failing disk and ending up with their session frozen as zsh attempts to
access the bad filesystem behind the scenes.
