Come to think of it, it's not clear that looking at I/O from the shell
is going to tell you much: opens and ioctls might, but the command
that's not showing output,

   ls | sed 's/\<\(.\)\([^ ]*\)/\u\1\L\2/g'

doesn't have output going through the shell.  The shell forks, set's up
the pipe, and forks again; one of the forked shells execs ls, the other
sed.  The output goes straight from ls to sed to the terminal.
