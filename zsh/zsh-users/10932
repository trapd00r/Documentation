Hello!

I am using zsh 4.3.2 from the debian backports and figured out some
strange behaviour when starting a zsh inside another zsh.

Line from .zshrc:

export PATH=$PATH:/home/user/path

Of course, at the first start all works fine. But when I start another
zsh and /home/user/path is listed twice in $PATH, my shell is acting
weird.

For example, pressing "Cursor up" calls the last history entry but
points the cursor at the first character (expected: after the last).
Pressing "<END>" then results in changing the first word to capital
letters.

What is going on here? And how do I fix it?

Regards
 Stephan
