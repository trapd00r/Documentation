I've done a few tests and don't get history corruption.

But my patch avoided a possible problem in rename() when there is a
tmpfile. With your patch, one still has:

        if (fclose(out) < 0 && ret >= 0)
            ret = -1;
        if (ret >= 0) {
            if (tmpfile) {
                if (rename(tmpfile, unmeta(fn)) < 0)
                    zerr("can't rename %s.new to $HISTFILE", fn);
                free(tmpfile);
                tmpfile = NULL;
            }

Note that since out has been closed, tmpfile is no longer locked.
The target file isn't locked either.

Now, I don't think that rename() can be cached. So, I'd say that there
should be no problems under "normal" conditions.
