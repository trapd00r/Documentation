Hm.  What you describe isn't quite the same thing, but I think I've
finally got the original complaint figured out, based on what you say.

In order for the effect to happen, you must have all of autoremoveslash,
alwaystoend, and completeinword set.  Starting with this:

zsh% /usr/

Move the cursor to the 's'.  Press TAB.

3.0.5	-->	/usr/
3.1.4	-->	/usr//

In both cases, the cursor is at the end of the string.  Any following
key other than one bound to self-insert will delete the slash that is
immediately before the cursor.  In 3.1.4, this still leaves the original
slash behind, but it was wrong to have inserted a second slash in the
first place.  In 3.0.5, this (incorrectly?) deletes the only slash.

This also works starting with (say) /u/ or /us/, with the cursor on the
second slash or the 's'.

} This is actually a more general problem, because it doesn't have to be a
} slash character which gets deleted.  It'll be whatever would be deleted
} with a backspace.

I can't come up with any case that deletes anything other than slashes or
spaces.  Here's how to get it to delete a space:

zsh% touch /tmp/foo
zsh% ls /tm/foo

Move the cursor to the 'm' and press TAB.  In both 3.0.5 and 3.1.4, this
produces "ls /tmp/foo " (note the trailing space).  In 3.1.4, typing any
further key other than self-insert deletes the trailing space.  3.0.5
leaves the space alone.
