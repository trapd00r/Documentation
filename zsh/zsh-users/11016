} parsing yourself or running _arguments twice.  You can edit words (the
} command line) and CURRENT (the index into it), plus it's also possible
} in some contexts to tell _arguments to limit the words visible in the
} completion that it's calling by the use of enough colons.  I find
} directly manipulating words and CURRENT less infuriating.

Don't forget about compset:

    -n BEGIN [ END ]
          If the current word position as specified by the parameter
          CURRENT is greater than or equal to BEGIN, anything up to the
          BEGIN'th word is removed from the words array and the value
          of the parameter CURRENT is decremented by BEGIN.

          If the optional END is given, the modification is done only if
          the current word position is also less than or equal to END.
          In this case, the words from position END onwards are also
          removed from the words array.

          Both BEGIN and END may be negative to count backwards from
          the last element of the words array.

    -N BEG-PAT [ END-PAT ]
          If one of the elements of the words array before the one at
          the index given by the value of the parameter CURRENT matches
          the pattern BEG-PAT, all elements up to and including the
          matching one are removed from the words array and the value
          of CURRENT is changed to point to the same word in the
          changed array.

          If the optional pattern END-PAT is also given, and there is an
          element in the words array matching this pattern, the
          parameters are modified only if the index of this word is
          higher than the one given by the CURRENT parameter (so that
          the matching word has to be after the cursor). In this case,
          the words starting with the one matching end-pat are also
          removed from the words array. If words contains no word
          matching END-PAT, the testing and modification is performed
          as if it were not given.

So it should work to do something like

	compset -N '[^-]*'

before calling _arguments.
