The point is not how many characters I type (but wiht Zsh I tend to use
less :-) The point is: I expect zsh to complete /c/d/t to a valid path
(all possibly valid paths) that match this string. And /cygdrive/d/temp
is valid path in my case. It is the same, as if Zsh simply always
skipped one directory.

Small explanation to Sven:

To access other drives under Cygwin I need either to

- mount each drive explicitly somewhere under root
or
- simply use /cygdrive that gives you "single filesystem tree" image

For this reason I really wish Zsh could assist here.
