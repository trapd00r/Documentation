                             5 Composing Characters

   The VT320 lets you use more characters than appear on your keyboard, by
   typing compose sequence. A compose sequence is a series of two or three
   keystrokes that produces a single compose character. You can use
   three-stroke sequences on all VT320 keyboards. You can use two-stroke
   sequences on all keyboards except the North American/United Kingdom and
   Norwegian/Danish keyboards.

   Two basic factors determine which compose sequences you can use.
     * your VT320 keyboard model
     * the character set the terminal is currently using

What Characters Can I Use?

   You can only select characters from the character set the terminal is
   currently using. You can select from 2 multinational sets (DEC
   Multinational and ISO Latin-1) or 12 national replacement character
   sets (NRCs). By default, the VT320 uses the DEC Multinational set. See
   "Character Sets" in Chapter 2.

   The Character Set Mode feature in the General Set-Up screen sets the
   terminal to work with 8-bit multinational sets or 7-bit NRC sets.

  If You Use a Multinational Character Set

   Table 5-1 lists the compose characters you can use. Some characters are
   only available in one of the multinational character sets, DEC
   Multinational or ISO Latin-1. You select these sets with the
   User-Preferred Character Set feature in the General Set-Up screen.

  If You Use a 7-Bit NRC Set

   You select one of the NRC sets by using the _____ Keyboard feature in
   the Set-Up Directory. The compose characters available also depend on
   whether you use typewriter or data processing keys. You select
   typewriter or data processing keys with the _____ Keys feature in the
   Keyboard Set-Up screen.

   NOTE: When you select "Data Processing Keys", keys that have three or
   more characters on their keycap send the characters on the right half
   of the keycap.
     * Use Table 5-2 with the "Typewriter Keys" setting. This table lists
       compose characters by keyboard.
     * Use Table 5-3 with the "Data Processing Keys" setting.

   Table 5-2 shows how to compose characters that do not appear on the
   given keyboard. If you want to compose a character that is not already
   on the keyboard, refer to Table 5-1 for the character and the correct
   sequence.

   When you use a 7-bit NRC set, some accent marks that appear on some
   European keyboards are not available. These accent marks are 8-bit
   characters.

Three-Stroke Sequences

   You can use three-stroke sequences on any VT320 keyboard. All
   three-stroke sequences start with the Compose Character key. Tables 5-1
   and 5-2 list the three-stroke sequences.

   NOTE: If the Compose Character key does not work, check the Compose
   feature in the Keyboard Set-Up screen (Chapter 4).

   If you use a diacritical mark in a three-stroke sequence, the VT320
   uses an equivalent character. The North American/United Kingdom and
   Dutch keyboards do not have diacritical marks.

      Diacritical Mark     Equivalent Character
   Diaresis (umlaut) mark Double quote "
   Acute accent           Apostrophe '
   Grave accent           Single quote `
   Circumflex accent      Circumflex character ^
   Tilde mark             Tilde character ~
   Ring mark              Asterisk * or degree °

  Using a Three-Stroke Sequence

   You can select a three-stroke compose character as follows.
    1. Find the character you want in column 1 of Table 5-1 or 5-2.
    2. Press the Compose Character key. The Compose indicator turns on,
       indicating the terminal is in compose mode.
    3. Type the two characters in column 2 for the character you want.

   For example, to select an e with an acute accent, press Compose
   Character, then type e and ' (apostrophe).

Two-Stroke Sequences

   Two-stroke sequences are faster than three-stroke sequences, because
   you do not use the Compose Character key. However, two-stroke sequences
   are limited to sequences starting with the following nonspacing
   diacritical marks.
     * grave accent `
     * acute accent ´
     * circumflex accent ^
     * tilde mark ~
     * diaeresis mark (umlaut) ¨
     * ring mark °

   NOTE: You cannot use two-stroke sequences on the North American/United
   Kingdom or Dutch keyboards.

   Some European keyboards have keys with both a standard character and a
   diacritical mark. Make sure you select the correct character when you
   use these keys in compose sequences.

  Using a Two-Stroke Sequence

   You can select a two-stroke compose character as follows.
    1. Find the character you want in column 1 of Table 5-1, 5-2, or 5-3.
       Check column 3 to make sure you can use a two-stroke sequence for
       that character.
    2. Press the key with the diacritical mark shown in column 3. The
       Compose indicator comes on, indicating the terminal is in compose
       mode.
    3. Type the second character shown in column 3.

   For example, to select an e with a grave accent on a Danish keyboard,
   you would type ` (grave accent) then e.

Invalid Sequences

   When you complete a valid compose sequence, the compose character
   appears on the screen and the Compose indicator turns off. If you use
   an invalid sequence, the VT320 cancels the sequence and sounds the
   warning bell. (You can turn the warning bell on or off in the Keyboard
   Set-Up screen, Chapter 4).

   NOTE: Pressing a function key cancels a compose sequence without
   sounding the bell.

Canceling or Restarting a Compose Sequence

   If you accidentally start a compose sequence by pressing the Compose
   Character key or a diacritical mark key, press the <x] key. This
   immediately cancels the compose sequence.

   If you press Compose Character during a compose sequence, a new
   three-stroke sequence starts from that point. The first sequence is
   canceled.

   If you press any of the following keys during a compose sequence, they
   cancel the sequence and perform their usual function.
     * Tab
     * Return
     * Enter
     * Any top-row key
     * Period (.) key on the numeric keypad
     * Any Ctrl-other key combination
