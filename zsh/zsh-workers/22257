This looks extremelly promising (particularly since it still passes all
the tests as modified) but there is one glitch which turned up from the
function is-at-least, which is called liberally from my .zshrc.
It traces down to:

fn() {
  local IFS=.-
  print -l ${=1:-1.2}
}

With no arguments, this used to give

1
2

but now gives

1.2

With 1.2 passed as an argument instead it always gives the first
behaviour.  I suspect this is the wrong behaviour since bash gives me:

$ fn() { local IFS=.-; echo ${1:-1.2}; }
$ fn
1 2

which suggests the argument should be split (as it's unquoted).
(Naively, I would also expect an unquoted 1.2 to be split in the same way
whether it came from the positional parameter or the default.)

Anyway, I expect that's yet another complexity.
