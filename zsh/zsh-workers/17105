This isn't quite right; normal function execution doesn't work quite
that way.  What is happening is I have a function that sets a trap,
which gets restored because of the localtraps option.  Freeing a trap
does use freeeprog, with the described behaviour.  So it's less
disastrous, and I can probably avoid using local traps, but would still
be nice to fix.
