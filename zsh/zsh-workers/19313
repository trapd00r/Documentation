This isn't something we'd fix on 4.0.8, anyway, which is now being
declared dead.  (At least, if 4.0.8 compiles; I'm on holiday after
tomorrow, so it would be a good idea to tell me before.)

It's certainly a possibility for 4.1.  It will required testing for
grantpt, unlockpt and ptsname, which seem to be present but undocumented
(anywhere that I can see), thought chances are they're basically
POSIX-compatible.  So ideally it should be done by someone who knows
what they're doing.
