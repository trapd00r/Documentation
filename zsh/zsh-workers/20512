It seems like zsh on 10-8 works like I'm use to, but a change since
then has changed the behavior.    Not sure if Peter intended this.

Comparing an empty or unset string against an empty pattern returns
false.  Here's the code:
zsh -f
% a=""
% b="abc"
% [[ "$a" == "" ]] ; echo $status
1
% [[ "$b" == "abc" ]] ; echo $status
0
% [[ "$c" == "" ]] ; echo $status
1
