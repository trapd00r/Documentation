Subject: PATCH: langinfo module thinks October is January
Date: Fri, 30 May 2003 12:16:02 +0200
Message-ID: <3021.1054289762@gmcs3.local>

I tried to use $langinfo to get the month names instead of typing them
out but it was printing January for October to December.

${(v)langinfo[(I)MON*]} correctly lists the months but try
$langinfo[MON_10] and you get January. The problem is caused by it
using strncmp to find the keys in the table and comparing the first
five characters of MON_1 with MON_10 matches. So $langinfo[MON_5wibble]
will also return May. With this patch, it just uses strcmp instead.

The termcap module seems to suffer from a similar problem (for both
echotc and the termcap association). Are all termcap codes two
characters? If so, I think we can just add a couple of
   if (strlen(s) != 2 )) return 1/NULL
I can't see how else termcap.c goes wrong (no strncmp) so I'm assuming
that it is tgetent that only looks at the first two characters.
