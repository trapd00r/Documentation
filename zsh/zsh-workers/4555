`-W' behaves like `-k', you only need `compctl -W cdpath -/ cd'. There 
is some extra hacklet that ensures that the old style (giving one
directory) still works (in most cases): if the string isn't an
parameter name, it is used directly as a directory name. So, unless
you have a directory named `$cdpath' (*not* the value of `cdpath') it
will produce no matches.

This is a real bug (there really is an embarassing number of them,
sigh). The cursor should be moved on the suffix only when completing
inside words (paths, whatever).
