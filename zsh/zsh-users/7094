Is there going to be any effort to incorporate into 4.2 Clint's patch in
workers/16845, to link the libraries that only a module (and not the
main zsh binary) depends on only to the module and not the zsh binary?
It looks to me like the mail thread there had a little discussion, no
real problems were found, but then it was dropped.

Thanks,
Danek
