:I found a bug in the difflog.pl script when there were repeated entries
:for the same article number (e.g. 15060).  Here are additional differences
:in the "unposted" changes,  revealed by re-running the fixed script; I've
:edited a bit to remove obviously irrelevant parts.

OK, I reckon I'm up-to-date with my 4.0 pull ups.

(As for 4.1.*, I haven't yet done the docs for TRANSIENT_RPROMPT.  I'll
probably sit on the code for a week or so anyway before committing)

FYI:

:diff for unposted:
:+2001-10-05  Geoff Wing  <gcw@zsh.org>
:+
:+	* unposted: Doc/Zsh/options.yo: typo
:+

s/AUTO_CONT/AUTO_CONTINUE/  only relevant with 4.1.*

:+2001-08-15  Geoff Wing  <gcw@zsh.org>
 
Script bogon (unless that bit of the output was hand-edited). 
This matches my 4.0.* 2001-09-09 entry.
