User-Agent: T-gnus/6.14.1 (based on Gnus v5.8.3) (revision 16) SEMI/1.13.7 (Awazu) FLIM/1.13.2 (Kasanui) Emacs/20.6 (i686-pc-linux-gnu) MULE/4.0 (HANANOEN)

Completion functions for AIX and BSD were not installed.

Apart from that, zsh-3.1.7-pre-2.tar.gz doesn't contain them.  Why?
At least, `make targz-src' makes tarball which contains them when I
checked.
