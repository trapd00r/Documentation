It's a sparc 4 -- I use the prebuilt binary packages from the release
CDs (OpenBSD 3.2).  :^)  I've been too spoilt by modern CPUs ...

Okay, I've tried the change from:
 <URL:http://www.zsh.org/mla/workers/2002/msg01319.html>
(which should be zsh-workers/17910); the changed line is 461, as per
your mail, Bart.

It hasn't fixed the problem.  I tried reloading the function, then I
logged out and in again to ensure that the shell reloaded all functions
appropriately.

To be honest, I just commented out the zstyle line, since it was only
picked up by exploring the compinstall menus and going "oooh, shiny!".
So it's not currently affecting me unless I explictly try to test.  I'm
happy to test ideas, but is anyone else even seeing this behaviour?
