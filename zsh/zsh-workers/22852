Somewhat tangential to the ssh discussions:  since 22191 the users style
causes a complete list of users not to be generated.

(There weren't any complaints about that change back in February, but we
could do it a more flexible way by making it only ignore the system
users if the users variable began with a "-", say, or the other way
round: also include userdirs if the users style begins with a +.)
