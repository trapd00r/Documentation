Apart from the method that Peter has posted, if you have version 3.1.1
and have applied the patches that have been posted recently, the following
can be done:

bindkey "^P" run-pwd
zle -N run-pwd
function run-pwd {
  echo
  pwd
  zle redisplay
}

Presumably that patch will be in 3.1.2.  In a later version, there will
be a slightly more general solution, probably looking something like:

zle -N run-command
function run-command {
  zle trash-zle
  eval "$STACK"
  zle -s
}
bindkey -x "^P" run-command pwd
