    Hi Danek :)

 * Danek Duvall <duvall@emufarm.org> dixit:

    That's what I was looking for :))) I didn't find it in the
manual. I think I need more sleep. Or more caffeine. Or both O:)

    I have rcexpandparam enabled by default, but anyway I see no use
of it here, since (AFAIK), that option is for cases like FOO${array}BAR
expanding to FOOelement1BAR FOOelement2BAR instead of the more common
FOOelement1 element2BAR.

    Well, I didn't care so much about the globbing because I'm pretty
sure about the filenames, but yours is better.

    Thanks a lot!
