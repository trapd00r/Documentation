I doubt that. /cygdrive/r is pure virtual "directory" which means, any normal
file operation on it fails. Zsh probably tries to stat it.

fake-files was invented exactly to allow /cygdrive/x completion under cygwin.
It works nicely. Note, that it will work in *any* context where filename is
expected.
