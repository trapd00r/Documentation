Hi, zsh team!

Small bug in stderr redirection (this bug exists also in some verions of
ksh; my version of sh doesn't have it).

zsh version: 2.6-beta20
Host type: mips-sni-sysv4

Example:

% notexist 2> foo
%

I try to start not existing program with stderr redirection. One would
expect error message; instead I get nothing and error text is written into
foo. It is at least confusing; also the foo is corrupted in some sense.

I don't include any additional info; anyway zsh -f gives the same and
/etc/zshenv contains only PATH and MANPATH settings.

If you nedd any additional info, let me know. Let me know also if you
don't consider it a bug - I definitely do ;-)

greetings
