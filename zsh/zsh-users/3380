On Solaris, inet_pton and friends live in -lnsl.  -lnsl and -lresolv are not
both necessary, only the former.  And -lsocket seems to require -lnsl.

Configure seems to always do the right thing on Solaris with regard to the
networking libraries, though.  And I do have a version of zsh 3.1.9-dev-1
built on Solaris 8 with the 5.0 compilers ...
