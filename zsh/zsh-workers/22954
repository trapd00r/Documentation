If I run 'fg %n' with a job number that doesn't exist, it has
different (and worse) effects in a function than at a prompt.  (Sorry
if this has been fixed in CVS... Ubuntu Dapper doesn't have a package
past 4.2.5 yet.. ;) )

SpyderByte%   zsh -f
SpyderByte%   jobs

SpyderByte%   fg %1
fg: %1: no such job

SpyderByte%   test() { fg %1 }
SpyderByte%   test
test: can't set tty pgrp: operation not permitted

SpyderByte%   fg %1
fg: no job control in this shell.

SpyderByte%   zsh --version
zsh 4.2.5 (i686-pc-linux-gnu)
