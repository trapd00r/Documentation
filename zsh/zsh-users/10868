I believe that Mike Stroyan already offered this one -- probably a mail
delay somewhere holding up parts of the thread though.

Repeat the escape.

If the second character is the escape character, then it's sent on as
one character, so the second ssh process sees it.  So assuming that it's
not been changed with EscapeChar/-e, ~. for the first, ~~. for the
second, ~~~. for the third, etc.  For each ssh, all that matters is that
the ~ be the first _seen_ character typed after a newline.

More safely, ~? to see which escape sequences are offered, so that you
can check it's working without logging out, or ~^Z to suspend the login.
Knowing that one, for chained sessions, is a major productivity boost.
