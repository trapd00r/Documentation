Hi,
I checked out today the branch zsh-4_2-patches and tried to compile it. 
but it failed with builtin.c.
At 27. March 2007 Src/signals.c were changed in that branch, but not all 
dependents of it were changed enough. For example builtin.c and exec.c 
still calls settrap without flags and builtin.c tries to use sigfuncs.

Regards Andreas
