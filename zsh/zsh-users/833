A few days ago, I was hacking some C, with two colleagues.  As I write
quite fast, I often make mistakes, e.g. swap two letters, and such.
Zsh corrects me in many of these cases, so I just hit SPC and
continue.

In that case, I wanted to type `make', but I typed `amek' -- swapping
the first two and second two letters.  It went something like this:

{jagor}[~/labosi/jezpro]$ amek
zsh: correct 'amek' to 'make' [nyae]?  

Boy, were they impressed! :-)
