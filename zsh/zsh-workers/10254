Subject: Problems with _expand
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

I'm having problems with _expand in dev-20.

With the glob style set for the _expand completer things don't work anymore when expding something with ~ in it: if I do cd ~/<tab> nothing happens. I seem to remember that before, this left normal completion to go on but from tracing _expand, it seems to be trying to expand the ~ but not working. What should happen here - I'd prefer normal completion but at the very least, it should expand ~ and allow completion to carry on after that.

Oliver
