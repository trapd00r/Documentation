} Yeah.  My original patch wrote the commands out when they finished, but
} some folks were expecting the command to be present before it completed
} (when sharing the history among multiple shells), so I changed it.

It could write them beforehand with SHARE_HISTORY and afterwards with
only INC_APPEND_HISTORY.  But then the entries would be orded by the
end time rather than the start time in the latter case (not that it
should make any difference operationally).

Anyway, we still haven't managed to address Vincent's original complaint.
