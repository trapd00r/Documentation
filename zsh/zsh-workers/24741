     The command acts as a front end to the stat system call (see man
     page stat(2)).  The same command is provided with two names; as
     the name stat is often used by an external command it is
     recommended that only the zstat form of the command is used.  This
     can be arranged by loading the module with the command `zmodload
     -F zsh/stat zstat'.

schaefer<504> zmodload -F zsh/stat zstat
zsh: module `zsh/stat' has no such feature: `zstat'


I think it needs to say "b:zstat" ?
