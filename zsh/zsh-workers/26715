If someone wants to get the source before sf has their stuff fixed,
you can clone it from one of the git repos that have imported cvs. I
have one here:
git clone git://git.mika.l3ib.org/zsh-cvs.git
and there is one at
git clone git://repo.or.cz/zsh.git

(if you don't want the full history you can save about 3MB (out of
10MB) of transfer by giving --depth=1, or 7.5MB by doing (in a new
dir)
git init
git remote add origin git://theuri
git fetch --depth=1 origin master:refs/remotes/origin/master
git merge origin/master
)
