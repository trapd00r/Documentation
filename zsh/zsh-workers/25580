Personally, I dislike the 'wiki as a front-page' trend, but it gives _instant_
results. Another solution would be to take a random CMS, maybe
change the template a bit, and use that.

Static pages are somewhat outdated, compiled pages (think debian.org)
are a bit too much work to set up for a site of this size.
