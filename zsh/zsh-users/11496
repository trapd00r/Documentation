I am trying to find a way to disable the automatic execution of the
zsh/newuser module at startup for users without .z files. So far, the
only solution I have been able to find is to add this line to my
global zshenv file:

  zsh-newuser-install () {}

This seems like a kludge, though, and I was wondering if there was a
"right" way to do this?
