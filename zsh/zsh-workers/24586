} That's for "source"-able scripts, not executable ones.

This raises a question:  Why *isn't* it StartupFiles/newuser rather than
Scripts/newuser?

Then we could put sticky-note, zkbd, zcalc, and maybe checkmail and
harden, into Scripts/.  They'd still have to get installed into $fpath,
though ...

There's also run-help, which has a #! line although I'd be surprised if
anyone ever runs it as a script.  I'm *sure* that needs to be installed
into $fpath.
