Subject: [OT] Can anybody send mail to Karsten?
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

I tried sending a complaint about these silly "netlib syntax error" messages
that come back from every zsh-workers post, but I got a qconfirm quarantine
message from <karthy@karthy.net>.  Replying to the qconfirm message returns
a no-such-address error, so he's got something seriously misconfigured.

If any of you can regularly correspond with Karsten, or know of a way to get
someone else to read the equivalent of <zsh-workers-admin@sunsite.dk> and
take action, would you please request that the research.bell-labs.com address
be deleted from the subscriber list?

And if any of you happens to be a subscriber AT research.bell-labs.com, maybe
you could clarify which addresses are likely to be directed to the netlib
daemon?

Thanks.
