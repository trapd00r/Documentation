I'm sure I'm not the only System Administrator following these lists
who uses zsh.  I like zsh enough to make it the default shell for
users around here.  I've run zsh as root on a variety of systems,
without a problem.

It's been a more stable program than csh (to name a ``supported''
shell).  And it's plain cruel to take away the zsh TAB completion from
someone.  Typing at a command line is such a bother.

Hope that helps.
