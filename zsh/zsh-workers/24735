Clint, et al., please don't take this the wrong way, but:  This is
the second path-resolution-related change made for Debian and then
committed into the zsh dist that has caused portability issues.  I
think we need to start actively seeking out cross-platform testers
before accepting completion patches via the Debian bugs list.

Patches either in C code or using only built-in zsh features are
probably still OK.  So would be changes that go only into the
Completion/Debian/ directory.
