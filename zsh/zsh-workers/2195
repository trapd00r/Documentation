2.6-beta12.  One of my favourite new features, actually.

That sounds like a very nice thing to have.  (In fact, there's already
some code for execute-named-command that displays a temporary list
while a menu completion may already be in progress -- this could be
moved into a separate function in zle_tricky.c and made a bit more
complete in order to implement this feature.)  But I wouldn't want this
sort of listing to be on the usual list-choices etc. keys: it's useful
to be able to explicitly display the list one is menuing through.  It
would have to be a new command.
