Are those corrections likely to be limited to the Cygwin package for
zsh?

I don't use Cygwin myself but from a quick search, it looks like there
is an O_TEXT flag to open which we could use (a couple of places in
init.c would cover scripts I think). Wouldn't work where the script
comes from stdin, though. Does that perhaps help?
