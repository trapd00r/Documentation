If you use linux 1.3.x then probably your signames.h file is wrong since zsh
thinks that the signals are defined in <linux/signal.h> instead of
<asm/signal.h>.  You can get beta10-hzoli10.3, can wait for beta11 or you can
edit the Makefile under the Src dir and give SIGNAL_H proper value.  In this
case you should delete signames.h and do a make.
