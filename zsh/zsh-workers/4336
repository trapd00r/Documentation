Well, *this* example is even worse: in most cases people wouldn't type 
the uppercase version, but the lowercase one, agreed? Now, the full
rule for `ﬂ (es-zet) in an all-uppercase word' is: use `SS' if that
doesn't make the word ambiguous. E.g `Masse' becomes `MASSE' and
`Maﬂe' becomes `MAﬂE', even if it looks ugly.

So, a `ﬂ' on the line would have to match `ﬂ' and sometimes `SS'.


Bye
 Sven

P.S.: The new orthography rules for German remove the ﬂ entirely ;-)
