} I want to use %S and %s to invert the user name so I know I am on a
} remote system. While I can easily invert other colors, like light green
} ( $'%{\e[1;32m%}' ), I can't invert red.

Read again what Phil wrote.

$'%{\e[1;32m%}' is not "light green", it's "bold green" -- the "1" is
bold, the "32" is green.  Similarly, $'%{\e[0;31m%}' is not "red", it's
"turn everything else off" (0) and then "red" (31).  That first "0"
disables %S before it has a chance to do anything.  If you were to use
%S%{$'\e[31m'%} without the "0;" it would work as expected.
