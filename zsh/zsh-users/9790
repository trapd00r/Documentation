What if you could get the effect of find(1)'s "-nouser" and "-nogroup"
(true for files whose numeric UID and GID have no corresponding entry
in the passwd file) like this:

  print -l *(^u)
  print -l *(^g)

or maybe (to allow 'u' and 'g' clustering)

  print -l *(^u::)
  print -l *(^g::)

The latter would allow you to specify files that had both no user or
group owner.

I sometimes use "find / -nouser -o -nogroup" to locate files owned by
users or groups that have been removed from the system.

Thanks,

-Jonathan Hankins
