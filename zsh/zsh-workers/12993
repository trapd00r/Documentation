Hi Andrej,

Sorry for the false alarm, after upgrading cygwin (from b20,
embarrassingly enough) zsh works great...

Thanks so much for your efforts porting zsh to cygwin, I use windows
as little as possible but several people I work with do, and they will
certainly appreciate it, as will I whenever I'm helping one of them
out!  I guess now "bash" is completely without reason to exist...

Greg
