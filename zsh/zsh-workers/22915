The only case where this could possibly cause confusion is if someone

I don't think that's frequent enough, or the resulting problem severe
enough, to worry about.

No, it does not appear to work.  Try e.g.

zsh% while sleep 10; do : ; done
^Z
zsh: suspended  while sleep 10; do; :; done
zsh% bg ; echo $!
0
zsh%
