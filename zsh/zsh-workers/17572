Hello folks,

  just a note about the latest zsh module that appeared in my last cvs
update: zsh/net/socket

I'm surprised it's in a "network" directory. UNIX domain sockets have
nothing to do with networks, don't you think?

I agree it deals with communication, but only locally.

regards,
Stéphane
