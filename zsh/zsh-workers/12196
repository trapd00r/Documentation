Is there anything that ought to go in /etc/z* on more machines than,
say, those in a single company?  It seems to me that Red Hat and
other Linux distributions should be shipping with no (or empty)
/etc/{profile,z{sh{env,rc},profile,login},csh.*} files.  We *should*
add a README explaining how the existing example files are meant to
be used, and explaining why it's usually a bad idea to put anything in
global shell startup files.
