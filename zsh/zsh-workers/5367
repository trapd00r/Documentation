Subject: PATCH: 3.1.5-pws-8: Import to cvs should ignore version.h
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

As of 3.1.something, version.h is a generated file and shouldn't be imported.
I'd have sent this long ago, but I only recently noticed that the dists (even
the "real" 3.1.5) include .cvsignore files.
