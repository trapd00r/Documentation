Here's a possibly-helpful blog post from a few months ago:

http://www.heikkitoivonen.net/blog/2008/11/26/cygwin-upgrades-and-rebaseall/

} This may clear up with Cygwin-1.7, but I wouldn't bet on it.

The same google that turned up the above blog also finds mailing list
archives from 2004 where a Cygwin developer says that the "rebase"
utility is a temporary workaround for something that should become
automatic in setup.exe.
