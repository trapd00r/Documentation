    Very GOOD trick, Bart :) As always, I'm not aware of the pattern
comparisons. I use them sometimes, but...

    It is treated specially in the script, but the problem is that if
the caller passes '--' just after an option which requires an
argument, it is consumed as the argument :( If I have to do special
processing of every option and argument, I better get rid of getopts
and do the processing by hand. I prefer to eat '--' in OPTARG, test
if it is a valid argument for the option and issue a fail.

    Anyway you're right, I should 'search' for '--' just before doing
any processing (just the same I search for '--help' at the very
beginning of the script) and pass 'getopts' only the set of options
before the '--', while consider the others as non options (filenames
in this particular case). As far as I know, the SUS standard require
'getopts' to treat '--' specially as marking the end of options

    Doing the job by hand is something I've been considering, because
that way I will have full control, and the only thing I loose is the
ability of doing "script -xyz" meaning "script -x -y -z" (I can
implement that, but I'm not sure if it is worth the effort).

    Thanks for all your help Bart :)
