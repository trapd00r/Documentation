That's correct.

The right way to do this is:

1. Create a directory with your functions in them, each with the same name as
   the function.  Call this ~/zsh_functions, for example.  (The standard
   zsh format is for only the body of the function to be in the file,
   but if it's all surrounded by funcname() { ... } it will still work.)

2. In your ~/.zshenv, add

   fpath=(~/zsh_functions $fpath)
   autoload ~/zsh_functions/*(:t)
