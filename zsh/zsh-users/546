No, it's much simpler than that, as Zoltan pointed out to me by private
e-mail. It has to do with with the BAUD setting of the terminal which is
automatically set when the shell starts up. This setting should be set
to 0 when using and xterm or console on the local machine.

export BAUD=0 # that's what I did and everything works like a charm

Cheers.
