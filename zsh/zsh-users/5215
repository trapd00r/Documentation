From: Peter Stephenson <pws@csr.com>

I've uploaded 4.0.5 to ftp.zsh.org.  Could a few people try this over
the weekend before I go through the palaver at sourceforge and
freshmeat?

There are very few additions to functionality in this, mostly some
completion functions and Zle widgets.  There are a lot of small
bugfixes.  See the ChangeLog for the full details.
