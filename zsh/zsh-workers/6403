Subject: weird bus errors with zsh-3.1.5-pws-20 ?


zsh pws20 was giving me a bus error

Now I can't figure out why it stopped.

NOTE: my login shell is /usr/bin/zsh which is a symlink to  
/usr/bin/zsh-3.1.5-pws-20


# gdb /usr/bin/zsh-3.1.5-pws-20

GDB 4.7 (NeXT 3.1), Copyright 1992 Free Software Foundation, Inc...
Reading symbols from /usr/bin/zsh-3.1.5-pws-20...(no debugging symbols  
found)...done.

(gdb) run

I can't, for some reason, reproduce this now, and I can't figure out why it  
happened.

If I try to 'strip zsh' it doesn't seem to have an effect -- should it?
