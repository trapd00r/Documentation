Speaking of which, a few of my recent fixes should really go onto the
patch branch.  Shall I get some approval first?  I'd particularly like
to apply the anti-truncation fixes in 16890 and users/4678, the unposted
HISTSIZE-can't-go-below-2 fix, and possibly the latter half of 16703
(which made the "history" command better in boundary conditions).
