Hello all,

I've started to use zsh 2 days ago on my FreeBSD Desktop, this is a
really great shell.

I've written 2 Completions, and I would like to share it with the
community, how can I send this to be added in the project?

These completions are specific to FreeBSD, is about "csup" and "portsnap".

Thanks
