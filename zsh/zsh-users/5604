Hi all,

i'm trying to use the windows port of zsh but has some pb :

1) is there a way to launch zsh in a ansi compliant terminal ? it would
be great to have a colored ls.
2) please have a look to this ouput : the string '\b' is understood as a
backslash. I don't know how to tell zsh to escape it.

C:/bin>echo $ZSH_VERSION
3.0.5-nt-beta-0.75
C:/bin>cat wpkg
#!/bin/sh

#setopt winntignorecase w
echo $#
echo $*
echo $0
echo $1
C:/bin>wpkg toto
1
toto
cin\wpkg <<<<<<<<< HERE is the pb ... real string is c:\bin\wpkg
toto
C:/bin>

Last thing : is there a chance to see a new release of zsh under windows
? Currently, it's the only one good native shell under windows.

Marc
