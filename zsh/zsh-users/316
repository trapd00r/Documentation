is it possible to match for ytalk with the standard completion flags?
here's the argument synopsis for ytalk:
    name          - some user on your machine
    name@host     - some user on a different machine
    name#tty      - some user on a particular terminal
    name#tty@host - some user on a particular tty on a different machine
    name@host#tty - same as "name#tty@host"
I could complete for users easily enough... but i'd like to also match
the others with something like an 's[]' construct with pattern maching
so i could match ttys after a # in the field and/or hostnames after an @ 
in a field.
this could be used for just about anything that specifies an email address
and would also be useful in completions for programs like 'dd'.
