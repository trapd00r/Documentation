Yes, I get those same results. However, in an interactive shell:

% ulimit -t 0
% ( ulimit -t; while :; do :; done )
0
<< watch the CPU time used climb in top >>
^C
%
...
% ulimit -Ht 0
% ( ulimit -t; while :; do :; done )
0
zsh: killed     (; ulimit -t; while :; do; :; done; )
%

My first thought was: is zsh blocking SIGXCPU in some circumstances? But
killing the process with kill -XCPU worked fine.

It therefore appears  that while the manpage is correct for hard limits,
soft limits of 0 are still treated as unlimited.
