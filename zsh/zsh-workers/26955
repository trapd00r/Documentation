I tried this on two of the lesser-used modules, namely complist and
zutil, but it made no difference.  It's possible I put the "zmodload
-u" too early, but I can't see a better place than the end of the tests
that do the loading.  I see no problems running zmodload interactively.

P.S.  A tiny documentation nit -- zmodload says modules are usually call
.sl on HPUX, which is true, however the HP build names them .so's anyway.
