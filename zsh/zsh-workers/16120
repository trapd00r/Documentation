I tried to compile yodl but I could not get past ./configure

So I tried commenting out all commands that mentioned doc in the Makefile, 
and in some places deleted the word doc.

I managed to get to make install but at the end of that I got this.

rm -f /usr/local/bin/zsh.new
ln /usr/local/bin/zsh-4.1.0-dev-2 /usr/local/bin/zsh.new
mv /usr/local/bin/zsh.new /usr/local/bin/zsh
if test x/usr/local/share/zsh/4.1.0-dev-2/functions != x && test 
x/usr/local/share/zsh/4.1.0-dev-2/functions != xno; then \
   test x/usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions != xno && \
     /bin/sh ./mkinstalldirs /usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions; \
   sdir_top="." fndir="/usr/local/share/zsh/4.1.0-dev-2/functions"

   INSTALL_DATA="/usr/bin/install -c -m 644" \
   DESTDIR="" VERSION="4.1.0-dev-2" \
   /bin/sh ./Config/installfns.sh || exit 1; \
fi; \
exit 0
mkdir /usr/local/share/zsh
mkdir /usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions
mkdir /usr/local/share/zsh/4.1.0-dev-2
mkdir /usr/local/share/zsh/4.1.0-dev-2/functions
make: *** No rule to make target `install.man', needed by `install'.  
Stop.

BTW, would it be helpful if I posted the text of some of these file on the 
web, if so you can tell me what files to put on the web.
