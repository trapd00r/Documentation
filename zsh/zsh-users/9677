Hi,
I have shell utility which stores information (between sessions) in a series of text files. I now
want to do something more complicated, and realise I should be considering using a database.
I then ran smack into a steep learning curve.
Is there a shell accessible database? gdbm?
Pointers please, examples if possible

(I realise this thread may not be particularly zshish)
