The "special" traps, the ones that don't map directly to signals, are
handled differently from others; in particular because of its relationship
with functions, TRAPEXIT is effectively always local.  (The other special
traps, SIGZERR and SIGDEBUG, don't have this kind of specialness, but they
have others.)
