Hello,

I'm trying to write some function to distribute my config files among all
the machines I use.  For various reasons, I dont want to use rsync or CVS.
I want to "push" the files out from my main machine, so I have a function
which tars them up and scp's them to the remote machine (prompting for a
password if necessary)

I also have a function which installs the config files properly, from a
tar file in my home directory.  The problem is now executing that function
remotely, via ssh.

The best I've come up with is:

$ ssh remote-host zsh -i -c function

which runs the function, but also outputs:

stty: standard input: Invalid argument

is there a way to do this better?  

Thanks,

Scott
