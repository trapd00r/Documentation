array=(${(f)"$(<filename)"})

$(<filename)
  Substitute the file.
"..."
  The substitution is performed as a single command line argument.
${(f)...}
  Split the result into one element per line (a pseudo-parameter-substitution;
  they allow command substitutions, too).  (Sometimes you see an @ next to
  the f to tell it the result is an array; this is harmless but unnecessary
  in this case.)

There are lots of examples like this in the completion code, except most
are about fifty times more complicated.
