This series adds features to the hg and git backends of vcs_info.
It also fixes a bug in the hg backend in connection with very recent
mercurial versions.

There are no changes in the default behaviour of any backend.


Frank Terbeck (5):
  vcs_info: add revision and "misc" argument to VCS_INFO_formats()
  Add git's sha1 hash as revision information
  Add information about hg's local revision number and the commit's hash
  contrib.yo: updates for get-revision, %i and %m

    The four patches above add features to the git and hg backends,
    including documentation.

  Make the hg backend work with new versions of mercurial

    This one fixes a problem with detecting hg freshly created hg
    repositories with very recent mercurial versions, which don't
    seem to create .hg/branch if there's only the 'default' branch.
    Reported by Andreas Korsten.
