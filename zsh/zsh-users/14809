Hmm.  Thanks, that's useful.

Then I guess my question is more PCRE-specific than I'd thought...  Is 
PCRE "usually" available?  (For some "most distros"/"most OS'es"/"most 
users" value of "usually")  Or should I just code up the 'fallback' path 
in my other example (since I'd have to code it anyway for the the 
doesn't-have-PCRE case)?
