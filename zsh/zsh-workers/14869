I'm pretty sure the last time I used AIX almost two years ago this wasn't a
problem.  Certainly the arguments were different but I don't think there
were any other problems.

I may have simply forgotten, but I certainly used gcc/g++ for a lot of
other things on AIX and I probably would remember if something was
seriously wrong.  Can't find anything in the mailing list archive
indicating which I was using.

If this version of AIX can be tricked into working even only with cc, I
will release the result as 4.0.2.
