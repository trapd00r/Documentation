I am wondering if this an intentional feature or a bug.  I am running
3.1.5...

When you type 'cd <old> <new>' on the command line, zsh replaces
only the FIRST occurance of <old> in the directory. I've actually run
into situations where <old> occurs more than once in $PWD, and I'd
like <new> to replace this second occurance of old.

I am requesting that <new> replace ALL occurances of <old> in $PWD, not
just the first one.

Thanks.

- Larry
