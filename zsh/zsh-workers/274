I can't for the life of me figure out how to make zsh report when I have new
mail.  I've tried setting MAILCHECK to various numbers, MAIL to my system
mailbox (in my case ~/.mail) and mailpath to a colon-seperated list of the
mailboxes I want checked.  But nothing I've done has worked.  Is there some
trick to this, or am I missing something obvious?

Thanks,
Dan Eisenbud
