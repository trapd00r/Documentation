Thanks.  Actually, I was relying on the failure being silent,
otherwise what I was trying to do (suppress an error message from a
bad assignment in a system script I couldn't access) wouldn't work.
However, this corresponds to what ksh does.  I suppose I can't expect
unsupported hacks to work.  The script's now been fixed anyway.
