It occurs to me that with the unambiguous (#q...) syntax for qualifiers
with the extendedglob option set, it would be possible to allow things
like

  ls *(#q@)/*

Currently the qualifiers there just get ignored, so there's no
ambiguity.

I haven't looked at the code and don't know if it would be useful enough
to justify the effort.  It's not particularly readable!
