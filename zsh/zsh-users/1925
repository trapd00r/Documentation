Use alias ls='nocorrect ls' etc. Not ideal I know, but I too get lots of
unwanted corrections on NT.

set SAVEHIST too. eg SAVEHIST=1000

Quite right too. Are you using Amol Deshpande's native win32 port or a
cygwin compiled version? If the former, you might want to add
setopt winntignorecase winntlamepathfix to your .zshrc and you'll
need special bindings to get the arrow keys to work properly (see
Amol's docs). 

The only relatively big problem I have under NT is that command line
editing breaks when the terminal is very wide.
