No, it can't. :-)  However, years ago, I had a program called "ile"
(input line editor) that could add editing capabilities to arbitrary
commands.  It wouldn't be hard to write a modern version of this
command using something like gnu readline attached to a pty in which
was running some interactive command....  I wonder how hard it would
be to get zsh to do something like this.

Wow.... me too. :-)
