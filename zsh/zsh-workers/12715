That's a commit log message, so it's very likely that the URLs are
generated by a commitlog script at the time the files are checked in.  
It's entirely possible that a similar script is available at sourceforge
to work with their (slightly modified, IIRC) cvsweb server.

We'd need to decide where to have those commit logs mailed [*] and then be
very careful to make exactly one commit per "patch", including all the
affected files.

[*] Not back to zsh-workers, I think -- perhaps to a sourceforge-hosted
mailing list that we'd set up to get nothing but commit logs?
