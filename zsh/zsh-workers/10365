It is, although not very clearly: (from mod_zle.yo)

  xitem(tt(bindkey) [ var(options) ] tt(-l))
  ...
  In the binding operations, if the tt(-R) option is used, the var(in-string)s
  are interpreted as ranges, instead of plain strings.  A valid range
  consists of two characters, with an optional `tt(-)'
  between them.  All characters between the two specified, inclusive,
  are bound as specified.

So I guess -R is one of the var(options).

Bye
 Sven
