It is desirable to minimize the number of special parameters sice it is
quite difficult to handle special parameters in some cases.  It can be
arranged that HISTCHARS will only work if zsh is not called as sh/ksh but
is it really necessary?  HISTCHARS did not even work originally since in
many places in the source ! was used explicitely instead of bangchar (but
it worked for hashchar I know).
