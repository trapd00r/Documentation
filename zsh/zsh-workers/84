After many months of happily using zsh-2.6-beta2, I just grabbed 
zsh-2.6-beta9 from math.gatech.edu and tried to compile it.  My first
attempt was unsuccessful, because somewhere between b2 and b9,

"EXTERN char *zlogname;" in globals.h, init.c, and params.c

was changed to

"EXTERN char *logname;"

which conflicts with logname(3), declared

"char *logname(void);" in <unistd.h>

(this is on HPUX 9.05 HP9000/715).

May I recommend that you revert to "zlogname"??

And many thanks for your efforts.  I have become very fond of zsh.

(Incidentally, I am not a subscriber to this list.)
