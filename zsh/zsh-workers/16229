Not surprising.  You basically have to emulate the action of the printf
implementation.  This is why some C libraries have snprintf() which will
return the length of the result without actually doing the print.

I suggest you punt:  Just fprintf() to a temp file and then read it back.
If you wanted to get really fancy you could memory-map the file where
that is supported.
