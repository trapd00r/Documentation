Awesome - thanks!

Huge favor - could the zshparam man page please be updated to
reflect this? I didn't see anything about it in the subscript flags section.

Also, while I'm requesting updates to the man page, I wanted to point
out a couple of typos I found if anybody wants to correct them.

On the zshparams man page, under the subscript flags section, there is
an identical typo that appears twice:

On the first line of both the 'w' and 'f' subscript flags, the text reads:

"If the parameter subscripted is a scalar than this flag makes"

The 'than' should probably be 'then'. Sorry to be anal. ;)

- Larry
