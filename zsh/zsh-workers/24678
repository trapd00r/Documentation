That seems to me useless.  I can understand in C that a string is a
low-level entity consisting of a set of bytes, but I don't see why a
shell should force the user to count the size of a multibyte character
in the particular locale.

You can fix it by unsetting the MULTIBYTE option.

printf() { emulate -L zsh; unsetopt multibyte; builtin printf "$@" }
