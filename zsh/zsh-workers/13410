So I'm not the only idiot. Good.

This happened to me, too. Somehow the Makefile calls the recursive
`make's twice when collection the module object files to be put into
stamp-modobjs. Since I don't really understand that part of the
Makefile anymore, I just added a `sort -u' in the rule that checks if
the new stamp-modobjs.tmp differs from existing stamp-modobjs. But I'm 
pretty sure this isn't the right way to solve it.

Then I forgot to mention it on the list. Sorry.

So... Zefram? Anyone?

Bye
 Sven
