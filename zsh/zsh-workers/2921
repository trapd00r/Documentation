I have the following in my .zshrc, which accomplishes what you want.
However it still leaves me wondering why this is not the default
behavior.  (Ksh's emacs mode is bound like GNU emacs's.)

bindkey -me
bindkey '\Mf' emacs-forward-word
bindkey '\MF' emacs-forward-word
bindkey '\M^h' backward-kill-word
