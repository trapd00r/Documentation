Subject: Anybody know what's going on in xsymlinks()?  [utils.c]
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

To apply patch 7114 to 3.0.6-pre-5, I first applied it to 3.1.6-test-1 and
then ediff'd the utils.c files.  In the course of doing so, I discovered
that the xsymlinks() functions are different in the two versions.  Each is
(independently) unchanged as far back as my own archives go, and apparently
no patch was ever posted (unless it predates the archives on www.zsh.org),
so either this is something that Zefram privately added to 3.1.2 or so, or
else the 3.0.5 code is an old change that didn't get propagated into 3.1.x.
I can't find a likely-looking entry in either ChangeLog to explain it.

Does anyone know which it is?
