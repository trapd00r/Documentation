One of my favourite pastimes is currently to think about doing to zle
what we've done to the completion system. I.e. reduce the internals to 
the basics (unlike completion, most things are already there for zle)
and then shell functions...

Then we would be able to use as many styles as possible, of course.

(I'm not very happy looking up styles from the C code and have avoided 
it until now, because it would defeat functions that define a zstyle
shell function to get at the styles used... and things like that.)

Ideally, we should probably put even more things into C-code
(mailcheck comes to mind). But non of this before 4.0, of course.


Hm, probably not very helpful, this `answer', sorry ;-}

Bye
 Sven
