Hi there,

after about six months of using about 0.01% of the goodies zsh offers,
I decided it was time to checkout compinit. The exploration ended up
before it started with an error I don't know what to think about (I can
read some basic shell scripting, but that's about it). Also note that
I've searched the archives, but only found unrelated messages.

roman@roman ~ > autoload -U compinit                               101:0
roman@roman ~ > compinit                                           102:0
roman@roman ~ > tar xzf sub^I                                      103:0
_normal:26: bad math expression: operator expected at `0 '

At this moment, I'm supposed to be impressed. :)

    24    return ret
    25  else
    26    if (( $+builtins[$command] + $+functions[$command] )); then
    27      cmd1="$command"
    28      curcontext="${curcontext%:*:*}:${cmd1}:"
    29    elif [[ "$command[1]" = '=' ]]; then

It does that for ^I completion as well. What's up?
