} A pure user-code solution would be to use a match spec such as 'm:=\\'

} interactions with complex match specs, I'll have to test that.

What happens if the file name (or whatever else is being completed)
actually *contains* a backslash?  I.e. the backslash isn't just there
to quote some other special character.
