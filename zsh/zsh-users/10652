cat file | awk 'BEGIN {print_next = 0;} {if (print_next) {print $0;
   print_next = 0;}} /PATTERN/ {print_next = 1;}'

Here's an awk solution.  If your line matches PATTERN, it sets a flag.
When the next record is read, the flag is evaluated.  If set, the record
is printed.

This solution allows for a single line to both be printed and match.
