Is this any of the issues mentioned in the MACHINES file?

SGI: IRIX 6.2, 6.3, 6.5
	[Out of date.]

	Should build `out-of-the-box'.

	On 6.5.2, zsh malloc routines are reported not to work; also
	full optimization (cc -O3 -OPT:Olimit=0) causes problems.

	If using the SGI compiler, variable length arrays need to
	be turned off.  configure can work this out for itself if it
	is passed the option --enable-cflags='-LANG:vla=off -O' (combined
	with other flags if necessary).

	The zpty module is not currently supported.  This causes the
	tests starting `Y' in the Test directory to fail, even though
	the features to be tested are working.
