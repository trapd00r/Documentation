I'm not sure what you mean... 

If you want to say that exactly that compctl doesn't work for you --
it does for me (well, something similar, I don't have a Debian system
here).

If you want to say that it doesn't complete the right thing after
loading the new completion system -- right, there doesn't seem to be a 
completion function for these commands.

If you want to say that after loading the new completion system the
compctl doesn't seem to be used -- right, see the function _default
in the Base subdirectory of the distribution. You can un-comment a
call to `compcall' there to make compctl's be used when there is no
completion function for a certain command.


Or maybe you meant something completely different...

Bye
 Sven
