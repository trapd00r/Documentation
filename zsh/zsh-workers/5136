} But don't rely on that too long.

According to http://www.dorkslayers.com/, quote:

    The Dorkslayers.com/ORBS web site and service has been terminated.

    A new project is under way to provide a service to replace ORBS.
    Announcements will be made in appropriate places when this service
    is available. Thank you for your patience.
