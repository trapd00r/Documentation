That's not what I meant.  We're talking about doing globbing.  A normal
regexp engine answers questions of the form "does this string match this
pattern?", but for globbing we need an engine that can answer "what are
all the filenames that match this pattern?".  libzglob would really have
to contain its own globbing engine -- Perl currently doesn't have one,
though it has a good regexp engine.
