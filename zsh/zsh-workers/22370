As I said, there's room for an extension to select your own main and
alternate keymaps similar to vared, but this is the first step.

I meant "without rewriting the function", but yes, if you want to alter
replace-string that would be fine.

Only because of existing practice... options restricted to the widget
(like -n and -N) have tended to come after it.  The latter is another
possibility.  I think I marginally prefer the former anyway, unless you
have a strong preference, since the latter looks to me like an
additional argument to the keymap-setting function, rather than a widget
called in a particular context.

Also it's not *so* much easier to do it via bin_zle_keymap(), since you
need to restore the keymap afterwards, and you probably want the return
status of the widget rather than what zle -K would normally
return... but this is all fairly minor.
