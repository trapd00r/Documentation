Subject: fortran completion
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Content-Disposition: inline

Hi! I have a program which needs to do autocompletion for fortran
source code. Right now I am using
compdef '_files -g "*.f*"' f90.sh
but I would like to have something more robust or official. I see that
for gfortran, autocompletion works, but I cannot seem to file relevant
function. (neither _gfortran no _fortran etc.)

Could some please tell me what is the function used for gfortran (or a
function for fortran files)?
