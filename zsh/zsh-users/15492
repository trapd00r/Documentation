} Cool idea, nicer if I could have  aright justify, trid using ^M for a 
} newline and it puts the newline on the left.

How about:

    zle-line-init() {
      print -nR $terminfo[sc]$terminfo[home]"$REMINDER"$terminfo[rc]
    }
    zle -N zle-line-init

Then anything stored in the shell parameter REMINDER will be shown at
the top left of the screen.  Of course it'll begin to scroll off if you
have a multi-line command.

Replace sc/rc with tsl/fsl to use the status line if your terminal has
one (which you can test for by examining $terminfo[hs]).
