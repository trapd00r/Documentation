One kluge idea for bourne-shell emulation mode:  automatically add an
invisible global alias for ${1+"@"} (i.e. don't list it if the user asks
for a list of aliases).  We'd also want to make sure that we allow the
user to turn it into a visible global alias if they manually add one.
This would just serve to improve our bourne-shell emulation without
trying to fix the underlying problem.
