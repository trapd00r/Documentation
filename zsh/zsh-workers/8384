Ah ha ha.  That's an artifact of the "make ftp-dist" action.  I failed
to notice when changing the old pattern:

	zsh-$(VERSION)/**/RCS/*,v(D:s@RCS/@@:s/,v//)

to the new:

	zsh-$(VERSION)/**/*(D^@)

that the new pattern would produce directory names, where the old did not.
So tar happily packs up the "Doc" directory, and then individually packs
up each of the files inside it.  Sigh.

The 3.0.6 tarfile probably has the same oddity.  Harmless, if a bit of a
waste of space.
