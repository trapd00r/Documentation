I get weird behaviour with print.  If I print a variable which is
something like below, I get a complaint from it.

=== $ echo $CTAGS
--langmap=c:.c.ec.y.l --c-types=cdefgmnstuvx --kind-long=yes
=== $ print $CTAGS
zsh: bad option: -a
zsh: exit 1
=== $ print --------l hello world
hello
world
=== $ 

Is this a bug?  It certainly is unexpected behaviour.
