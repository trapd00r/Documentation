(I take it that should be `script' rather than `function' in the subject
line, functions are OK.)

I don't think there's any good reason why zle shouldn't be enabled
especially, if it can find a terminal which it can, but until whoever made
the change takes a look you can workaround it by giving zsh the -i option
to run the script interactively.  That might have other side effects,
though.
