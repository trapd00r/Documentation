----- Forwarded message from Andrew Pimlott <andrew@pimlott.net> -----

When a job is still running and the CHECK_JOBS is set, zsh should only
exit when it receives two exit requests in a row.  However, sometimes it
honors an exit request in other conditions.  One repeatable case is when
the request is a Control-D and there was only one command run since the
last exit request.  The following illustrates (<C-D> stands for pressing
Control-D):

    % vi

    zsh: suspended  vi
    % exit
    zsh: you have suspended jobs.
    % true
    % exit
    zsh: you have suspended jobs.
    % true
    % true
    % <C-D>
    zsh: you have suspended jobs.
    % true
    % <C-D>
    <shell exits>

I have accidentally logged out with my mail open several times because
of this.

Andrew
