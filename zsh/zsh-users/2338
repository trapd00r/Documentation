SUGGESTION

Adding a new filename qualifier that limits filename generation to
only ASCII files.

WHY

I want to grep through a bunch of files for a string. The problem is
that grep will look in binaries and spew a bunch of garbage to my
terminal. Now, one COULD use the executable qualifier and negate it,
but this wouildn't work in some cases. I think a qualifier would be
more suitable. (Not to mention helpful!)

Comments?
