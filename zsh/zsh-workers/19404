    Hi Alexey :)

 * Alexey Tourbin <at@altlinux.ru> dixit:
> I've got rather similar problem with pty handling (zpty).

    The problem in my case (not the tests one) was that although
Linux (glibc I mean) supports PTMX, zsh believes that it doesn't.

    I still have no clue about the cause of the zsh tests failing...

    None (correctly)

> zpty job1 date

    None (correctly)

> zpty -r job1

    Sun Feb 1 00:48:34 CET 2004 (yes, I know, I should be sleeping...).

    Hope that helps. If you need more information, let me know.
