Hello,

I need some help here and maybe someone of you can help.

Supposing that I have this directory structure:

dir -+- backup -+- file.1
     |          +- file.2
     |          +- anotherfile.txt
     |          +- dont_backup
     +- index.txt

And index.txt is:
file*
another*

I want to create an archive for the files that are matched by the contents of
index.txt


I tried in dir/ to run the command:

zip backup.zip $(<index.txt)

but that didn't worked because the file* another* weren't expanded. How do
I tell him(zsh 3.1.5) to expand the result of $(<index.txt)?

Thanks!
