Hi
I want to zip up 50 or so very large files into 4 huge zip files.


The problem is that the files themselves are all very different sizes, I want 
to find a way of splitting up the list of files into four lists so that the 
size of the resulting zips are roughly the same size.
  
(I don't want to use split zips)

Ideas?
