Thanks for that -I option, I wouldn't have guess it's utility : ). It
works like I wanted, althought it seems to take some time to be active
:
[22:15] :~$ zsh
north.~% <CTRL-O> # Bind widg0 to ^D
north.~% <CTRL-D>
zsh: use 'exit' to exit.
north.~% <CTRL-D>
Deactivating ...

It does : "eof =3D ^D;"
It exits the shell for me too, but prints this message "zsh: use
'exit" to exit", so I'm guessing I'm still doing something wrong.

Moreover, I manage to get a segfault error by using virtualenwrapper
and wigets, but that's another story.

Thanks fo your help !
