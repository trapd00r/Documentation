  zstyle ':completion:*:*:cd:*' tag-order local-directories

will do this for you. Or you could use:

  zstyle ':completion:*:*:cd:*' tag-order local-directories path-directories

to only complete directories from $cdpath when no local directories match.

In any context where more than one type of thing is completed, you can
press ^Xh and it will list the tags used for completion in that context
and you can specify the order for them to be completed.

  zstyle ':completion:*:*:cd:*' ignored-patterns '(|*/)(.svn|CVS)'

If I remember correctly, the ignored-patterns style is implemented by
adding -F.

Not sure. The preferred way is that we don't ever and a zstyle is made
to do the job.

Please do share it.
