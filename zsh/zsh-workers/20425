A quick test suggests the performance is perfectly acceptable with a
typical makefile.  I haven't gone into much detail.

I did notice that this target:

  builds/$(CONFIG)/stamp-builddir

gets shortened to

  builds//stamp-builddir

I realise there it's not likely to be able to do the substitution
properly, but I'm not sure why it's doing it at all.  (The basic
substitution problem is the same for include files.)

However, none of this is any worse than in the old system; in fact, it
appears to find a lot more targets and be better about stripping
colons.  So I can't see any reason not to use it.
