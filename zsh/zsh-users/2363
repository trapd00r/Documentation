} 3.0.x is really quite old now and I know that there is some really nice

We've got separate people maintaining the two releases now, so there's
little conflict in keeping both updated.

} Then again, it may be that there's still a while to go before 3.1.x

There's a lot of very new stuff in 3.1 now which hasn't had exposure except
to the developers list, so there probably is a while to go.  One concern is
to get out a Y2K-fixed 3.0 to be included in various linux releases etc.
before 3.2 reaches fruition.
