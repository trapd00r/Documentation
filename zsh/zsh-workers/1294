I have noticed that when I set HISTSIZE (the maximum size of the
history list) in zsh to something huge, zsh takes huge amounts of
memory.

When I converted from bash, I have easily ported all the init files,
and HISTSIZE caused terrible problems (especially since I didn't know
HISTSIZE was causing them). The reason I set HISTSIZE to such a big
value is just to keep it from bothering me -- it is just a *maximum*
value I am changing. In bash it worked exactly that way (no additional
memory expense). But it seems that the organization of history storage
requires resizehistevents() to reallocate the list to HISTSIZE history
entries.

I wonder how difficult would it be to patch hist.c in such a way that
the actual size of the history list changes dynamically, HISTSIZE
being only an upper limit to that change.
