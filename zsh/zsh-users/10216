I mentioned my update back on March 25th in a message entitled "Updating
the zsh.sourceforge.net website".  In it I asked if I was doing the
right thing or not, and got no negative responses.  Apparently I failed
to read the pretty obvious trailing section that talked about sunsite
and gave an address for the website maintainers (ouch).

Since the pages have gotten pretty far out of date, perhaps it would be
better to have the pages on SF become the master pages so that anyone on
the zsh project can edit them?  Or perhaps some kind of a wiki system
should be put in place?  What do people think?

It would be good if the updates made to the SF pages could be propagated
to the sunsite pages somehow -- who can do this?
