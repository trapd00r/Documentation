Just try it in /usr/bin or /bin: ls TAB. There are interesting things:

- first, the list is built in "steps"; it outputs part of the screen then
delay then another part. Delays happen somewhere in the middle of a word (I
suspected slow stat() at first, but it does not appear to be it).

- after list is shown, cursor movement is noticeably slow (I was about to say
"painfully" ...).

May be, it is related to memory management; I have seen reports that bash also
behaves slow under Cygwin as compared with Unix.
