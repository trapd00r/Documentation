Well, I considered suggesting that we comprehend bash prompt sequences,
but then decided that was going too far.  What I meant, I guess, was
"closer than it's currently possible to get by running 'emulate'".

Yes, that's exactly the issue.  Regardless of the size or complexity of
the job to alter the C code, it's unreasonable if the result introduces
more script bugs than it fixes incompatibilities.
