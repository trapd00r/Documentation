This is due to the lines 464-467 of configure.ac:

dnl Default preprocessing on Mac OS X produces warnings
case "$host_os" in
   darwin*) CPP="$CPP -traditional-cpp" ;;
esac

I don't know when and why this is added. It seems -traditional-cpp is
not required already on Leopard (darwin9.x.x), but maybe it would be
better to modify only for Snow Leopard (darwin10.x.x).

On Snow Leopard, _FORTIFY_SOURCE is defined to 2 by default, and
stdio.h and string.h include files under /usr/include/secure/.
This adds some buffer overflow checks, as in the case of strncpy().
But some macros in /usr/include/secure/_stdio.h can't be processed
by gcc -E -traditional-cpp, and causes the above warning from configure.
