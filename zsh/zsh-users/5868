I need to get a list of directories that have .java files in them.  Here is
the snipplet:

for i ( $sourcePath ) {
  for j ( $i/**/*(-/) ) {
    setopt localoptions
    setopt nullglob
    unsetopt globsubst
    tempArr=( $j/*.java )

    if (( $#tempArr >= 1 )); then
      temp=${j#$i/}
      temp=${temp//\\//.}
      packages=( $packages $temp )
    fi
  }
}

It was taking quite a while to glob through all the .java files.  But it was
even slower to use the subshell method (like you suspected).  Ohh well.
