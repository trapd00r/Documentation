I just joined this mailing list to research this very problem.

fchdir is also not implemented on Ultrix, SCO v3.2, and AIX 3.2.5, as far
as I can tell.  I tried scanning the archives for patches that might
rectify this, but possibly I missed something.

If there is any solution for this problem I would appreciate hearing about
it.
