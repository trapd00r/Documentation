Hi Bart,

Oops, interesting.

Uh, oh, don't ask me.  I hardly know anything about the zsh completion
system (yet).  Anyone else want to comment Barts discoveries?

I wasn't able to find anything about the mailbox-style in the docs.  :-(
What can I set with it?

Oh, okay...together with your patch (which is basically what I did too :-)
But of course that doesn't work for the aliases, which are in ~/.mutt/aliases.
Hm, while just looking at _mutt I see that mailaddresses are taken from
'recipient:->userhost', which I don't understand.  Where is that info
being set?  Or in other words: how can I influence the list of addressees?

Thanks,
 Andy.
