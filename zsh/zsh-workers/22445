Zsh became pretty much impossible to compile with pre-ANSI C
compilers along about the time the dev version number changed to
3.1.  You might have better luck building zsh-3.0.8, which I
believe is still available from the sourceforge downloads page.

} popularly known as strtod() and which AWK considered essential.

Are you entirely sure this was a successful imitation?  Looking
ahead at your configure output:

} checking where signal.h is located... ./configure: 27790 Memory fault - core dumped
} /usr/include/sys/signal.h
} checking where error names are located... ./configure: 27841 Memory fault - core dumped
} 0: No source file nametmp.c
} configure: error: ERROR MACROS NOT FOUND:  please report to developers

That sure looks to me as if awk has dumped core.  It could be that
egrep did instead, but it seems less likely.  Check config.log?
