} Without a suitably recent version of zsh, the answer is probably to
} upgrade.

Isn't this what "setopt localtraps" is for?

    ssh () {
      setopt localtraps
      trap ':' INT
      set_screen_title ${*##-*}
      command ssh "$@"
      set_screen_title "${HOST/.*}"
    }

If your zsh isn't recent enough to have localtraps, see above.
