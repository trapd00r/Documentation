    Hi all :))

    When doing 'make check', the E01options test fails when testing
the option 'BSD_ECHO'. The expected output is:

    histon\nimpintong
    girton
    cottenham
    newnham
    comberton

    but instead it outputs

    histon\nimpintong
    girton
    cottenham
    newnham\ncomberton

    Seems that BSD_ECHO didn't work :??

    In addition to this, the Y01completion test runs forever, with no
output. Is this known or need I to setopt xtrace and try again to see
where it stops?

    Thanks :)
