Hi all.  I'm using zsh 3.0.1, under linux 2.0.18, Redhat i386 4.0.  I can
telnet to my sparc and login just fine, but I am having problems logging
into my linux box from my sparc.  The sparc is running a recent version of
bash.

If I change my shell to bash on my linux box, things are better, but there
is still a problem.  When I telnet, I get the following prompt:
----
Connected to ...
Escape character is '^]'.
Password:
Login incorrect

login:
---

So as you see, it immediately prompts me for a password, before even
asking for a username, then prompts me for a login name, after pressing
return once.

If I keep zsh on my linux box, I get the same 'Password:' prompt, but upon
pressing return, it immediately says "Connection closed by foreign...".

I'm using mingetty as my terminal getty.  Termcap lib 2.0.8, and
/etc/termcap version 9.12.0.

Could this be a zsh problem?

Can someone direct me on what to do to diagnose this problem?

Thanks much,
Dave Wreski
