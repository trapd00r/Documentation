Is it possible to use c-style "static" variables in my functions, or do I
have to stick to global ones? My precmd function doesn't get too happy when
its variables are tampered with, and it's quite slow enough as it is without
sanitytests. Having some variables accessable only from a certain function
(precmd in this case) would help a lot and unclutter the huge list of global
variables a bit, while at it.

If it's possible, how is it done?
