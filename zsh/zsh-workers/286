It seems that ~username expansion is broken under SunOS 4.1.x

No matter where in my userID (or anyone else's) I hit <TAB>, this is what
happens.  (I remember it being OK in v2.2, BTW.)  This happens on systems
with 45 users as often as on a system with 650+ users, with username
caching or not, on sun4c or on sun4m.  Works fine under Solaris 2.4,
though.  I didn't see it in the BUGS file...is this a problem with
SunOS4/NIS or zsh?
