:4. I'm sitting here trying to think of the fourth bug I found.......

:produces
:% $(cat nothing)cat: nothing: No such file or directory

The question here is, is there a case where we need the command's output
(in this case ``cat'') from stderr?
If there is, should some attempt to made to format it, ie. call trashzle()
and put the stderr below and then below that refresh the line?
If there isn't, then we should discard stderr.
