Yep, something like this would be nice.  There's a slight problem in
that commits tend in practice (I find) to be done in bursts, so you
might be sending more than one `do a cvsup -s now' instruction to the
mirrors within a small time span.  However I get the impress that
cvsup is so efficient this would be no great disaster anyway.

P.S. Tanaka, if you decide to do this loginfo trick, could you include
zsh-mirror@thelonious.new.ox.ac.uk on the list of e-mail addresses to
notify?
