Hello,
	I am using zsh 2.6beta13 on sparc-icl-sysv4.2.

	In bash 1.13.5 (at least), the jobs command returns a
meaningful exit status.  This feature has been used in various
bash scripts to determine whether a job is running or not.
	
	This could be useful, I guess.  Could it be incorporated?
	Only a trivial modification is needed.

Regards,
Harmanjit Singh.

P.S. I am new on this list, so please forgive any newbieness.
