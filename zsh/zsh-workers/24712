However, there is a glitch in the quoting code; it's
independent of here-documents but there aren't many places
where we do this, so it hasn't shown up before:

% hello() {
  cat <<HERE
  I will `echo stuff` and then `echo more stuff`
  HERE
}
% functions hello
hello () {
        cat <<< "I will `echo stuff`` and then ``echo more stuff```"
}
