Heyla,
% touch 101 111 121
% ls <10-12>1
ls: <10-12>1: No such file or directory

Now, it's obvious why it's failing, since 101, 111 & 121 don't match the
10 to 12 range.  My opinion is that it probably shouldn't fail in this case,
but maybe a different operator or option/modifier should be used to get it
to match. since there may be cases where someone wants to match on, say,
``<1-50>foo'' and not get, say, ``100foo'' matching.
Opinions?
