	maybe the documentation i have isn't that complete, but all i could find 
in the manpage for zshparam is the fact that the variables like cdpath and path 
exist and are "special" varaibles; there isn't any mention of how they are 
mapped on to their capitalized counterparts.  my next question, then, is if 
these do, in fact, work the way i surmised (that is, they remove redundancies 
and map their colon-delimited versions onto the capitalized equivalent 
variable).  also, what exactly is the format for defining them?  is it just 
paren-enclosed, space-delimited lists?

	the version of typeset on my system doesn't seem to support this option 
(or at least, the man page doesn't mention it).  typeset doesn't return an error 
if i try to use the -U switch, however; could someone summarize the syntax so i 
could see if it is, in fact, implemented?
