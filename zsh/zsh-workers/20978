I think the answer is probably the following.  Certainly propagating
eofsent in quite the way it currently is is wrong, and it doesn't seem
right to have an EOF handled by zle in a recursive edit to mean exit the
main shell.  It *could* mean that, I suppose, and then the fix would be
to propagate the EOF properly, which is quite tricky when nested deep
inside user-defined widgets.  But I think I prefer this.
