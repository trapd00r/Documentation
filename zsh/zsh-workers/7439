:I didn't get a reply to my question about creating a source archive at
:sunsite.auc.dk.  Maybe Geoff would be thrilled to bits about doing this?

I'm currently moving FTP and CVS services onto a faster link (100Mb) but
a slower machine.  I will let everyone know when it's available.  Web
services will most likely stay on the current machine.
