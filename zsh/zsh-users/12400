} But I can't live without zsh anymore.  So I put the following into .bashrc:
} 
}  if [[ "$REALUSER" == "Andy Spiegl" ]]; then
}    which zsh >/dev/null 2>&1 && exec zsh -l
}  fi

The first thing I'd try is changing from

	exec zsh -l

to

	exec zsh -$- "$@"

However, if want you really want is to NOT exec zsh for scp, then it may
be sufficient to change the test to:

	[[ ! -t 0 && "$REALUSER" == "Andy Spiegl" ]]

Alternately, to implement Casper's suggestion:

	[[ "$-" != *i* && "$REALUSER" == "Andy Spiegl" ]]
