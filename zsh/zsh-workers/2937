Running this script

    #!/bin/zsh -f

    print "version $ZSH_VERSION"

    false
    case $? in
	0)  print "case says \$? is 0";;
    esac

    false
    print "\$? was actually $?"

gives me this buggy result

    version 3.0.3-test4
    case says $? is 0
    $? was actually 1

on both freebsd and dgux.
