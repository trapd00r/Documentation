Ah yes!  Believe it or not I had ``tested'' whether 'mesg' by itself would  
work, but I had only tested it when I had messages ON!  So I never noticed  
this.

Thanks for the pointer.  The new function is as follows:

mesg () {

        case $1 in
                n*|off)
                        TALK="<notalk> "
                        /usr/bin/mesg n
                ;;

                '')
                        /usr/bin/mesg
                ;;

                *)
                        TALK=""
                        /usr/bin/mesg $*
                ;;

        esac
}
