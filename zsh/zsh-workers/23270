Subject: PATCH: "strftime -r" messes up with DST on Solaris

This:

  zmodload -i zsh/datetime
  strftime -r "%Y %b %d %H %M %S" "2007 April 12 15 18 00"'

gives the wrong answer on Solaris because strptime() zeroes the
tm_isdst element that we carefully set to -1 to indicate we didn't
know it.  There's no way of telling the resulting zero apart from
a value set explicitly from the input format, so mktime() thinks that
it's not summer time, whereas is is (it's even quite warm out).
Luckily, there's a "make it work" definition you can set.
