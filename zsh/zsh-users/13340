All keybindings are documented in 'man zshzle'.

The 'inputrc' file is used by the readline library, which zsh does not
use. It has no effect on zsh at all.

The terminal software you are using may have an effect on the
character sequences, that are sent by "special-keys" like PageUp etc.

For some techniques on how to tackle such cases, see:
