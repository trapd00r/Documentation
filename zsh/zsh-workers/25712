I'm guessing that you've got this far by using _arguments and passing it
something like the following:
  '-e[additional password checks]:check:(n s ns)' \

To add descriptions, you would use something like the following:
  '-e[additional password checks]:check:((n\:No\ password s\:Username\ =\ Password ns\:No\ Password\ \&\ Username\ =\ Password))'

I'm not familiar with the medusa software so can't say for sure if this
really is the right answer. You might actually want to use _values for
the list of checks.
