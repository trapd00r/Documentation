} Using the glob qualifier mh+n selects files modified more than
} n+1 hours instead of more than n hours ago.

} If this is a feature to make a partition with mh-n, mhn and mh+n,
} then the wording in the manual should be changed

Unless I'm mistaken, this is all for compatibility with the way that
"find" defines +n, -n and n.  If you ask me, it's always silly to
define any meaning for "exactly <number> <timeunits> ago"; it always
means "during the <timeunit> that began <number> <timeunits> before
the current <timeunit> began" (but then for any significantly large
unit you can get into arguments about what "began" means).  But zsh
did not invent the nomenclature.
