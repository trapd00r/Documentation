I'm just trying to tidy up the zshcomptl manual page a bit, since it's
changed quite a lot (now I'll have to try and work the latest patch
in).  The difficult bit is -M.  In particular I don't understand what
is going on the partial completion example at all, nor can I get it to
work.  The incantation given is:

compctl -M 'r:|[.,_-]=* r:|=*'

First, according to the description above this, it means that the
`line pattern' is blank and the anchor is one of the set in [...].  Is
that right?  Wouldn't I need to ignore what's on the left?  How does
that help me complete, say comp.sources.u<TAB> as a partial word?  I
tried something like

% compctl -M 'r:[.,_-]|=* r:|=*' -k '(comp sources unix)' foo
% foo c.s.u<TAB>

but nothing happened.  I can get the c on its own to work, as usual,
but nothing else.
