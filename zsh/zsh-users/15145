I'm not very actively following Git's development (always running
latest release though), but I don't think that's the case for the
"normal" user. I consider myself an intermediate/advanced git
user and use _git from the current zsh CVS checkout and I've
never felt _git was missing something important (sometimes file
completion could be even smarter - and maybe faster, but it's
already very good). Sometimes one option or another is missing,
but I don't think that's a big problem as I can just add it (or
ignore it, as I don't need all of git's options anyway).

Thanks by the way for the great work the developers of _git have
done.

I don't see the difference between maintaining the _git file in
zsh's CVS or in git's git repository regarding the speed of
development of _git.

If an active git developer (or anybody else) wants to update it
in zsh's CVS he only needs to send the patches here and they are
applied quickly.

The only difference is, as others have already mentioned, that
maintaining a file in two places is a very bad thing. And as user
I have to look in many different places (and I even have to know
that the completion exists) to get my completion functions.
That's not a very good idea.

IMHO moving _git to git's repository only increase the work in
maintaining it, sometimes which could be spend much better in
improving it.
