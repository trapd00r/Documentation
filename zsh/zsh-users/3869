From: Peter Stephenson <pws@csr.com>

I've just uploaded zsh-4.0.1-pre-4 to ftp.zsh.org in the directory
pub/development with a .bz2 version which somebody asked for (actually the
.gz version hasn't arrived yet but I presume it will).  It will then spread
to the various mirrors.

This may be your last chance to try things out before zsh-4.0.1.  There
have been a lot of changes recently to try to get round configuration
problems with termcap and curses.  It would be helpful if you could let
zsh-workers@sunsite.dk know if this still isn't working on your machine ---
or any other failure to compile or run.
