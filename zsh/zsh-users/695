     Hi zsh-users!
     
     i'm very new to zsh. can anyone send me sample .zsh* files? and 
     functions? it would be a great help for me to get a start on zsh.
     
     also the append history does not seem to work. i did a 
     setopt appendhistory 
     but it doesn't help. all my zsh sessions start with null history. 
     where is the history file anyway? dont we have a common file as in ksh 
     or bash?
     
     TIA,
     Pradeep
