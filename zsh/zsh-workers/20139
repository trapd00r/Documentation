So this happens with both 4.2.0 and the latest, and therefore isn't
(directly) related to the mmap reorganisation of heap allocation?

Is it possible a memory allocator is returning 0?  It could be another
case where the shell is trying to allocate way too much memory, not
getting it, and not handling the failure gracefully.
