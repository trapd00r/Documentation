Question 1
----------

How do I post to zsh-users as I am only subscribed to this list and thus
need to confirm my emails to zsh-users?  Is the only way to work with it
to confirm?  Since the lists are nested, subscribing to both is not very
good.

Question 2
----------

This should have gone to zsh-users but still.  Is there any way to
disable equals completion (the -equals- context)?  Since I have noequals
set it's rather silly to have the completion system trying to expand it.
I tried figuring out a way to check for '-o equals' somewhere but didn't
come up with anything decent.
