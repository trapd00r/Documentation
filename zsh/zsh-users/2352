} for some reason $1 does not get set properly under 3.0.5 extended so I
} manually parse it out from $*, dunno about newer versions.

I'm not sure why you say $1 does not get set properly.  $1 gets set to
the entire command line, which is exactly how it's documented:

`preexec'
     Executed just after a command has been read and is about to be
     executed.  If the history mechanism is active, the string to be
     executed is passed as an argument.             ^^^^!!!!!!^^^^^^
     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^!!^^^^^^^^^

Is that in fact what you see, or is there a bug that I can't reproduce?
