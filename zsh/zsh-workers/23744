Subject: Unexpected side effect of 'setopt correct'
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Content-Disposition: inline

I just noticed this effect of 'setopt correct'.. Is this intentional behavior?

~> zsh -f
mastermind% setopt correct
mastermind% pid() {
zsh: correct 'pid' to 'pic' [nyae]? %


mastermind% function pid() {
function>
mastermind%

Is it intentional that it attempts to correct on a function
definition?  Is it intentional that it only attempts to correct one of
the two types of function definition?  Something about this behavior
caught me off guard.  :)
