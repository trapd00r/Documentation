Hi,

I have some problems when I try to match all files which include no
dot in their filename...

I just want zsh to do this:  Move all files which have no extension to
<former filename>.html.

First I thought of this: **/*~*.* - but that doesn't work since it
includes sub-directories which I dont want to get matched. So I tried
**/*(.)~*.* to just match files - but zsh says that doesn't work.

Anny suggestions?  TIA!

Julius
