It would probably be better to use this syntax though even if we have to
restrict the separator to space and colon for the time being until the
parameter code is more flexible.

-d would probably be a better choice than -S though (consistent with
read and externals like cut).

As for the ct suggestion, I'm not sure which I'm less likely to need: a
separator other than space and colon or field widths on a tied array. I
think I may have wanted a semi-colon once on Cygwin but we do risk
breaking existing scripts.
