Subject: Disabling unwanted completion functions

I found nothing in the manual that described how to disable a
particular completion function, but after a little experimentation,
I came up with a solution.  As an example, this is how I would
disable completion for tar:

  unset "_comps[tar]"

Is this the recommended way to do it in zsh 4.0.6?
