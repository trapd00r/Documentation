Seems, he does not like me.

Yes, I have that program. But I am afraid it will not help solving my  
problem, since you would only see the result of the problem.
Anyway, it is very short so I am posting it:

[hanno: /home/hanno]>cat typescript
Script started on Sat Mar 10 16:35:25 2007
[hanno: /home/hanno]>cd /us
[hanno: /home/hanno]>exit

Script done on Sat Mar 10 16:35:42 2007

That's it ! :)
Maybe I describe it one more time:
I typed: "cd /usr/src <tab><tab>", that is "cs /usr/src" and then the  
tab key two times.
After that I could see multiple choices: the directories in /usr/src  
(of course). See Above:

[hanno: /usr/src]>cd /uscd /usr/src/
directory
bin/        crypto/     games/      include/    lib/         
release/    sbin/       share/      tools/      usr.sbin/
contrib/    etc/        gnu/        kerberos5/  libexec/     
rescue/     secure/     sys/        usr.bin/

Here you can see that some part of my typing was deleted by the  
completition , some part is still there.
When I try to delete everything I typed by pressing <backspace> it  
looks like this:


[hanno: /usr/src]>cd /us
directory
bin/        crypto/     games/      include/    lib/         
release/    sbin/       share/      tools/      usr.sbin/
contrib/    etc/        gnu/        kerberos5/  libexec/     
rescue/     secure/     sys/        usr.bin/

I cannot delete the "cd /us"
Strange hmm?

Thank you again for helping.
Without it,I would take another shell, since I couldn't solve the  
problem on my own.
