zshaddhistory/zshaddhistory_functions: annoyingly, you can't use them for
quite this purpose.  You can veto adding history entries at the point
they're added, but that's before they're executed, so you don't have the
status.

It might be possible to force it to overwrite it, but I don't think that's
a simple change.
