In fact it affects every places where patterns can be used except explicit
glob patterns on the command line and case patterns.  This means -m builtin
options, completion glob patterns, ${...%...} substitutions, $foo[(r)...]
indexing etc.

It does not affect explicit glob patterns because in that case these
patterns result in syntax error in sh.  Also it would make the lexer a bit
more complicated since more special test sould be added and case patterns
should be treated specially.
