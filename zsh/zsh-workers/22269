One other minor fix that I noticed in my patched code affects a request
for no-splitting when SH_WORD_SPLIT is enabled:

  setopt shwordsplit
  foo='1 2'
  print -l ${==foo+$foo}

That used to split the variable $foo if it was not quoted (an
interesting case where quotes made a difference in the old code).

I've checked in my changes, including a couple new sentences in the
zshexpn man page.

If we decide that the change in splitting is undesirable after all, the
following one-line change will put things back to the way they were
before (except that the bug above will still be fixed):

 	    }

Of course, we'd also need to change some of the D04 tests and the docs.
