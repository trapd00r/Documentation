} Why you don't call _apt-get directly?

It's not autoloaded.  It only gets defined the first time _apt is called.

} Yes, you are right. The completion of long and short options (--help

I'm no further help there, I'm afraid -- I don't use apt or Debian, so
once completion reaches the point of calling the programs to ask what the
options are, everything breaks for me.
