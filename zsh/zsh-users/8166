    Hi Nick :)

    That doesn't happen in my system, I think that's due the keymap
settings (I refer to the Linux keymap, not the zsh one).

    Mmm... Have you tested that the ESC-. combo works? Could you post
the output of 'bindkey'? I think that it may have to do with the
map... I've never use vi keymap under zsh, and maybe you should set
the binding in the 'vicmd' map, and not in 'viins' map (or maybe in
both of them!).

    That's very weird :?

    OK.

    This feature in particular should work, it's no more than a key
combo (and works here with 4.0.9). Let's discover the problem :)

    Have fun :)
