Since this is a major release number, thought folks might find this
interesting, even though this is off topic.

There's a Slashdot posting:
http://linux.slashdot.org/linux/04/07/29/139218.shtml?tid=162&tid=117&tid=190&tid=130&tid=106

Chet Ramey's Usenet posting:
http://groups.google.com/groups?dq=&start=25&hl=en&lr=lang_da%7Clang_en%7Clang_no%7Clang_pl%7Clang_sv&ie=UTF-8&group=comp.unix.shell&c2coff=1&selm=ce69oa%24sev%241%40eeyore.INS.cwru.edu

Major new features from that posting:
o Features to support the bash debugger have been implemented, and there
  is a new `extdebug' option to turn the non-default options on

o HISTCONTROL is now a colon-separated list of options and has been
  extended with a new `erasedups' option that will result in only one
  copy of a command being kept in the history list

o Brace expansion has been extended with a new {x..y} form, producing
  sequences of digits or characters

o Timestamps are now kept with history entries, with an option to save
  and restore them from the history file; there is a new HISTTIMEFORMAT
  variable describing how to display the timestamps when listing history
  entries

o The `[[' command can now perform extended regular expression (egrep-like)
  matching, with matched subexpressions placed in the BASH_REMATCH array
  variable

o A new `pipefail' option causes a pipeline to return a failure status if
  any command in it fails

o The `jobs', `kill', and `wait' builtins now accept job control notation
  in their arguments even if job control is not enabled
