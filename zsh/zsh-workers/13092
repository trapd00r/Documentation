Subject: Writing multi-part command completion functions
To: zsh-workers <zsh-workers@sunsite.auc.dk>
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Is there a recommended way to deal with multi-part commands.  For
example, many of  the source control systems cvs, rcs, sccs, and prcs
all have a main command, with the first argument typically being a
sub-command.  Many times the sub-command can be abbreviated.

There are already some completion functions that handle commands like
this (e.g. _cvs).  Is there a preferred way to do this? Is there one
that provides a better example of how to structure such a completion
function(s)?  Would it make sense to add support to make it easier to write
such a function?

Thanks
-FR.
