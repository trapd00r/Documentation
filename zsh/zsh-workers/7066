From: Peter Stephenson <pws@ibmth.df.unipi.it>

There's a stupid bug with function installation.

I had to apply bits of the last mod_complist.yo patch by hand, too.

I'm just preparing a 3.1.6-test-1 release.  I want to upload it to the
archive and stick it in a subdirectory testing.  How do I do that?
