My guess is that this is something to do with the zsh/pty module which is
used to test completion since it's tied to interactive behaviour.  `pty'
isn't a part of the core shell, and it's quite hairy to get it to work
on all flavours of UNIX, so I would have said it's OK to ignore the
failure.  

Obviously it would also be nice to work out what's going wrong.
However, I don't think any of us in these parts use HPUX at the moment.
