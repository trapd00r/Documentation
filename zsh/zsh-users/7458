I have the following script, with appended output.  There are 3 cases teste=
d,=20
comparing a reference value for parameter "bref" with 3 values of parameter=
=20
"b".  The utility od is used to verify the values of the "bref" and "b"=20
parameters. =20

My question is:  why are the values of "b" not equal to "bref" in cases 1 a=
nd=20
2?  If the issue is parameter type, is there any way to display the paramet=
er=20
type for "b"?

Thank you.
