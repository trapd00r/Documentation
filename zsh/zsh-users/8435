Subject: can't complete .. paths with 4.2.3

With zsh 4.2.3, on AIX, HP-UX and Solaris, if I use the completion
system I can't complete a path that starts with '..' .  It works fine
on Cygwin.

My .compinstall is nothing special.  I stripped out everything but
'autoload -U compinit' and 'compinit -u' and the .. completion still
didn't work.

Has anyone else seen this?  It was working fine for me in 4.2.2.
