       %D{string}
              string is formatted using the strftime function.  See
strftime(3) for more
              details.  Three additional codes are available:  %f
prints the day of  the
              month,  like  %e  but  without  any preceding space if
the day is a single
              digit, and %K/%L correspond to %k/%l for the hour of the
day  (24/12  hour
              clock) in the same way.

This is what happens when I try it:
% strftime %T $EPOCHSECONDS
00:28:42
% print -P %D{%T}
07-12-16 07-12-16T
% print -P %D{12345}
07-12-161 07-12-162 07-12-163 07-12-164 07-12-165

It seems to just print the date #string times followed by each character?
It works as prescribed on my friend's computer that has 4.3.4 and
another one with 4.2.5.
