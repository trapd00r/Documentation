Subject: Completion troubles
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

I've had a couple of problems with the latest zsh:

nedit -lm <tab>
Gives me a message about _all_labels:39: command not found: -M
I can't see where this might be a problem anywhere in _nedit. I can
reproduce it from a basic zsh -f based setup (although it complains
about -J instead). The sed command to get the list of languages does
little more than output a list of words (some of which contain spaces)
but I can provide an sample .nedit file if you have trouble reproducing
it.

The other thing is the _expand completer now seems to be expanding
everything after a tilde which is annoying. I'm sure that it used to
work (not expanding anything after tilde), then it started completing
named directories and home directories. Now it also expands ~+ so I
can't use it and get the very useful list of directories in the stack to
complete from. I think _expand really needs a rethink because it is more
trouble than it is worth at the moment. For example, if you do:
cd ${foo<tab>
you get a message about a closing brace being expected rather than
completing the variable names. _expand should either do something useful
or pass on to the next completer.
