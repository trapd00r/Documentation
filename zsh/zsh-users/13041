I meant I supect the code that sometimes fixes things up may well not be
kicking in in this case, but I don't understand it.  Cygwin needs to
do strange things and it's not clear to me why binary mode would make a
pipe harder to seek on than text mode; I would expect the opposite.

I don't even know how Cygwin expects you to set the mode on a pipe;
possibly with fcntl().
