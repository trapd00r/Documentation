I completely agree...

The options for zsh when called as sh, should not depend on
your current configuration.  It is especially bad for us sysadmins
who work on heterogenous environments.... I don't want zsh working
one way on one machine, and another way on another machine.

One of the reasons people install third party shells is to get
consistency across their various platforms.
