"depreciate" and "deprecate" are both valid English words.  They have
completely different meanings, and the appropriate one here is
"deprecate".

I've not done a typeset -M patch yet.  I was planning to wait until the
ones I've sent so far have got in.  I have a list of builtins waiting
to have this option added, but while the patches aren't being used
there's not much point working on it.

Btw, the reason I haven't sent any patches in the last couple of weeks
is that my computer is not in a very usable state right now.  The
graphics card is sulking, and the serial card is only sending data in
one direction (out).  This means that I can do the minimal admin tasks
needed to configure the software side of the serial I/O, but it's not
very conducive to editing source.  :-)  I should be back in action
within a week.
