Don't. Every question (if it can be answered ;-) helps you and us (to
learn where people have problems).

Look at the contents of the Completion directory. We already have
dedicated sub-directories for some systems (AIX, Bsd, Debian, Linux).
And there'll be a big overhaul of the directory structure before the
release of 4.0 so that it should be easier for users to select those
directories they need/want. Hopefully.
