I'm not subscribed to the list and so have to start a new mail thread rathe=
r than following up with the one that I started.  Apologies for the inconve=
nience.

Thank you for the help you've provided.  I've narrowed down the scope of th=
e problem, and it's likely nothing to do with ZSH.

Two things I tried in response to your suggestions were:
- Removing the use of "Phil!'s ZSH Prompt" because of its precmd function
- Rebuilding ZSH to use statically linked libraries.
But the problem persisted.

One curious thing was that the process that was producing the output had al=
ways died even while the looping was going on.  Using strace, the ZSH was b=
locked on a read, waiting for the next command, and for that reason one can=
't blame ZSH for the scrolling output.

What I found was this:  If I initiated the rlogin/ssh command (it doesn't m=
atter which) to the remote machine from an Expect script as I was doing, th=
en I could experience the problem when using the ZSH login shell on the rem=
ote machine.

On the other hand, running rlogin/ssh from the command line or from a shell=
 script resulted in the problem going away.

So, it appears that the problem is really with Expect and not with ZSH.

Thanks again.

Jeff
