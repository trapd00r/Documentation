It works in zsh (as (...) are the same as ksh's @(...)), but
wouldn't in ksh. I'd expect you to get an error in ksh.

When zsh is called as "ksh", the kshglob option is activated.

As I said:

The zsh equivalent of @(...) is (...), the equivalent of *(x) is
x# (with extendedglob).

~$ setopt nokshglob extendedglob; echo ${userId##[pPRrTt]([0-9]|[a-z])[0-9]#}
btu btu btu eb41 bt2 jro dri

You need the extendedglob.

Note that bash's extglob is actually a subset of ksh's extended
globbing operators. zsh's kshglob also is a subset, it doesn't
include the latest ones from latest versions of ksh93. zsh's
extendedglob has a few operators which ksh93 doesn't have such
as <x-y> for matching numbers.
