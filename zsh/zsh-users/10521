Admins recently made a change to a shell account of mine, after which
I now no longer get my zsh prompt at login, I get a generic tcsh prompt.

I then have to type 'zsh' to get my zsh environment as I have it set up.
Also when I log out of zsh with 'bye', I get put back into the generic
tcsh prompt and then have to type 'exit' to log off:

nautilus%
nautilus%
nautilus% zsh

Connection to shell.shore.net closed.


(No changes were made to my own .zprofile, .zshenv or .zshrc.)

I mentioned this to the admins but they're clueless and, though a few
shell-account users remain on this ISP (Primushost, formerly shore.net),
shell accounts are no longer supported.  Zsh is version 3.1.6.  I need
this account for now and can't close it for awhile.

What do I need to do to be able to log directly into and directly out
of zsh?
