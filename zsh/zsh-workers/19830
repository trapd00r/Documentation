Also, this may provide a useful complement to Sourceforge viewcvs:

http://arch.debian.org/cgi-bin/viewarch.cgi/schizo@debian.org--2004-zsh-upstream-cvs-head/zsh--cvshead--1.0

for patch-8 and later, you'll see the ChangeLog hunk followed by links
to each modified file (assuming that everything is working properly).
