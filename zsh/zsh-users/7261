Looks interesting. But I cannot test your solution as thoroughly as it
deserves because it doesn't recognize the Prompt sequences in my
rprompt ($cyan, $reset_color[1]).

Could you modify your "zle-line-init/POSTDISPLAY" solution so the
colours in my prompt are shown?


Thanks, Thorsten

 [~/.zshrc]
 autoload -U colors; colors
 cyan=$fg_no_bold[cyan]
 RPROMPT='%{$cyan%}%~%{$reset_color%} %h:%i'
