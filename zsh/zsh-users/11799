I do not want to start any flamewar and since I switched (most of) my
lists to GMail, I benefit from its strange auto-reply-to-list magic anyway,
but for completeness, let everyone read both the anti [1] and the pro [2]
stance on mungling. And yes, I mungle the lists I admin. And no, I will
not participate in any ensuing discussion. People's minds tend to be
made up on this issue already, anyway :)
