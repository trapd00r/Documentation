hi list,

one thing that i seem to not get:
how can i do something like the following:

/home/matthias% echo "
this
is
just
a 
test  << at this point i want to go back and change
this with that. but with k or cursor-back i get history,
not line, so then i hit contrl-c and everything is fine,
when i go back a line now. 
i just thought , there might be a better way
and i am nearly sure, i overlooked something,
right?

Matthias
