I didn't know that before yesterday but it was a bad idea in fact :
openssl base64 doesn't handle utf8 encoded content. So i found recode
command. 

finaly :

alias b64dec='recode b64..data'
alias b64enc='recode data..b64'

benches are welcome ;)

Not good but not horrible.
Consistently slower than everything else but only microscopically.
Even though it's the slowest of all, you still have to call it "fast".
