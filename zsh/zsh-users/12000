} OK, here's two:

These are fine prompts, but they aren't quite themes, yet.

The prompt_ZZZ_setup file for any theme ZZZ ought to define at least
two functions:

prompt_ZZZ_help
prompt_ZZZ_setup

See Functions/Prompts/prompt_oliver_setup for a simple example.  One
other function may be defined as well:

prompt_ZZZ_preview

See Functions/Prompts/prompt_elite_setup for a short example of that.

Any other prompt_*_function or precmd/preexec are just helpers; the
theme system only uses the above three.

I know, some of the existing themes don't define help or preview, but
that doesn't mean they shouldn't.
