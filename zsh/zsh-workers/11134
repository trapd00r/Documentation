Remind me why we can't implement :q by tokenizing rather than by actually
inserting quotes into the string?

Here's tcsh:

[schaefer@candle]$ echo '"'
"
[schaefer@candle]$ echo "!!:q"
echo "echo '"'"
echo '"'
[schaefer@candle]$

Now here's zsh:

zagzig% echo '"'
"
zagzig% echo "!!:q"
dquote> <send-break>
echo "'echo' ''\''"'\'''"
zagzig% 

(Never mind why tcsh thinks hostname is candle but zsh thinks it's zagzig.)
