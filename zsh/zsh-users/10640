I'm stuck with my first completion

I want to limit a completion style for commands using the _fmri
matcher. But when I use following settings, all commands will use the
_fmri matcher...

What's wrong? Comlpetion does work correctly, when not defining these
zstyles.

zstyle ':completion:*' completer _fmri
zstyle ':completion:*:*:*:*:fmri' matcher-list 'm:{a-z}={A-Z}
m:{a-zA-Z}={A-Za-z} r:|[._-]=** r:|=** l:|=*' 'm:{a-z}={A-Z}'
zstyle ':completion:*:fmri:*' menu select 20
