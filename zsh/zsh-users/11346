Hi,

 I _always_ fail with constructions like

 cat file.txt | while read file
 do
     <cmd> "${file}"
 done

 when file.txt containing one file per line and
 a filename looks like:

    This is an odd filename.txt
 
 . Is there one for all cure for such a constellation?
 Too much space gives me headaches ! ;)

 Thank you very much for any help in advance! :)

 Keep zshing!
  mcc
