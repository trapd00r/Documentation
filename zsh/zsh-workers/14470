Subject: zftp annoyance
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

I'm using zftp to transfer things back and forth from a server.
Unfortunately, every time the connection times out and zftp reconnects
the transfer type is reverting to ASCII. Surely it ought to be restoring
the transfer type when it reconnects?

This may just be something related to the particular ftp server - I
normally use ncftp because I would normally get one file and quit so I'm
not hugely familiar with zftp. Is it possible to make binary the default
transfer type for zftp?

Oliver
