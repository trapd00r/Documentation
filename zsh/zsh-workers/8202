Deliberate in the sense that noone (at least not me) took the time to
write that. *But* I already wished we had it, too. So, if you offer to 
write them: yes, please ;-)

I'd vote for a separate section because the function in `Utility
Functions' don't generate the matches themselves, they are told what
should be added, whereas functions like `_users' decide that for
themselves.

(This may also be a bit of a banana problem: `_x_colors' and friends?)

At least I am only still dreaming of a generic package system (to
replace the ad hoc compinit and friends) and of a cleanup for the
keymap stuff.

Bye
