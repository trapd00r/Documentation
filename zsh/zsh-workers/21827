    Hi Peter :)

    After the patch, long file names causes screen mess and crashes,
but not infinite loops. Long prompts doesn't seem to be affected,
I've been able to reproduce the problem with and without a very long
PS1. The options doesn't seem to be the culprit, because I've tested
with "zsh -f" and *without* /etc/zshenv.

    I first hit the bug in my 4.2.5, so...
