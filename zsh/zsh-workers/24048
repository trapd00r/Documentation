Subject: PATCH: fix home directory expansion with NIS
Date: Thu, 01 Nov 2007 10:40:49 +0000
Message-ID: <21799.1193913649@thecus>

This has been irritating me for a while: some ~username expansions were
coming out as garbled strings from the middle of the password file.

The problem, which is specific to NIS on Solaris, occurs because our
yp_all callback was assuming that the key and val parameters are null
terminated. The fix below makes use of the vallen parameter to find the
end of the string.
