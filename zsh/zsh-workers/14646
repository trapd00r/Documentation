Subject: PATCH: final(?) documentation changes
Date: Fri, 01 Jun 2001 14:46:00 +0100
From: Peter Stephenson <pws@csr.com>

At Oliver's suggestion, here are some final tweaks for the documentation.
The FEATURES file was always a bit higgledy piggledy and I haven't done
more than throw in some entries from the announcement for 4.0.1 and
slightly reorder it.

When this goes in, I'll rename the ChangeLog and ChangeLog-Release to
ChangeLog-3.1 (which Bart says is the correct name).
