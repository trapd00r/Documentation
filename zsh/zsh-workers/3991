I think it's unpleasant that "zsh -i" goes out of its way to find and read
from /dev/tty.  At the very least, "zsh -si" should use the standard input
as it was told, and not go reopening the terminal.

This actually appears to be zle's fault, because if I explicitly shut off
zle with "zsh +Z -i" then I can shovel standard input at it all I like.  I
would think, though, that zle should depend on the input being a tty, and
not the other way around.
