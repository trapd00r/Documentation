Regarding multibyte character support, here is a feature suggestion:            
Say we have two-byte characters (commonly used in Chinese/Japanese/             
Korean) AA, BB, XX, and YY                                                      
                                                                                
The correct behavior when I have the following text:                            
                                                                                
AABBXXYY<cursor>                                                                
and I push "backspace" once                                                     
The result would be:                                                            
AABBXX                                                                          
                                                                                
But zsh does this:                                                             
AABBXXY                                                                         
                                                                                
And we have to push the delete button again, same incorrect behavior            
happens with arrow keys, ^W and etc.                                            
                                                                                
Basically, zsh needs to be taught about multibyte characters.                  
Would you mind modifying zsh behavior to respect an environmental              
shell variable that toggles this as well as the functionality?                  
                                                                                
Merry Christmas and thanks,
