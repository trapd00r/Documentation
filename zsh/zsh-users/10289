Hi,
I did a eye-candy (also eye-cancer) prompt.
Works fine.
But when I use the autocorrection, my command I already typed overwrites some 
characters of the prompt?
Why and what to do?
The prompt is:
PS1=$'%{\e[1;36m\e(0lq\e(B%}[%(!.%{\e[0;31m%}.%{\e[1;32m%})%n%{\e[1;33m%}@%m:
%{\e[1;32m%4(C<.../%3c<%d)%{\e[1;36m%}]%{\e(0qqqqqq\e(B%}[%{\e[1;33m%}%D{%d.
%m.%Y %H:%M}%{\e[1;36m%}]%{\e(0qqqqqq\e(B%}
[%{\e[1;31m%}%?%{\e[1;36m%}]\n%{\e(0mq\e(B%}
[%{\e[1;33m%}%h%{\e[1;36m%}]%{\e(0q\e(B%}%(#.%{\e[0;31m%}.
%{\e[1;36m%})>%{\e[m%} '

the last "->" is overwritten (at least on my pc).
