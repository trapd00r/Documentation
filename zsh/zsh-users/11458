That might be your user shell, but that doesn't mean /bin/sh is zsh.
Unfortunately, when I check, something is setting SHELL to the shell
from the user database.  Bah!

Change that to #!/bin/zsh

After that, you'll have zsh behaviour.  Which, by default, does *NOT*
split on whitespace the way that every other shell does.  Making zsh
especially nice on MacOS.
