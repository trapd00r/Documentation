I'm not able to get this with dwm (which wasn't hard to install as it
took an unmeasurably small time to compile) in tiling mode, urxvt, and
your .zshrc, so it will certainly need some work.  I can send a guess at
where the fprintf's might reveal something, if you like.  You might want
to try the imminent 4.3.5, though I don't have any good reason to
suppose that helps.

..as it presumably is on my Fedora 7 x86_64 T5500 system.
