Subject: zsh on NT over samba?

I'm trying to build applications on NT 4.0 (which I hate) and NT 4.0
terminal server (which is even worse) from a samba mounted device. Using
samba because NT doesn't handle case-sensitivity and corrupts some binaries
when checked out locally over cvs pserver. my
problem is that while zsh works fine locally on NT, when I attempt to
execute a script in the samba directory, I get

"zsh: exec format error:" 

I'm probably just being obtuse about this, but I'd really appreciate any
insight.

Thanks
