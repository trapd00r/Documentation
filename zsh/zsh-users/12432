} This is very nice, but the line above gives me:
} 
} sticky-notes:fc:49: not interactive shell

Sorry; the #!/bin/zsh line was mostly just pro-forma, the script is
really intended to be an autoloaded function:

	autoload -U sticky-note

However, I believe you can fix the script by changing the #! line to

	#!/bin/zsh -fi

I'll commit that change to CVS.
