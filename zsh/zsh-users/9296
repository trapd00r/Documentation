Hi Michael, =


 YES, YES, YEEEEEES!!!
 I *want* arrays -- right *N*O*W* ! At once ! =


 Where can I get them and what do they cost ? =


 ....and do they keep care of the environment?

 :)

 Ok...more seriously...
 I maked an array from my variable and TADA! it works! Great hint!
 Thanks a lot, Micheal!

 Have a nice weekend!
