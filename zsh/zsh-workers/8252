Bart,

Thanks for looking into this. I got 3.1.6 to work. Here are a few more
pieces of data/questions. I will look into a new nawk. I have no idea where
I got the one I have now. It has been a long time.

I don't know what could be the problem here. I have not looked into this.
Since I got it to work, I'll leave it alone.

I made the changes to the lines you indicated to config.sub and config seems
to work. Will this get updated in the next version of zsh?

Since the other change fixed config I'll leave this alone.

I replaced \t with tabs and it compiled. I do not remember where I got the
nawk I have. nawk apparently does not come with HPUX.

The last errors I got were these, but since I think it is just the
documentation, I don't care:

/home/julio/Shar/zsh/zsh-3.1.6/Src/Builtins
/home/julio/Shar/zsh/zsh-3.1.6/Src/Modules
/home/julio/Shar/zsh/zsh-3.1.6/Src/Zle
/home/julio/Shar/zsh/zsh-3.1.6/Doc
        makeinfo ./zsh.texi; exit 0
sh: makeinfo:  not found.

Thanks!
