Yes.  I recall that the feeling at the time was that people didn't want
to have a terminfo library linked into the main binary and all the modules
just for the sake of a terminfo module, and to avoid potential conflicts
in termcap handling.  That's why tigetstr isn't sought.  Since -ltermcap
here is really ncurses, that doesn't bother me.

I have no ideas on how to handle it without individual library linking.
