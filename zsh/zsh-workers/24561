} What if you use it more than once, as in %{...%7G...%3G%} ?

Ooh, and what about negative numbers?  Can one say %-4G to mean that
the sequence actually moved the cursor to the LEFT four positions?
*That* could be really useful.

Another idea:  How about sequences that actually move the cursor?
%H and %V for horizontal/vertical?

%4H -> move cursor four spaces to the right
%5V -> move cursor five lines down
%{%-6H%} -> move cursor six spaces to the left, but pretend you didn't

If %} also remembered the cursor position, then you could also have:

%P -> "pop" cursor back to where it was at the end of the last %{...%}

This may be getting a little bit too far out there.
