I have some supposedly free time.  (Not nearly as much as I had when I
was a student, and I'm only just getting used to the idea that a mere
couple of hours is worth counting as `free', but on the whole employment
has its advantages.)

As there's obviously the need, I'll go through the various patches
carefully over the next few days.  I currently have records of, and will
therefore consider, patches

 2999 3004 3050 3052 3196 3239 3240 3241 3242 3243 3244 3246 3247 3249 3250

 3558 3565 3581 3582 3586 3590 3621 3625 3626 3636 3649 u1068

If anyone thinks I've missed any important patches (my archive is
definitely incomplete), please send me (not the list) a copy of the
relevant article.

Btw, what software generates the ChangeLog files?
