I cannot reproduce this.  ^C should work.  What OS, compiler do you use?
Could you reproduce it with sleep instead of xvi and starting zsh with the
-f switch?

When you send a bugreport, it is always a good idea to mention the OS and
the compiler you use, unless you are absolutely sure that the problem is
general.
