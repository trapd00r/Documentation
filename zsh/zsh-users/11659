I don't think there is and it's true that's a missing one, I'd
say.

Recent ksh93s have {n,p}(expr).

In zsh, you can do something like:

${(l:20::?:)~:-} for .{20}

and

${(l:20::?:)~:-}${(l:40::(?|))~:-}

for .{20,30}

but that's a bit convoluted.

See also ${${(r:30:):-${(l:20::.:):-}}:gs: :(?|)::gs/./?}
