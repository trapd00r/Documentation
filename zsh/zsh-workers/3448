My understanding was that the first loop would find the parent if it was
in the same filesystem as the child; the second would find the place the
child was mounted, in the only other case.

The problem is that it was assumed that a filesystem can only be mounted
one place, and that the device number identifies filesystems.

In this situation, there's /home on filesystem one, /home/a and /home/b
are both automounted directories from filesystem 2.

for a and b, de->d_ino is the inode of the mountpoint directory in /home,
in filesystem 1; sbuf.st_ino is the inode of the mounted directory, in
filesystem 2.

These do the same thing; the only important difference is that the second
lstat()s and compares that info instead of the directory info.

These could be combined into one loop, but you don't really want to stat
unless you have to.
