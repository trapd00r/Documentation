This is good enough for me to see that somewhere the completion system
is messing up the use of metafied characters: with debugging turned on,
there's an error message from "ztrsub" because there's a Meta at the end
of the variable.

Somewhere in the undocmented morass it generates a "compprefix" without
checking properly if the string contains Meta characters and truncates
it incorrectly.  There are lots of ways of checking compprefix.  Someone
is going to have to trace which it is.  We had something similar before
and it took a lot of tracking down.

This is even before we've thought about handling multibyte characters.
