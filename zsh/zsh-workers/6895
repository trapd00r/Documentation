If I remember correctly, when 3.0.0 came to life it was settled on a "Linux
versioning": x.y.z is a development release for odd y, and stable for even y,
with z being bug fix release. And major number (x) is incremented at your
discretion :-)

The vital point is, that 3.1.6 is just a bug fix in this scheme ... and more
than a year for a bug fix is certainly too much :-)

Related theme: what about public CVS for Zsh? In this case it won't suffer as
much from maintainer change and there will be no need for pws-NN releases any
more (as much as I like them :-) Is it possible to host Zsh source tree on
sunsite.auc.dk?
