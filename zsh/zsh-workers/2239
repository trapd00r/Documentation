I dont know how the configure guy builds builtin.c but although it works
fine under HPUX 9.0 under 10.0 it gives:

cpp: "builtin.c", line 3666 there are some unknown limits.  Fix
me!

This is solved by the following patch to builtin.c which I assume
must somehow magically be generated for HPUX 10 but not 9.0.

The fix (however it is to get in?) is:

*** builtin.c.hp9       Tue Oct 15 22:14:50 1996
--- builtin.c   Tue Oct 15 22:15:08 1996
***************
*** 3662,3670 ****
  #  define NEXT_RLIM (RLIMIT_NOFILE + 1)
      "descriptors",
  # endif /* RLIMIT_NOFILE */
- # if NEXT_RLIM != RLIM_NLIMITS
-    #error there are some unknown limits.  Fix me!
- # endif
  # if defined RLIMIT_TCACHE && RLIMIT_TCACHE == NEXT_RLIM
  #  undef NEXT_RLIM
  #  define NEXT_RLIM (RLIMIT_TCACHE + 1)
