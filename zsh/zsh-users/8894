Is there a way to configure completion, so that it will first attempt
to only complete items that it would normally complete but are only in
the keep list of the keeper function, and if there is nothing there
complete as it normally would.

Said another way, take the intersection of the kept values and the
values the completer would normally complete in a given context.  Use
that intersection as the possible completions offered to the user.  If
the intersection is empty, the completer would complete as it does
normally.
