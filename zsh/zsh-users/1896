	Probably this will be a question more for admin but i wonder if I
can recive some help form you all guys.
	I'm having problems to save the zsh history file in the users
directories the file .zsh_history 
	I wonder if there is posible to save the .zsh_history in their
directories /home/user1/.zsh_history but with no privileges from user1 to
modify it or deleted.
	What I'm trying to do is to have a .zsh_history in users
directories that can save all the history of every single user in the
/home

	Can some one tell me if in the /etc/zshrc is posible to modify it
or do some trick to do this stuff that i'm trying to do.
Thank You
