It happens with bash too. Regarding login and interactive shell (bash or zsh)
when SHELL=/bin/bash is set underscore char in dir name causes:

Warning: Cannot change to /home/users/[....]/public_html

unset SHELL or export SHELL=sth_other_than_bash fixes it.
So check for SHELL value and blame mc-bash interaction.
