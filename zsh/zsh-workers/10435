*grin*  But presumably you were already auto-generating these with
emacs (C-x v a) or rcs2log so there wasn't much work involved anyway?

the /home/groups/zsh/zsh working copy automatically gets updated after
every commit (easily done) then it would be trivial to write a CGI
which makes this possible.
