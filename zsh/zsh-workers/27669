Subject: have '&' automatically disown?
Reply-To: gak@klanderman.net
X-Mailer: VM 8.0.12-devo-585 under 21.4 (patch 17) "Jumbo Shrimp" XEmacs Lucid (i386-redhat-linux)


Just wondering here.. I almost never use job control, and so almost
always use '&!' for background commands.  I was thinking it would
be nice to not have to type all those '!'s.. but I don't see a setting
to have '&' alone default to the disown behavior.  Is there some way
to do that which I've missed?

thanks,
Greg
