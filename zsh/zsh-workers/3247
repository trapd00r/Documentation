% zsh-3.0.3 -f
hzoli% setopt autoparamkeys completeinword 
hzoli% echo $ZSHSION 
   Cursor here: ^ press TAB then `:'
hzoli% echo $ZSH_VE:SION 

The patch below fixes that.  This is for zsh-3.0.3 but should also be
applied to zsh-3.1.2 (in the Src/Zle subdirectory).  Unfortunately
zsh-3.1.2 has some more fundamental problems here, which will hopefully
be addressed in a separate patch.
