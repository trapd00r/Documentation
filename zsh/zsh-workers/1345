} Please take a look if you're interested. We would appreciate any
} suggestions or comments (or better, patches) anyone may have.

I don't know if it's broken in the base document or if it's the fault
of texi2html, but double-quoted strings in some examples are really
messed up:


-H num pattern 
       [...snip...]
       A typical use is `compctl -D -f + -H 0 " -X '(No file found; using history)''

-l cmd
       [...snip...] 
       example, `compctl -x 'r[-exec,;]' -l " -- find'
