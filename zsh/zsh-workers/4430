I haven't used 3.1.* at all, so I'm just guessing here, but shouldn't
any builtin command that overrides an external command do _exactly_
what that external command was supposed to do?  Otherwise script
writers will have to use "command mv" or whatever, to guarantee that
they get a working "mv".

See the X/Open specification at
http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/7908799/xcu/mv.html for a
description of at least one "standard" for mv, which allows
cross-device moves.
