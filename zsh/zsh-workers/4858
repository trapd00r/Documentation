According to the Texinfo manual:

`@setchapternewpage odd'
     Cause TeX to start new chapters on new, odd-numbered pages
     (right-handed pages) and to typeset for double-sided printing.
     This is the form most often used for books and manuals.

So sticking this in the generated texi file ought to work.  I haven't
tried it.
