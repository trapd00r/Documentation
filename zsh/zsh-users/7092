It compiled ok on FreeBSD-5.1.  There was one issue though.  Configure
produced the following output.

checking pcre.h usability... yes
checking pcre.h presence... no
configure: WARNING: pcre.h: accepted by the compiler, rejected by the preprocessor!
configure: WARNING: pcre.h: proceeding with the preprocessor's result
configure: WARNING:     ## ------------------------------------ ##
configure: WARNING:     ## Report this to bug-autoconf@gnu.org. ##
configure: WARNING:     ## ------------------------------------ ##
checking for pcre.h... no

Although, it seems to have build the pcre.so module.

My system has a /usr/local/include/pcre.h header.  I also tried adding
the --includedir=/usr/local/include option to configure, but it still
produced the above warning.
