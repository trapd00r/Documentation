Hi!

How can I expand a variable which is in another variable?
Let me explain:

zsh$ TITI=somestuff
zsh$ GIGI=TITI  # NOT $TITI

What command I must enter in order to obtain "somestuff" and in this 
command must not appear TITI.
In fact I'm trying to use arrays with multiple dimensions (if this is 
possible).

Thank you for your help,

Stefanita
