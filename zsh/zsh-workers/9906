On FreeBSD -current, I dropped the tarfile in the distfiles dir, changed the
port Makefile and checksum file and did a make. This gave

utils.o: In function `gettempname':
utils.o(.text+0x1bfa): warning: mktemp() possibly used unsafely; consider
using mkstemp()

and

./zsh.texi:1069: warning: unlikely character [ in @var.
./zsh.texi:1069: warning: unlikely character ] in @var.
./zsh.texi:1573: warning: `.' or `,' must follow cross reference, not ).

I'm running it as my shell now. Seems to work just fine so far.

Thanks,
