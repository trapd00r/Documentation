Does this patch (to the zsh/complist module) fix it?  If not, could you
please tell us *exactly* what completion setup you have?  (I can't
reproduce this with just basic completion.)

If it does fix it, please don't ask me why.  (I'll delete the pws's if I
commit it, it's just to remind me I don't know what's going on.)
