It is, but it's hard to fix. In the first case the lexer reports the
whole string (`(I*)x', the `x' was added by the completion code) as a
string token. In the second case it reports the tokens for the `(' and 
so on separately. I'll have a deeper look into this, but not today, I
think.

Hm. With `execute-named-cmd' I see the list being pushed one line down 
and the prompt appearing above it. But with C-r and C-s I see the list 
being partly overwritten by the prompt.
