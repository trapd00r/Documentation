This is not exactly relevant, but I've always wanted the L (size)
qualifier to accept k or m (or K or M) as modifiers.  I never seem to
want to check for anything smaller than about 50k, in which case
zeros proliferate.  Often, I just assume it's there and find it
isn't.  Unfortunately there's never been a gap between feature freezes
long enough for me to write it.  It needs bearing in mind, though.
