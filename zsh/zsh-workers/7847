I've run out of sync, then, because I get it too. And no wonder, in
subst.c:1291 replstr is still unconditionally singsub()ed (and indeed
if I execute different expansions, I always get the previous $match[1] 
inserted). And even if I quote the $match[1], it will not be
singsub()ed again (or not correctly? there is no tokenize() before the 
singusb() at glob.c:1850).

Hm, so how is this supposed to work: with or without quoting the beast?

Bye
 Sven
