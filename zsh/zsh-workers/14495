This must be related to the patch from 14327.

I have a shell function:

    man () {
        command man $* | less -ais
    }

I discovered today that if I suspend this function with control-Z, it
vanishes entirely from the job tables and the `man' and `less' commands,
though stopped, are orphaned.
