Have you had a look at `_rpm'? It uses a (pseudo-endless-) loop with a 
`case' in it to handle the different states. The calls to `_arguments' 
then only have to use `->name' to make the code for the state `name'
to be executed in that loop (and use other completion code for the
`leafs', of course). Personally, I think that this is better readable, I 
don't want to say that everyone should use it, though.

Bye
 Sven
