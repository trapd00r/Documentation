Subject: Re: PATCH: return value for comp{add,gen}


[ I sent this yesterday, but it didn't make it through, it seems. ]

About 5634...

Bart just told me that there is a hunk in compwid.yo that failed. This
is the patch from 5621, sent again. You may savely ignore the failed
hunk. I apologise (seems I forgot to copy the file after that first
patch).


Bye
 Sven
