Define `standard place'.  We already have a zsh-specific lib directory;
it would be nice to keep all zsh's files together, and we can't assume
that any particular directory to which we can write will be searched by
default for libraries.

OK, better use that instead of -R.  Are there any platforms that need
libzsh but don't accept LD_RUN_PATH?  Or should I just assume that there
are, and write another configure test?

Hmmm ... I don't see a problem with temporarily setting
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PWD for testing purposes.  Still, as there does seem
to be some use in installing the library without the binary, I suppose
we should have a separate target for it.  I'd still like install.bin to
install the library, so that "make install.bin" will install a *usable*
binary on all systems.
