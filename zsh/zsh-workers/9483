Oops, no. Before the next official release we'll have to update
compconf() anyway. A ugly task, given the changes that were made to
the styles. I would much prefer to just remove compconf() and
compstyle() and let users who use 3.1.6 change their config stuff by
hand (at least compstyle() should be removed).

Bye
 Sven
