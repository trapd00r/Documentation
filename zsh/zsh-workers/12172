`:completion:*' is considered more specific only because there's one
more colon in it.

Hm. I hadn't thought about making later components be considered more
specific, it sounds sensible. But if combined with the existing rules
it would make it much more difficult to guess how specific a pattern
is, I think. And in the examples above, `completion' is after a colon, 
too, exactly like `options'. Unless we ignore leading colons withou
anything before them.
