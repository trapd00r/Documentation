In that case, do

local arr
arr=()

wherever necessary.  Now it even looks more like perl :-).  But
type-checking's a bit of chimera here:  there are many cases where
zsh will silently store a scalar into arr.  It does get the behaviour
of a subsequent 'arr[1]=foo' right, however: for example,

% unset arr
% arr[1]=foo arr[2]=foo
% print $arr
foo foo
% unset arr
% local arr
% arr[1]=foo arr[2]=foo
% print $arr
ffooo

In the first case it guesses it has to be an array, in the second it's
already been created as a scalar.  I suppose that's more or less what
you're worried about, in which case I recommend what I wrote above:  I
sometimes do that myself.
