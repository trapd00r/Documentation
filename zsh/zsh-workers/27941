That was exactly my question. Can a module change it's features per runtime=
?=20
Generally the use of the word feature in the doc is really confusing, readi=
ng the
coding makes it's even worse when a feature struct contains lists of builti=
ns,=20
condistions etc. which are called features too.

The doc also doesn't make very clear what abstracts.

I basically want to provide a builtin/feature/whatever that provides a way =
to add
actions in another language - ruby in my case.
