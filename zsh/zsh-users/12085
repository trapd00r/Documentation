I do something like this to interactively sandwich a command to run it
in gdb: 

   run-in-gdb() {
      # This function is ZLE widget that runs the current command in gdb.
      # It commits the current, unaltered command line to history, insets
      # its words in a gdb command, and runs it.
      print -s ${(z)BUFFER}
      BUFFER="gdb -x =(print run) --args $BUFFER"
      zle accept-line
   }
   zle -N run-in-gdb
   bindkey "^X^G" run-in-gdb

I just type the command normally, hit <Control-X><Control-G>, and gdb
takes the program and runs it.  You could do something similar but
insert pfexec instead.  But perhaps you're looking for something more
pervasive?
