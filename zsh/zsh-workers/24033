I didn't get this with a quick test; maybe there's some race in a make
dependency.  It should be handled by this in curses.mdd:


:<<\Make
curses.o curses..o: curses_keys.h

curses_keys.h: curses_keys.awk @CURSES_KEYS_H@
	$(AWK) -f $(sdir)/curses_keys.awk @CURSES_KEYS_H@ /dev/null \
	  >curses_keys.h


So even if there's no suitable header we should just get an empty set
of definitions.  CURSES_KEYS_H is supposed to get substituted
unconditionally even if it's empty.
