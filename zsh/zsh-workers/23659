Hi,

Reverse numeric sorting doesn't seem to work:

prunille% echo $ZSH_VERSION
4.3.4
prunille% foo=(a6 a117 a17 b6 b117 b17)
prunille% echo ${(n)foo}
a6 a17 a117 b6 b17 b117
prunille% echo ${(On)foo}
b6 b17 b117 a6 a17 a117

instead of

b117 b17 b6 a117 a17 a6

Also the man page is ambiguous:

Are the numbers (nonnegative) integer or floating-point numbers?

It also says: "if the first differing characters of two test strings
are not digits, sorting is lexical." then "Trailing non-digits are
not sorted; the order of `2foo' and `2bar' is not defined." But on
this example, the first differing characters are not digits, so that
the sorting should be lexical, hence defined!
