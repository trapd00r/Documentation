This one's easy to do with a function:

  setexport() { export $1=$2; }
  setexport BLAH *([-1])

It's harder if you're trying to do something that makes BLAH local to
the immediately enclosing scope---zsh lets you set variables globally or
in the current scope but not in the immediately surrounding scope---but
you don't want that in this case.
