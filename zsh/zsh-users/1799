} Actually, I tried just that - but I figured that it would not work
} as there is no directories /etc on Windows systems.  :-/

There is, however, a mkdir command ...

} And I always thought that the value of a variable on the DOS shell
} is "%var%" and not "$var".  or has this changed with WindowsNT?

It's a property of the shell (or rather, of command.com) not of the OS.
So yes, if you were running a DOS batch file, you would use %var%.
In zsh scripts, however, it's zsh that interprets the syntax, just as
it does on unix, so you use $var.

} The value of a variable on Windows cannot be used as $VAR (I think)
} but needs to be specified as %VAR% - and this is only possible in batch
} files.  Right or wrong?

Mostly wrong.

If what you want to do is set the variables for all Windows apps, e.g.
via the Environment tab in the System control panel, then you use %var%.
If you're putting the variables in a zsh startup file, you use $var.

} Remember that these rules apply only if don't set HOME. Since there is
} no /etc,  only the rules for locating files from $HOME are followed.

I don't have windows running at home, but yesterday I installed zsh.exe
on an NT machine at work.  I created a d:\etc (d: being the boot drive on
that machine) and put a zshenv file in it, and lo, zsh reads it.  So now
the setting of TERM=vt100 and adding the gnu-win32 bin to the path and so
on is in d:\etc\zshenv, and every user on that NT box gets it if they
start zsh.  (I also put in HOME=$HOMEDRIVE$HOMEPATH; what was the reason
for not defaulting $HOME from this on NT 4+ ?)
