} This can be used independently of 8824 if you take out
} the hunk for Src/Makefile.in.  Otherwise it's meant to
} follow it.

I'm not sure this is an improvement.  If you run "make install" from the
Src directory, you get different results than doing it from the top-level
directory.  (Of course, you always got different results WRT the Doc and
so forth, but you see what I mean.)
