That's ENOTTY, which some systems describe better as "inappropriate ioctl
for device".  (I once wrote a program that would fail with this error
if its output was actually a tty, with the amusing effect that on some
systems it says "Not a typewriter" if and only if it *is* a typewriter.)

>Anyone know how I can not have this ?

Make sure standard input and output are connected to a tty?
