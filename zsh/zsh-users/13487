I was thinking about that as I posted to the list, and since you pointed 
it out, maybe I'll get some general feedback... (sorry if this is too 
off-topic)

Like many users (I suspect), most of the systems I'm talking about here 
are essentially single-user systems. I log in under a normal user account, 
but the only reason not to log in as root is 'rm -rf /' protection. (i.e. 
so as to not cause unintentional damage.) On other systems, either:

1) I don't have root access, so this doesn't apply

2) The systems are properly secured (running/behind a firewall, 
non-essential services are off, passwords are strong, system is kept 
up-to-date, and I only ever log in to my normal account via SSH with keys) 
[modulo, of course, this discussion]

Am I really setting myself up for badness via this automated .zsh_* stuff?

And even beyond those reasons... I always got the impression that someone 
capable of using exploit X to break into a normal user's account had a 
pretty low barrier to using exploit Y to elevate their privileges to root. 
Is that not generally the case? [i.e. a system is only secure as its least 
secure user]

Best,
Ben
