I did not know about that option. I will report asap.

Btw, I've to correct myself with respect to LANG, since I wrote:

True, but setting LANG to "is_IS.ISO8859-1" once and then setting it
to anything else seems to do the trick as well:

Eight-bit-chars still work.

  > unset LANG

Seems dubious to me.
