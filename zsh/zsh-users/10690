Unfortunately, the documentation is "if you start zsh in sh mode [how to
do this is in the normal documentation, at least] it sort of works most
of the time".  I'm sure there are many bits that aren't quite right, but
nobody's kept track of them all, and I don't suppose anybody's got the
time.  It's one of the disadvantages of having only a handful of us
actively maintaining the internals in our spare time.  This task
wouldn't need familiarity with the C code, though.

One recent headline feature is that in 4.3 (but not 4.2) Wayne has fixed
it so that (as far as I know) word splitting in sh mode is according to
other shells.  That has probably been the most noticeable problem in
recent years.
