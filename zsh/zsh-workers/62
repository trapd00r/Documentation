oops. A broken strtol will probably give you

1..10

not

{1..10}

I still find it hard to believe that this would be
broken on Sun for so long (I get the above result on
SunOS 4.1.1/4.1.3, Solaris 2.3/2.4).  I was beginning
to think it was just my misunderstanding of the strtol
function until I tried it on Irix 5.3 (which gives the
correct result).
