I can't get this, even with zsh -f; it seems to work fine both with my
own completion set up and the plain old-fashioned defaul.  I'm using the
locale en_GB.UTF-8, but I tried it with ru_RU.UTF-8 as well.  What
actually are the contents of the directory (ls -a)?  What locale are you
using?  What version of the shell?  (UTF-8 support is new in 3.2, so if
it's older it won't work well.)
