For cisatlantic users, I put Zefram's version on the web at

http://www.ifh.de./~pws/computing/zsh-3.1.2-3.1.2-zefram3.diff.gz

(just the diff file).

I got this to compile by altering SHELL in both Src/Makefile and
Src/Makemod.in.in to point to a version of zsh running as ksh.  This
seems to be OK (I have zle compiled in).

One thing I've noticed is that the strftime sequences in the prompt
now print hours 1 to 9 with a space in front.  I don't know how that came
about.
