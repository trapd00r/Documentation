You can't use patterns with that form, which is the history modifier
syntax.  You can use patterns with this form:

echo ${fred/bu/hhh}

A useful trick with this form if you need to manipulate the matched
part is to use the (#m) extended globbing flag and the $MATCH variable:

% fred="hello harry"
% print ${fred//(#m)[aeiou]/${(U)MATCH}}
