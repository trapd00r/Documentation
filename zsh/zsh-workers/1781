Well, I have already fixed this, and in fact ${argv[0][0]} will work in pre4,
and more:

"${${(M)${(f@)$(<builtin.pro)}:%char*}[2][(w)3]}"

expands to the third word of the second line of builtin.pro which begins
with char.

This is really a side effect of a fix to the ${foo[1]} bug when foo is
unset.  Peter had a fix for that as well but I did not like that much.  It
was quite easy to do that, but big chunks of the code had to be reindented
so the diff's may look big.
