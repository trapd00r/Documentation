    Bart, you're a fucking genius (no matter if this message ends up
censored...). I want to give thanks to Thorsten for having the great
idea of classifying the options and to you for such a good
categorization.

    This mailing list really amazes me... And Zsh, obviously, too.
I'm looking for things that cannot be done with Zsh, and I must admit
it doesn't make a good coffee XDDD

    Thanks, I mean it.
