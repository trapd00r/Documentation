You should probably use zsh's own function ztrftime (in utils.c), which
calls strftime if that's available, else does some of the simpler formats,
and makes a couple of extra formats available.  If that doesn't seem
appropriate for some reason, at least test for HAVE_STRFTIME which is
already handled by configure.

I suppose it would be better in its own module, or else a module
timeutils or stringutils if there's any more stuff that can usefully be
collected.
