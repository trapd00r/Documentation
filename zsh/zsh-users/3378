Wow! They were missing here as well :-) (but our compiler was more benign)

I just found, that these live in -lresolv here. Damn, some developers should
be shoot on the spot ... the problem (here, at least) is, that -lresolv MUST
be after -lnsl (else name resolution won't work), so usual configure checks
won't work ... I have to think about it.

Check, in which library these function live under Solaris. I suspect, they are
in -lresolv as well. For now you may manually edit config.h and Makefile(s) to
add needed library and set #define HAVE_missing_function for all of them. The
correct configure test is not as easy and it is too late already :-)
