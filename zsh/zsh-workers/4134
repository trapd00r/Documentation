} I suppose an extra state flag, to disable REC_EXACT would be reasonable.
} Set the flag when completion inserts text, and clear it when any other
} editing action occurs.  Would this give the semantics you want?

Yes, but it's probably more general than necessary.  The only time the
semantics I want are interesting is when automenu is in effect, and
there is already a state flag for that (or was the last time I looked,
which was admittedly quite a while ago).  It'd probably be sufficient
to disable recexact when the automenu state flag is set.
