    With GNU things, don't rely on manpages, rely on the info
documentation (yes, I hate that format too, but...). In the --help
output the "--args" option is slightly documented (being "slightly"
the keyword here...).

    Unfortunately, not all software is as well documented as zsh,
specially GNU software.

    I'm using your widget right now with a friend's ftp server that
forces me to do "epsv4 off" in my ftpclient each time I connect. As I
said, this is quite useful :))
