Hi all,

is it possible to turn of the hashing of named directories during
completion? I'm using named directories as

hash -d foo=${HOME}/bar

but the completion of user directories interferes and forces me to type
more characters as necesarry.

I tried to empty the hash table (hash -d -r) and it is working. But
during the first completion the named user directories are added to the
table again:

% hash -d -r
% hash -d
% cd ~<Tab>
user
[...]

It's probably hidden somewhere in a completion widget/zstyle (I'm not
really familiar with the nomenclature)?

Thanks
    eike
