 "is yodl required to build zsh?" (Jul 25,  1:31am)

Yodl is required to build zsh straight out of CVS, because it is assumed 
that only developers do so and that all developers will install the full
suite of tools needed.

The "stable" releases come in two parts, source and documentation, and
if you first unpack the source and then unpack the documentation, you
end up with a directory tree in which yodl is not required for "make".
However, unpacking the stable doc into the CVS sandbox does not work,
because new doc files have been added since the last stable release.
