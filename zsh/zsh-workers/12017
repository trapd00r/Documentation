} This can be done by testing "compset -P '='" and stripping off the mail
} directory in the same way it's already done for various types of mailbox

As we've seen, this is apparently already handled because the `=' appears
in the list of mailbox names in ~/.muttrc, which zsh greps for.  Adding
the `compset -P' might actually break things.

Consequently, I'm not going to do any surgery on this at all.  Somebody
who actually uses mutt (Clint?) should wield the scalpel if it's needed.
