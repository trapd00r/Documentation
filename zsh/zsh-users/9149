.zshrc is only sourced for interactive shell.  A script is considered
non-interactive.  .zshenv is *always* loaded (except if your admin
unsetopt's RCS in /etc/zshenv, but that would be idiotic).  Yet,
that's not the answer to your problems.

No, Bart's right in <1050724232221.ZM26877@candle.brasslantern.com>.
Extended_glob is not necessary for **.

Yet, the manual states (FILENAME GENERATION > Recursive Globbing):

       As a shorthand, `**/' is equivalent to `(*/)#'; note  that
       this  therefore  matches files in the current directory as
       well as subdirectories.

And earlier on (FILENAME GENERATION > Glob Operators):

       x#     (Requires EXTENDED_GLOB to be set.)   Matches  zero
              or  more occurrences of the pattern x. 

Should we fix the manual?

Phil.
