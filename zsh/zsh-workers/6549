I don't see that it's that hard to tell a user `add the following to your
.zshrc', or have it in /etc/zshrc, or let them run compinstall.  Maybe the
manual could provide a simple one-line suggestion, though, for anyone not
wanting to run compinstall  --- possibly the manual could be altered to
contain the real location of compinit, but that will require more remaking
than seems a good idea.

(Autoloading everything in $fpath could conflict with Bart's `autoload -U'
suggestion --- although I presume that first autoloading without -U, then
with, will add the NOALIASES flag.)  This complicates installation,
however, and Oliver was suggesting he'd prefer the directory structure
retained.  I haven't worked out a simple way of doing all this.

Yes, it may be too heavily biassed towards people developing rather than
using the system.

I don't know when I'll get a chance to look at this, I have about 50
different things to do at once, so if someone has a way of simplifying all
this so much the better.
