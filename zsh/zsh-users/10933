PATH should be defined in your .profile as it's a setting for
your session, not for your shell only.

That indicates you are in vi mode. It shouldn't be related to
$PATH. What is possible is that you have a bindkey -e (for
switching to emacs mode) in .profile, .zprofile, .zlogin,
/etc/profile, /etc/zprofile or /etc/zlogin instead of .zshrc
(here, it's a shell setting).

Adding:

bindkey -e 

to your ~/.zshrc should force the emacs mode. zsh may have
chosen vi mode by default because you have the $VISUAL or
$EDITOR variable set to vi.
