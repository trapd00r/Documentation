Subject: Is this a bug or a thinko?
MIME-Version: 1.0

I've just been noticing several places where the completion system does
comparisons like

	[[ CURRENT -eq 1 ]]

In my patched version of 3.1.9-dev-6, CURRENT in this context is NOT being
interpreted as a math expression.  That is, one must do

	[[ $CURRENT -eq 1 ]]

to get the correct result.

Is failure to use math context in this situation a recently-introduced bug?
Or have the completion functions been wrong all along?
