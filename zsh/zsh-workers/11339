} This patch is a proposed test for completion matching.  I was able to
} get this test to pass with my latest build of zsh.

The test fails for me with the following output; I had to capture this
with "make check >& file" because of the four carriage-returns in the
last line of the diff:

*** /tmp/zsh.ztst.out.4987	Fri May 12 00:27:35 2000
--- /tmp/zsh.ztst.tout.4987	Fri May 12 00:27:40 2000

*** 1,2 ****
  line: {tst }{}
! COMPADD:{_tst:compadd: unknown match specification character `z'}
--- 1,2 ----
  line: {tst }{}
! COMPADD:{_tst:compadd: unknown match specification character `z'}
Test ../../zsh-3.1.6/Test/54compmatch.ztst failed: output differs from expected as shown above for:
 test_code z: list1
 comptest  -c "$code" $'tst \t'
Was testing: Match Error for "z:"
../../zsh-3.1.6/Test/54compmatch.ztst: test failed.

} Also, I'm using test 54, to come after the more generic completion test.

I suppose that makes sense, but we've been talking about renumbering all
the tests above 50 ...
