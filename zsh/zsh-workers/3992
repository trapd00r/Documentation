} The standard does not mention PWD or OLDPWD in the descriprion of the

Personally, I rather like having PWD be a special parameter.  If you go
by the letter of that standard you quoted, PWD would not be set at all
when the shell first started up; it would only become set after a "cd".
That's surely bogus.

I'm all for following standards when the difference is meaningful in some
way, but this seems entirely gratuitous.
