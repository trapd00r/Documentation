In addition to the >&- test for which I have done no followup, I note
the following other problems in testsuiteland:

If $HOME does not exist or is not writable, many tests go awry.  Arguably, this is user error.

In some environments, I get this
../../Test/A01grammar.ztst: starting.
*** /tmp/zsh.ztst.err.22699	Mon Dec 24 21:24:33 2007

Test ../../Test/A01grammar.ztst failed: error output differs from expected as shown above for:
  (COLUMNS=80
  PS3="input> "
  select name in one two three; do
    print $name
  done)
Was testing: `select' loop
../../Test/A01grammar.ztst: test failed.

Finally, if D07multibyte.ztst is skipped due to a lack of UTF-8 locale, it seems as though that is
being registered as a failure. Perhaps a distinct exit code should be used for skips (and counting
such in runtests.zsh).
