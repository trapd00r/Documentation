Of course not. The `:completion:*:default' you gave is less specific
than the thing currently used as default.

These are just normal shell-patterns. So `::' matches only `::' and
`:*:' matches `:anything:' and a `*' of course matches any number of
parts (I'm not too happy about that last one).

I think I prefer Peter's suggestion to get rid of the default styles
in compinit and just make them the defaults used by the completion
functions that use these styles.
