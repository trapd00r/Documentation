Sorry, no patches this time, just a report.

Starting with:

  zagzig[42] bindkey -v
  zagzig[43] echo this is a line

cursor after "line", type ESC dd P j.  Note that you end up on the line
below the prompt, even though there was no newline in what was deleted.
Now type p.  Note that you end up with:

  zagzig[43] echo this is a line

  echo this is a line

with the cursor between the two lines.  So far 3.0.5 and 3.1.5 have the
same bug.  Type j j, note feep on second attempt to move down a line.
Now type k dd.  In 3.0.5, the blank line is deleted, but in 3.1.5 all you
get is a feep.  The only way to get rid of the blank line in 3.1.5 is to
move up to the previous line and type J.
