Reading the User's Guide again[1] an idea came to my mind that would
compensate for an inability of the current implementation of the
"right prompt":

I have my pwd ("%~") in my RPROMPT (as probably many people). When the
path to the pwd is long (or I type a long command line) the rprompt
disappears and makes place for my typing.

This is a feature and generally a good thing but the problem is that
the /whole/ rprompt disappears and not just the space I need.

Just a "picture" for what I would like:

current:
thorsten@galactus% 12345678 /cygdrive/g/home/thorsten/ifolder/gentoo/conf/kernel
thorsten@galactus% 123456789

desired:
thorsten@galactus% 12345678 /cygdrive/g/home/thorsten/ifolder/gentoo/conf/kernel
thorsten@galactus% 123456789 [...]/g/home/thorsten/ifolder/gentoo/conf/kernel
thorsten@galactus% 1234567890  [...]/home/thorsten/ifolder/gentoo/conf/kernel

Is that already possible? Or an easy to implement case for the
wishlist?

Thanks,
Thorsten

[1] "Prompts or parts of prompts, not just bits showing the directory,
can be truncated to any length you choose. To truncate a path on the
left, use something like ¡%10<...<%~¢. That works like this: the
¡%<<¢ is the basic form for truncation. The 10 after the ¡%¢ says
that anything following is limited to 10 characters, and the
characters ¡...¢ are to be displayed whenever the prompt would
otherwise be longer than that (you can leave this empty). This
applies to anything following, so now the %~ can¢t be longer than 10
characters, otherwise it will be truncated (to 7 characters, once the
¡...¢ has been printed)."
