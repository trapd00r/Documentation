zsh -fc "bindkey '^o' history-beginning-backward && echo $widgets"

crashes the shell

zsh -fc "bindkey '^o' history-beginning-backwards && echo $widgets"

crashes the shell

zsh -fc "bindkey '^o' history-beginning-forward && echo $widgets"

crashes the shell

zsh -fc "bindkey '^o' history-beginning-<TAB> && echo $widgets"
crashes the shell

the attempt to let completion work crashes the shell.
> This is a bug when there is no widget with the supplied name;

Sadly not only in that case!
