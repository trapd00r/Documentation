Yet that was it ... so in my .zlogin I added, 

	stty intr '^C' susp '^Z' ...

susp was ^@ before I got to it and intr was DEL of all things?  But this
is apparently the default under IRIX.  My default /etc/cshrc for the *Csh
users includes the line,

	stty intr '^C' echoe

It is true, you learn something new everyday ... ;)

Thanks for the help,

--ryan
