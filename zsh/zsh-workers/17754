You're right, that was the full error line. I didn't put the rm because
i thought it wasn't important, my fault.

I've been trying to raise some limits, but none of them affect the number of 
parameters execve() supports, maybe is possible to change it in linux through
some /proc variable, or a kernel recompilation is needed.

I just wanted to know if this was a zsh related problem, now i'll look forward
to know how to change execve limits.

Thanks to all the replies ;),
