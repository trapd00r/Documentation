Subject: A failure in Y03arguments.ztst

I'm seeing this failure in the latest CVS version:

Y03arguments.ztst: starting.
*** /tmp/zsh.ztst.out.22230     Mon Feb  9 18:39:31 2004

--- 1 ----
! line: {tst arg1 }{}
Test Y03arguments.ztst failed: output differs from expected as shown above for:
 tst_arguments ':desc1:(a b)'
 comptest $'tst \t'
Was testing: a and b
Y03arguments.ztst: test failed.

This is on a Red Hat 7.3 system.  Is anyone else getting this?
