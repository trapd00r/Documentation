I suspect he is refering to the traditional vi behavior of
vi-backward-delete-char documented in "info zsh 'Modifying
Text'"

vi-backward-delete-char (unbound) (X) (^H)
     Delete the character behind the cursor, without changing lines.
     If in insert mode, this won't delete past the point where insert
     mode was last entered.

So I suspects he wants instead:

if (($+terminfo[kbs])); then
  bindkey -M viins $terminfo[kbs] backward-delete-char
else
  bindkey -M viins '^?' backward-delete-char
  bindkey -M viins '^H' backward-delete-char
fi
(($+terminfo[kdch1])) &&
  bindkey -M viins $terminfo[kdch1] delete-char


The above trys to map the emacs-style (as opposed to vi style)
backward-delete-char to the character sent by the backspace key
(using the terminfo database if it's there, or hardcoding both
^? and ^H). It also maps delete-char to the character sent by
the delete key if the terminfo database has that information.
Note that on a number of terminals, backspace sends ^H and
delete ^? while in a number of others backspace sends ^? and
delete something else like the sequence \e[3~
