I forgot to follow up to this earlier.  This turned out to be due to an
alias I have for "ls" (ls="command ls --color=auto -CF").  Oops!

This does bring up an interesting point about the exclusions that are
currently in the completion system.  With a utility like ls, conflicting
options are accepted, with the last one having precedence.  So, even
though my alias specifies -C, I can still override that with -x.  So,
should we avoid excluding options that may conflict ideologically as
long as they don't conflict syntactically?
