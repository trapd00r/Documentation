Also, I've started mirroring CVS HEAD in Arch; this can be accessed by

% tla register-archive schizo@debian.org--2004-zsh-upstream-cvs-head \
 	http://arch.debian.org/arch/private/schizo/2004-zsh-upstream-cvs-head
 
% tla get schizo@debian.org--2004-zsh-upstream-cvs-head/zsh--cvshead

The cronjob runs every 2 hours, and uses Sourceforge anonymous CVS, so
unless something breaks, it shouldn't lag behind by more than 3 hours or
so.

This experiment is predicated on the theory that it'll be easier to
merge stuff from HEAD via an Arch repo.
