# This function behaves as if you have a matcher definition like:
#   compctl -M 'r:|[-.,_/]=* r:|=* m:{a-z}={A-Z} m:-=_ m:.=,' \
#              'm:{a-z}={A-Z} l:|=* r:|=*'
# so you may want to modify this.

I think, it is unacceptable. It is the same, as if users had to modify C
sources to change compctl behaviour. I'd suggest, that __path_files would
take -M argument to do the same.
