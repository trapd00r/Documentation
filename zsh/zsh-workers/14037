It adds the library to LIBS, which would be counterproductive.

I can't compile current CVS on Solaris 8, or I'd check.  -lnsl should
already be in the main module, because that's where yp_all is called.
I'll add -lsocket to zftp.mdd.

Are you saying that all the libraries that any DSO's are linked against
need to be linked to the main binary?

We should probably start branching in CVS.
