Cool stuff, thanks man!

Although, what does each column represent?

I'm still on a "which is really the colors in my prompt" since
I haven't gotten by the whole:

/etc/zshrc:32: parse error near `)'
$a1}($a2}kyrre$a3}@$a2}merhaba$a1})

Stage so I can test them all yet.

I also have a dark grey color which doesn't seem to be on this list.

Thanks so far though!

All the best,
Kyrre
