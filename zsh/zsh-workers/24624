} This looks to be a side effect of 24570. Any ideas?

Scrap the part of _path_commands that reads "whatis" output?  As I said
in 24570, I think that was a truly horrible idea in the first place.

Or at least protect it with a style that is not generally set for any
other purpose.

The workaround for Romain is probably to enable caching of the output
by creating a cache-policy style for :completion::complete:-command-::
context.
