Subject: What happened to article 11864?
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

I got a Cc of it by private mail, but it never reached the archives and I
never saw the original across the list.  (I believe what I got to be 11864
because it arrived between 11863 and 11865 and both of those *are* in the
archive; as a Cc, it of course had no X-Seq field.)

The message was from Alexandre and I thought it was for the bug that Sven
just patched in 11875, but perhaps it was for a different one (and I didn't
save a copy) of the message).
