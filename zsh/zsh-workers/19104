OK, I think I see what's going on now.

!-history is in use because:
 - the shell is interactive, and
 - shell input is standard input

shout gets set if:
  - the shell is interactive, and
  - SHTTY is set

SHTTY is set if and only we are talking to a tty on fd 0, and we aren't.
We can't very well set it or shout in that case.  (We could in principle
look harder for a tty, but that's not the issue here --- there just
isn't one.)

In that case, I think the right thing to do might be the following.
Presumably this bug has been there forever.

Comments?
