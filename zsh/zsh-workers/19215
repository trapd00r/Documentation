Subject: Build problem on terminfo.c on FreeBSD 4.7
To: zw <zsh-workers@sunsite.dk>
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Since Clint's changes (zsh-workers/19076) I'm seeing build problems with
terminfo.c on FreeBSD 4.7:

terminfo.c: In function `boot_':
terminfo.c:381: warning: implicit declaration of function `setupterm'
terminfo.c:381: `ERR' undeclared (first use in this function)
terminfo.c:381: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
terminfo.c:381: for each function it appears in.)

ERR is defined in curses.h.  Not sure why that is not included, because the
autoconf code is opaque to me.

-FR.
