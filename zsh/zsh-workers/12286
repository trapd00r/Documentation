The scripts I'm talking about are far far away from enabling bells and
whistles.  They just have a few things to smooth the edges of an
otherwise very raw installation.

[As an aside, I sometimes wonder why we don't make a
bells-and-whistles out of the box install of zsh much more easily
obtainable.  After all, the vast majority of people only use zsh for
its bells and whistles.]

Or in the example startups, but commented out.  Remember, if we
provide a decent set of RedHat (say) startup scripts, it's likely that
within two years every recent RedHat box will have them installed, and
most people aren't going to be looking at the zsh web site when
they're editing them.

Which is exactly what StartupFiles/RedHat/* would be, no?
