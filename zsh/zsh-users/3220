       just cam across this:
       http://www.tochna.technion.ac.il/projects/oldprojects/ntcsh/

       Basically:
        command @machine
        invokes command at machine,
        carrying over the environment.
        can do pipes !! ( internally reverts to socket, of course ).
        

      IMHO good candidate for creeping featureism in zsh.
