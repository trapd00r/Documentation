} You setopt extendglob in your zshrc, which is not sourced for your
} script.

Good guess, but extendedglob is not required for **/ to work.

More likely is that there is a "cd" command in some startup file
that the script *does* read, such as ~/.zshenv.

Try changing the script to start with

    #!/bin/zsh -x

so you can see a trace of the commands that it is executing.  Remove
the -x again after you fix whatever is wrong, of course.
