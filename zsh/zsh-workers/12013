Sorry. I meant `... in combination with completion'. How often have
you completed one of the strings you used on a command line last year
(and which didn't appear in the history since then)?

I.e. maybe we could add a style to _history* to complete only the last 
N words/lines. Probably a bit like that example code in _first,
i.e. try the last N words/lines, if that doesn't yield matches, try
the last 2N words/lines, and so on.

Bye
 Sven
