Subject: [PATCH] _git shouldn't return 0 if there are no matches

This patch fixes the problem that the _git completion function returns 0
even if no matches were generated (which leads to any additional
completers not being executed).

_git handles the completion for a sub-command such as "git foo" by
calling the function _git-foo via _call_function.  Without this patch,
_git then returns the status returned by _call_function (which is 0 if
_call_function was able to call _git-foo) instead of the status returned
by _git-foo.
