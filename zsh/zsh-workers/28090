I was getting:
fatal: ambiguous argument 'HEAD': unknown revision or path not in the working tree.
Use '--' to separate paths from revisions

To reproduce, just run 'git init' in an empty directory then run
'git diff-index HEAD' or any variant of it.

I did not realize that - the doc for git diff-index --exit-code did not
mention it. However, it's still better being safe than sorry :)

(( $? && $? != 128 )) looks good & works fine for me.
