} Hm, my bad English shows... There doesn't seem to be a point in what?

There doesn't seem to be a reason to have a ZLS_COLORS parameter at all.

} Incremental completion is a hack, yes. Have you had a look at
} predict-on lately? It can do completion, too, nowadays.

incremental-complete-word is somewhat vi-like (modal) even though editing
within it is emacs-like.  predict-on is more like an emacs minor mode.
I haven't ever tried combining predict-on with menu-select ...

BTW, predict-on is still using _style as well.  Is this the correct fix?
