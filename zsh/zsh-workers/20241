I'm confused by this suggestion.  If there's no options tag, the tag-order 
doesn't make any difference, because it's in the second group of tags.  
And in the case of cdrecord, there _is_ an options tag.  How would that
proposed change help?

Why is that not possible?  For example, several completion functions set 
the cache-policy style if it's not already set.
