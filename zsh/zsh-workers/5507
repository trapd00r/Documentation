My mistake. I meant, new completion:

setopt extendedglob
[[ -f ~/.zsh/completion/init ]] && source ~/.zsh/completion/init

Is there anything else starting
> with `u' in `/' or something else that might make this fail?

bor@itsrm1:~/src/zsh-3.1.5-pws-9%> ls -Fd /u*
/u/         /unix*      /unix.old*  /usr/       /utmp/

/usr is shown as directory, but it looks like a bug in ls. 

ls -F / =>
... usr@ ...

/u is NFS mounted.

cheers
