From: Peter Stephenson <pws@ibmth.df.unipi.it>

I tried to add these lines to the top of _main_complete so that listing
widgets could be made to use an existing list of completions.

if [[ $WIDGET = *list* && -n $compconfig[old_list] &&
  -n $compstate[old_list] &&
  ( $compconfig[old_list] = always || $compstate[old_list] != shown ) ]]; then
  compstate[old_list]=keep
  return
fi

But when I start a non-contextual completion, and the list is displayed by
autolist, and I then type ^D, this doesn't work --- it seems
$compstate[old_list] is not set.  Is this just me?
