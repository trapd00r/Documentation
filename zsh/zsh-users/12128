Subject: List default values in zshoptions(1)?
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Content-Disposition: inline

Hi all,

is there any interest in listing the default set/unset state for
options in the zshoptions man page? I myself often look that
up manually and would love this to be listed. If others agree,
I would probably whip up a patch soonish and submit it.

I would have written this to the workers mailing list, but
somehow, all my subscription emails disappear without any
reply or bounce. Is that list closed? Am I too stupid? Does
GMail have a hiccup?


Richard
