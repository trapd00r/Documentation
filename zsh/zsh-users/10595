It seems that the hash table is initialized after .zshrc is read.  Is
there a way to run some scripts after everything is initiaziled?

I just stuck

[[ -n $(whence script) ]] && unhash script

in my .zshrc and figured that it'd work ($path being set in my
.zprofile).  That failing, I put a "rehash" before that line.  I still
get

/home/now/.local/etc/zsh/.zshrc:unhash:36: no such hash table element: script

What am I missing?

And thanks for the very complete answer.  Too bad none of the
solutions seem to work very well.
