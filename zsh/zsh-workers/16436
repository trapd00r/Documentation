If you describe incompatible arguments in _arguments like

(-foo)-bar
(-bar)-foo

and try to complete with -foo on the line -bar is not listed as an
option. But if you start from empty line, both are listed and you can
also insert both of them.

Just curious how hard would it be for accept-and-menu-complete to
respect incompatible arguments in this case?
