Thanks Peter

Let me increase verbosity to describe the desired functionality.

I would like to have certain commands automatically run this function.
This I currently do with the following:
#compdef vim less sed perl ooffice ...

<function_definition>

Then I would like to type
"ooffice foo"

And the function would execute:
ooffice foo

if file foo existed, otherwise it would execute:

ooffice *foo*(om[1])

I would like this to be as efficient as possible.

Eric
