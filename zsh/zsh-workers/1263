} I had to link /bin/sh to zsh in order to make automatic tex font
} generation work. However, zsh (called as sh), doesn't run this script:

This seems to be the problem:

======
bash:

$ [ ! ] && echo OK
OK
======
True Bourne shell:

$ [ ! ] && echo OK
[: argument expected
======
zsh:

% [ ! ] && echo OK
[: argument expected
======

So I think zsh is OK in this case.

Here's the culprit in the script:

	if [ ! $APS_BASEDIR ]; then

This isn't a very portable script in the first place.  A better test for
a variable being unset would be:


	if [ -z "$APS_BASEDIR" ]; then
