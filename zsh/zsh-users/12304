The man page concerning setopt and unsetopt (with no arguments) should
be clarified. I've never understood what "setopt" and "unsetopt" give
exactly: why are some versions with "no" listed in setopt and some of
them in unsetopt?

It seems that setopt gives the differences from the default (but what
is the default?). However:

courge:~> zsh -f -c setopt
norcs
shinstdin

Why shinstdin?

This seems to contradict the zshoptions(1) man page.
