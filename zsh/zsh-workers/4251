} Or perhaps you mean "what quotings are recognized in the replacement text
} that results from which substitutions/expansions?"  Again, the answer is
} that none are.  Expansions (except alias expansion, but including history,
} now that the old lexical history options are gone) are already tokenized

I apologize; this is not entirely accurate.  History is expanded whenever
the lexer requests the next character of input; aliases are expanded after
the lexer has recognized an unquoted word, but before that word is checked
against the reserved words.  History is "tokenized" in the sense that it
is stored as an array of words, but those words are rescanned by the lexer
when expanded.

I'm surprised Zefram and PWS didn't jump on me for this one.
