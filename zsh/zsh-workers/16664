The patch certainly seems to do the trick... I don't think anything more
sophisticated is needed with singlelinezle.  If you commit this, I'll
produce 4.1.0-dev-4, since it's high time.  It could also go on the 4.0
line.

There's no target date for 4.1.1; I'm still vaguely waiting for some
major change to justify it, in particular improvements in the parameter
code to make things like discipline functions easier.  But every time I
look at the code I stop looking at it after a bit.  The only vague
conclusion I've come to is that it might be a good idea to use some form
of vtable for storing stuff common to all parameters of a particular
type, which would save a bit of space with negligible impact on
performance.  But since discipline functions have to be specific to
individual parameters, it doesn't help us there at all.
