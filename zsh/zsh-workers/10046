k
     If used in a subscript on a parameter that is not an associative
     array, this behaves like `r', but if used on an association, it
     makes the keys be interpreted as patterns and returns the first
     value whose key matches the EXP.

K
     On an associtation this is like `k' but returns all values whose
     keys match the EXP. On other types of parameters this has the same
     effect as `R'.
