According to the manual:

i
     Like `r', but gives the index of the match instead; this may not be
     combined with a second argument.  On the left side of an
     assignment, behaves like `r'.  For associative arrays, the key
     part of each pair is compared to the pattern, and the first
     matching key found is the result.  On failure substitutes one more
                                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
     than the last currently valid index, as discussed under the
     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
     description of `r'.
     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

That's why you get:

$ zsh -f -c 'a=(b); echo ${a[(i)a]}'
2

And I thought you should get 1 (1 more than the first valid
index)

$ zsh -f -c 'a=(); echo ${a[(i)a]}'
1
