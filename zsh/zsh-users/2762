I've tried this under version 3.1.6 (on HP-UX version 11.0):

	= typeset -u -x aaa=bbb
	= echo $aaa
	BBB
	= zsh
	= echo $aaa
	bbb
	=

Am I missing something, or has ZSH neglected to pass on the uppercase
property to the subshell?  I get the same results when the HP posix sh is
the subshell.  When I do the entire experiment with sh, I get the expected
results ($aaa is always BBB).

I  wasn't able to find a buglist, so I'm noting this here.  If there is a
buglist, please point me at it.  Thanks.
