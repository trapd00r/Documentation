================

i'm sure there's other ways to do this, but i do something like this...

find /path -param | while read n
do
 	cmd1 $n ; cmd2 $n
 	cmd3 $n
done

as long as there aren't white spaces in the output of find, everything 
stays simple. off the top of my head, i think that white spaces can be 
handled by double-quoting references to $n.
