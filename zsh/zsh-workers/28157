To generate the manuals, you need the `yodl' package.

>From a fresh checkout, here's what I usually do:

% ./Util/preconfig
% /configure  --enable-cap --enable-function-subdirs \
              --enable-largefile --enable-maildir-support \
              --enable-multibyte --enable-pcre --enable-zsh-debug
% make
% su
# make install

Then when you've crashed the application, you can load the core file
together with the program's binary and use the "bt full" command to
produce a backtrace.

To put the backtrace to a file, the following oneliner works:

% gdb -c core /usr/local/bin/zsh <<< $'bt full\nquit\n' > backtrace.txt

Where `core' is the core file and `/usr/local/bin/zsh' being the
installed zsh binary which you just crashed.

The backtrace will only be useful if the zsh binary is from a debugging
build.
