Ah, it's because of the fix that //% didn't do the same as what /% did
--- they should both treat the % specially as an instruction to anchor
the match at the end of the string.  Logically, it should also have been
quoted, so this fix is correct.  (I find it an annoying notation for
just this sort of reason; zsh's substitution flags are much neater, but
this form is compatible with other shells.)
