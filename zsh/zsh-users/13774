Hi,

I'm currently using this matcher-list setting:

zstyle ':completion:*' matcher-list '' 'm:{a-zA-Z}={A-Za-z}' '+ l:|=* r:|=*'

Is there any way to have the substring completion not match an
underscore at the beginning of the trial completion?

I think I essentially want 'l:|=[^_]*' but ordinary shell patterns
do not seem to be supported.

thanks,
Greg
