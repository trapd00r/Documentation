This passed me by, and it obviously needs changing, but the awk stuff is a
bit minimal.  I had a perl script to search for targets, which at least
joined together multiple lines and eliminated variables.  But we've been
trying not to rely on perl.  It could be done within the shell, possibly as
a single substitution, but I'm not sure I like that idea either.
