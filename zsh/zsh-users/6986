Have you got the dlcompat library installed? If you look at
Etc/MACHINES it mentions that it is needed.

Is dlcompat still needed under 10.3.1? i.e. have you just got dlcompat
there as part of something like fink or has Apple added native support
for dlopen etc?

I think that ..o is intentional somewhere for some reason.

Your suggested change for the test's help info sounds sensible.
