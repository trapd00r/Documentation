Check these settings: <http://zshwiki.org/home/options/expn>

And also see what the difference between

  % echo non-existing-file.*
and
  % echo non-existing-file.*(N)

is.

That's documented in 'man zshexpn' and a list of available modifiers
and flags is also in <http://www.bash2zsh.com/zsh_refcard/refcard.pdf>.
