The behaviour of vi-goto-column has changed: it now won't go to the
last column, i.e. the space after all the characters.  This was
presumably introduced by some mistaken analogy with vi, where there is
no space at the end of the line after the last inserted character.  In
zsh there is (remember, ^[| can be called from emacs mode) and there
is no reason why the shell shouldn't go to it.  The change has already
caused problems here.  The excuse `we randomly changed this because we
thought it would be nice if it did something else' is not widely
accepted (to put it mildly) by users and system managers.

   ^ typing ^[2^[| here goes to the first character instead of staying put.
