} Presumably it also stores whether the function was autoloaded with the
} -U option. Looks like there is a PM_UNALIASED flag. Maybe we can just
} add PM_ZSHSTORED and PM_KSHSTORED flags.

Yes, that would probably work.

Here's a possibly-silly idea:  Those flags could be made to apply to
arrays as well as functions, so one could have both zero-based and one-
based indexing independent of the ksharrays option.  (-k and -z are not
currently used by typeset except in its autoload incarnation.)
