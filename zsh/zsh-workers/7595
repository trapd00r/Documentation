From: Peter Stephenson <pws@ibmth.df.unipi.it>

I suspect there may be an untokenization problem in the new parameter
flags, or is the following expected for some reason?

% print ${(%):-%~}       

% print "${(%):-%~}"
/temp/pws/zsh-beta/Src

(by the way, is it supposed to work like that without a parameter name, or
is it just coincidence, because it's quite convenient?)

I haven't attempted to fix this because I haven't understood what all the
metafy/unmetafy bits are doing.  But it should presumably be safe to
untokenize while it's still metafied.  It's probably naive to hope
everything could be untokenized earlier on.  Then there's remnulargs, or
maybe not.  Good luck.
