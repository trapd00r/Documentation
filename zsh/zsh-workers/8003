So you mean

	neither option = remove all duplicates
	-1 = keep non-consecutive duplicates and remove consecutive duplicates
	-2 = keep all duplicates

OK

That can't be right.  -J1 should be removing consecutive duplicates,
i.e., all duplicates due to the sorting.  Shouldn't it?

This looks fishy too.
