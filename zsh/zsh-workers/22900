Hello,

After upgrading to 4.3.2, I've found that one of the features I love in zsh is
broken, namely the possibility to use the history file for both root and
non-root sessions.  Now, after I logout from "sudo zsh", I get this:

   zsh: can't write history file /home/dk/.zsh-history

I found that it is savehistfile() to blame, because it apparently is called
with writeflags=0, which bypasses all append/rewrite logic, falling back to
saving the file by renaming it to .zsh-history.new, and (correctly) refusing to
overwrite .zsh-history because the euid is different. If I'm correct in
this, the patch below fixes the problem:

            histactive = remember_histactive;
