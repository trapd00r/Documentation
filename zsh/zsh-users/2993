Zsh's idea of word separators is defined by the WORDCHARS parameter. It
actually defines characters to be considered part of a word as opposed
to separators. You can remove slash from it:

WORDCHARS="${WORDCHARS:s@/@}"

Personally, I only want slash to be considered a word separator for
moving and deleting words backward and forward - not for other things
like copying the last word so I define my own functions for these which
all look something like this:

tcsh-backward-word() {
  local WORDCHARS="${WORDCHARS:s@/@}"
  zle backward-word
}

Then I can do:
zle -N tcsh-backward-word
bindkey "..." tcsh-backword-word
