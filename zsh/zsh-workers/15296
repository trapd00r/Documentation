This usually means something's wrong with the way `struct dirent' or the
equivalent is being interpreted when zsh is reading file names from a
directory.  I've seen this happen on Solaris because both SysV and BSD
style directory routines are available and you can get the wrong one
depending on which C compiler is first in your $PATH, but I'm surprised
it's happened on OpenBSD.

What does

    grep DIR config.h

show you?
