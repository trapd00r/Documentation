I usually don't put changelog entries for work that I do unless it
makes a big user visible change.  I've been spending some time
reorganizing some of the code and this usually doesn't warrant a
changelog entry (since the functionality is the same).

Also there is a bug I added in test2 that I fixed in test5.  In test2,
in certain situations, the environment variables HOME and PWD are not
initialized correctly.  I didn't put an entry for this in the changelog
since the bug was not in beta8.  Because of this, I would recommend
rebuilding if you are using test2.

Also I've done some other small things such as adding the new BUGS files,
the new FAQ, a new META-FAQ, updated the compctl-examples, and a made a
few other changes of this nature.

I admit it's not a huge difference from test2.  Everybody doesn't have
to build every test release I make.  I'm just trying to make the
latest snapshots available to people who are interested.
