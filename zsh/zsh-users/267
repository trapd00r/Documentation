I've got a problem with something I am guessing is a 'feature'  
which I am using incorrectly.  I am 90% sure there is a setopt which  
controls this, but I don't know what it is...

When I try to do an 'ls' on a file which doesn't exist, it shows  
the contents of the current directory.

I would prefer it to say 'no such file' or some such.

Can this be done?

Thanks

TjL
