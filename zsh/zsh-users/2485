Subject: compctl for export
X-Mailer: VM 6.73 under 20.4 "Emerald" XEmacs  Lucid


Hi,

I'm using the following setup for completion on 'export':

  # for export, complete environment variables before the equal (=) sign, normal
  # file system completion afterwards 
  compctl -E -S '=' -x 'n[1,=]' -f -- export

If I wanted to extend MANPATH, for example, I could get completion on
MANPATH before the equal sign, then $MANPATH after the equals and
continue with some path specification afterwards.  This worked under
zsh-3.1.4.

Under 3.1.6, however, adding a $ after the equals sign and asking for
a completion erases _everything_ after 'export'.  Not quite the
behavior I wanted.  

Does anyone have suggestions on how to cure this ill or pointers to
relevant documentation for me?

Thanks!
