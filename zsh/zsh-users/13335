Hi -

I have created the following function in zsh on Mac OSX:

cd() {
    builtin cd "$@" print -D $PWD
}

This works find on OSX, but gives the following error on Fedora Core 8:

johann:czechar:.zfunc> cd /home/czechar
cd /home/czechar
cd:cd:1: too many arguments

I am running zsh 4.2.6 on Fedora.

Any notion what the problem could be?

Thanks

Corwin
