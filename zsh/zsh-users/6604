Easiest way is probably to use:
  _values -s , 'attribute id' $(slptool findattrs ...)

Otherwise, you can use:

local -a suf
compset -P '*,'
compset -S ',*' || suf=( -S , )
compadd ... "$suf[@]" ...

That'll make it ignore anything before the cursor up the last comma
(and the same in reverse for after the cursor).

That's harder. _sep_parts or _multi_parts might help you. Otherwise, you
need to start using compadd -O and it gets complicated.
