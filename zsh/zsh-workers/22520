We just installed a spanking-new Opteron machine with CentOS 4.3 for
the x86_64 architecture on it.  This is equivalent to RedHat EL4u3 and
comes with zsh-4.2.0 as a precompiled RPM.

The first thing I did was install my cvs-controlled zsh environment and
log out and back in.  I get:

/home/schaefer/.zsh/.zlogin:unlimit:29: no such resource: cputime

The "ulimit" (as opposed to uNlimit) command works fine, but the "limit"
command has nothing.

It'll be a while before I get a chance to attempt recompiling zsh on this
machine.  Has anyone else seen this problem?  How can it even occur?
