4.3.2 built without a hitch on my linux box this morning, but I received
one failure during "make test" on hp:

% uname -s -r -v -m -i -l
HP-UX B.11.11 U 9000/800 139414660 unlimited-user license
# I have to use "sh" on the next line; when I use zsh-4.2.0 for the
# configure, the "make" fails. :-(  Details upon request, though I doubt
# anyone cares about 4.2.0 anymore.
% sh configure --prefix=$HOME --bindir=$HOME/bin.$OSREV \
    --libdir=$HOME/lib/$OSREV
[...]
% make test
[...]
./D02glob.ztst: starting.
