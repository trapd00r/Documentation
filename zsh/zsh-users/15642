} while in vim `dl' will delete the character under the curosr,
} zsh in vicmd mapping will delete only left to the cursor,
} how do i change it?

Hmm.  I just did:

schaefer<547> bindkey -v

followed by ESC to enter vicmd mode, k to recall the line, hhhhhh to
place the cursor over the "d", and then dl to delete, and I get:

schaefer<548> binkey -v

which certainly appears to have deleted the character under the
cursor.  So zsh is attempting to do the right thing.

The only place I can get it to fail is on the "v".  When the motion
for vi-forward-char can't be performed because we're at the end of
the buffer, the deletion can't be performed either.
