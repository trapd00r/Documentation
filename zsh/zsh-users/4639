This looks like FreeBSD.

When I tab for cd into "/usr/ports/x11" I get prompted with:
x11/           x11-fm/        x11-servers/   x11-wm/
x11-clocks/    x11-fonts/     x11-toolkits/

and I see:
% print -l /usr/ports/x11-*/bb*
/usr/ports/x11-clocks/bbdate
/usr/ports/x11-wm/bbkeys
/usr/ports/x11-wm/bbpager

So what completion do you have set up for cd?  A form which will
backtrack to try and handle spelling mistakes?
