} Yes or course.  That's quite similar to the old behaviour.

OK, that's very good; but I think the documentation of this is a bit
misleading.  E.g. from the FAQ:

! Traps defined by the trap builtin are now executed in the current shell
! environment and not as a shell function.  This means that $1 is not set
! to the signal number.  Of course the TRAPxxx functions continue working
! as before.

This sounds as though TRAPFOO() continues to fire ("functions continue
working") even after `trap bar foo`; sort of as if TRAPxxx() and "trap"
are now in completely separate "namespaces".
