building on alpha-dec-osf4.0 with gcc 2.8.1 (not that it gets that far :)

when configure goes to create the files :

2 goaway/2:a2 303 % ./config.status
creating Makefile
sed: Cannot find or open file :Makefile.in.
creating Doc/Makefile
sed: Cannot find or open file :Doc/Makefile.in.
creating Etc/Makefile
sed: Cannot find or open file :Etc/Makefile.in.
creating Src/Makefile
sed: Cannot find or open file :Src/Makefile.in.
creating config.h
cat: :config.h.in: No such file or directory
config.h is unchanged

the sed in question is the ordinary one from DU 4.0B.

changing my path so it uses GNU sed 2.05 doesn't help any...

has this happened to anyone else ? the zefram4 release didn't have this
problem...

Thanks,
 Andrew
