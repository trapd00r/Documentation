If I had thought of it, I probably would have done that.

Nowadays I'm a bit reluctant to change that because I've too often
thought about removing menu-select -- after all, it's just
menu-complete with enforcing selection, which can be achieved by other 
means.

And there is the question if menu-select should be re-bound to
_main_complete when compdef finds a widget using menu-select.
