====================

i'm using it in a prompt <http://smasher.org/zsh/>, so i'm partial towards 
the more intuitive %Z form. in any case, i re-did it so it's only showing 
the part after the slash... ie; on some systems it will "EST" and on some 
systems it will show "New_York", but it won't show "America/New_York" 
which just takes up too much space in the prompt.
