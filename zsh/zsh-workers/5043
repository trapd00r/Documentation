:There's no way to do it that I can determine with a stock qmail/ezmlm(idx)
:installation.  You can do it with a minor, non-intrusive change to
:ezmlm-idx and several possibly non-trivial setup changes (from an admin
:POV there would be 5 lists, not 3, but users would only see 3)

Another alternative would be to have 
    zsh-{announce,users,workers}@zsh.org (or @lists.zsh.org ?)
or maybe just {announce,users,workers}@....
which can add an appropriate header containing sequence numbers for
{users,workers} but not for announce (which won't get a sequence
number until after moderation).  However, those sequence numbers for
{users,workers} would be different to whatever number is in the
mail's ``Return-Path:'' so people wouldn't be able to fetch from
the sunsite.auc.dk archive by that number.  Only from the www.zsh.org
archive.
