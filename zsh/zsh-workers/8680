Usually, my script adds new files automatically.  So I don't need such
notices.  However, file removing/moving/reverting requires some manual
work and sometimes I forget them...

In reality, I have a directory which contains latest zsh and is *not*
maintained by cvs.  The directory is updated by patches from
zsh-workers and zsh-users and the repository is updated by `cvs
import' for each patch.  So, new files are automatically appeared on
main trunc when a patch create these files.  When some files are
removed, `cvs rm' is needed.  When some files are moved, these files
must be moved manually and `cvs import' is needed.  Sometimes I omit
the `cvs import' because it'll be executed with next patch, though.
When some files are reverted, `cvs add' and `cvs admin -b1.1.1' is
needed.
