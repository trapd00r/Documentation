I was a bit pessimistic here.  The file Misc/compctl-examples in the
distribution has the following.  The 's[if=]' is of general applicability
for the old extended complete (after -x).

#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# dd
compctl -k '(if of conv ibs obs bs cbs files skip file seek count)' \
	-S '=' -x 's[if=], s[of=]' -f - 'C[0,conv=*,*] n[-1,,], s[conv=]' \
	-k '(ascii ebcdic ibm block unblock lcase ucase swap noerror sync)' \
	-q -S ',' - 'n[-1,=]' -X '<number>'  -- dd
