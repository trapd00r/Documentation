Probably not high on anyone's list, but this:

compctl -D -f -x 's[:]' -U -K multicomp

(using the multicomp function from Functions/Compctl) used to work like so:

zsh-2.4% echo :/u/b<TAB>
zsh-2.4% echo /usr/bin 

Note that the leading colon got stripped.  This is an intentional trick to
invoke multicomp only if a "flag character" has been inserted at the front
of the completion, because otherwise multicomp could be slow/expensive to
invoke on every default file completion.

In 4.3.5-dev-0 (current CVS) it almost works, except it fails to remove the
leading colon:

schaefer[632] Src/zsh -f
torch% FPATH=../zsh-4.3/Functions/Compctl autoload +X multicomp
torch% compctl -D -f -x 's[:]' -U -K multicomp
torch% echo :/u/b<TAB>
torch% echo :/usr/bin 

Something has changed about the -U option and its handling of prefixes, I
guess ...?
