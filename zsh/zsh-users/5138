I did not intend to offend anybody just pointed out that blocking mail
just because it is in MIME makes little sense.

I do not like spam here as well but the problem with any mail blocking
is you end up blocking legitimate mail. More than once my posts to other
lists were rejected because mail software found them offending for
whatever reason.

Besides this mail list is run by external authority and in the past we
had problems contacting maintainers.
