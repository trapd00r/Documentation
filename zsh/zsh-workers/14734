Patches should be posted for the development branch only, IMO.  It's not
a problem to post both as long as they're labeled appropriately, but the
development version is called that for a reason ...

} HEAD as before?

The second of those would be preferable, I think, though there's no way
we can actually prevent anyone who has commit access from doing the first.
