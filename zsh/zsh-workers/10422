The notify option makes zsh report background process events
immediately.  Is there a similar option for watch?  In other words, is
there a way to make zsh immediately report when a watched user changes
status?  If not, are there plans to include this functionality?  (I have a
friend that wants to switch back to tcsh because of this.)  Thanks.
