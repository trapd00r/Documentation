You don't need to do this.  *ALL* zsh-users messages are forwarded to
the zsh-workers list; you can't be on zsh-workers without receiving
the mail from zsh-users.  They just aren't archived with zsh-workers.

Except now it's archived three times.  Mailing lists are not always
instantaneous, especially on month boundaries when the servers may be
doing housekeeping.
