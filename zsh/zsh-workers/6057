This seems to be due to the lines

	    if (lpromptw == 0)
		zputs("\n", shout);	/* works with both hasam and !hasam */

which occur a couple of times in zle_refresh.c.  I don't know why they're
there, so I don't know how to alter them.  Maybe the test needs to be
something like if (lpromptw == 0 && lprompth == 1) ?
