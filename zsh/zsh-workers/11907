Sorry to report that I started seeing new uninitialized memory reads
during completion.  Now at different location.
        match_str      [compmatch.c:806]
        match_str      [compmatch.c:598]
        match_str      [compmatch.c:598]
        addmatches     [compcore.c:1801]
        bin_compadd    [complete.c:606]
        ---------------------------------
        match_str      [compmatch.c:806]
        match_str      [compmatch.c:598]
        addmatches     [compcore.c:1801]
        bin_compadd    [complete.c:606]

Though these seem to be more difficult to trip over.

The recent changes to the trap code have fixed the memory leaks
reported in 11766, and no new errors.

Sven, thanks for the stat optimizations to _path_files.  It seems faster.
Plus, file completion works nicely with Clearcase now.  (Though... the
additional change you were suggesting in workers/9631 for a "style that
gives a pattern to match pathname components that should be accepted
immediately" would make it work even better... :) )

-FR.
