What happens if you start with "zsh -f" so that we're not dealing with
any possible oddities from /etc/z* or ~/.z* files?

[hanno: /home/hanno]> zsh -f
yourhost% bindkey -v
yourhost% autoload -U compinit
yourhost% compinit -D
yourhost% cd /us<TAB>

(Your local machine name should appear instead of "yourhost" above,
and <TAB> means press the tab key.)

Does anything not shown there happen at any step along the way?  Is
the completion still garbled?

There should be one more colon in there, it's  [[:cntrl:]]  but that
still might not work if you don't have a very modern sed.  Also the
"$" at the end of the pattern is a typo, too, that grep won't match
anything.  A more useful approach might be

    env | egrep '^(TERM|VISUAL|EDITOR|PS1)' | cat -v

} I cannot delete the "cd /us"
} Strange hmm?

I'm beginning to think we're entirely on the wrong track here and this
is just a problem with invisible characters in your prompt string.
Thus suggesting that you start from "zsh -f" (which is always a good
technique, to make sure that the problem isn't something that you have
misconfigured locally).
