Yes, you are right!  It was a dumb user malfunction on my part. I
tested today running zsh with "-f" so it would not run the rc scripts
and it worked properly.  I had forgotten that I was using $r and $y in
my zshrc script and then unsetting them before exiting.  I don't know
why I did not think to check that last night.  I think part of my
brain had already gone to sleep before I was ready to stop working for
the night.

Thanks for the response.
