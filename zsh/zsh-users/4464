I entirely agree. Sometimes, this is worse, as things in /etc/zshrc
override the user's settings in his ~/.zshenv! For instance, in
SuSE 7.2, /etc/profile is sourced in /etc/zshrc, and this overrides
the path the user has set in his zshenv. Really annoying...

Or perhaps zsh's default should be not to source the system files,
perhaps except /etc/zshenv?
