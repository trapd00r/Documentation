Howdy-
  I just wanted to de-lurk for a moment to say publically that I'm one
  of those people who uses your zsh port on NT and I am *really,
  really* grateful for all of the time you've put in so far to make it
  work. I'm sure I'm not alone in this appreciation.

  Comprehensive documentation is great, but it doesn't do command
  completion for me under NT nearly as well as your zsh binary
  does. Thanks again for the port (and to everyone else that has
  worked hard to make zsh the uber-shell it is today).
  
     Respectfully,

P.S. Now if I could only get a decent console window under NT that can
do scrollback and reasonable cut and paste....
