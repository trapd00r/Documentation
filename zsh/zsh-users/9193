 I would like to know how to turn off the strict globbing feature in zsh. In bash, if a globbing fails, the shell will simply pass the full string - metacharacters and all - directly to the program. But zsh bails out when globbing fails. So currenlty I have to include all of them in single quotes to make it work.

 IS there a config option which can get back the bash like behaviour?

 Thanks in advance.
