Sorry, I should have read the man page in better detail before
posting this question. The solution is of course

   ${(e)z}

But now comes another twist to this problem: I found that I *also*
would like to have the resulting string to undergo tilde-expansion,
which is of course a completely different story.

That is, if I have an assignment

  x=3D'~linus    ~steve'

Is there also a simple solution, which expands $x to the home
directories
of linus and steve, with spacing preserved?
