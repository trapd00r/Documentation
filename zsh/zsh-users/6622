Subject: list keys in assoc array.

I've been poking through the man pages, and I can't find how to get a list
of keys from an associative array.  Idealy, I'd like something like:

foreach key in array ; do
   if [ array[key] = someval ] ; then
      do stuff
   fi
done

Am I just being blind in the manpages?

Thanks;
Jason
