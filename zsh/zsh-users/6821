Hmm, you shouldn't need nohup to run from cron.  I've been doing this for
over two years without problems with something like the following script
and have it email the results to me.

#!/bin/sh
cd /my/zsh/path
make realclean || true
CVS_RSH=ssh /usr/bin/cvs update -dP
Util/preconfig
./configure  '--enable-cflags=-O2 -Wall -g' --enable-zsh-debug --enable-zsh-mem --enable-zsh-mem-debug --enable-zsh-mem-warning --enable-zsh-secure-free --enable-zsh-hash-debug
make
