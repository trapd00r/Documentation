Not really.  I suspect there are features introduced in zsh years ago
that I've never learned how to use.  Indeed, I print out and read the
manual every few months, on average, and find half a dozen useful
features I'd never noticed before.  Maybe it would be a good idea to
construct some regression tests?

In this specific case, although I use ** every day, I never use ***.
