It's possible this is related to a weird bug with NIS I've been noticing
on Solaris for a long time now; one particular user's home directory is
scrambled if I refer to ~rwy under some set of conditions.  So their may
be something weird in the network database lookup.

We had a patch recently to remove explicit lookup of NIS etc., since
modern libraries will do it automatically.  Unfortunately it doesn't
test for systems where this is the right thing to do, so we can't
incorporate it just like that.
