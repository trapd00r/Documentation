} zsh won't parse function definitions with a space between the parentheses:

It will if you `setopt SH_GLOB'.  The POSIX rules conflict with zsh's own
globbing rules.  There are a number of options one has to set before the
shell will closely emulate POSIX; the easiest way to get them all is to
use the `emulate sh' command.
