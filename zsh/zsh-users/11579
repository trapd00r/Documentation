The patch to _complete_help below allows you to tweak the completions as
follows:

  zle -C all-matches complete-word _complete_help
  zstyle ':completion:*' help-function _generic

Then ^xa calls _complete_help which calls _generic with the context
including all-matches.  As _generic hasn't been called at that point,
unfortunately we need a very general context for help-function, so you
need to alter the style to get this to work and then change it back or
delete it, and you need to change the definition of all-matches, too.  I
won't commit this because I've a feeling there ought to be a better way
of doing it, in particular a simple way of making it work for generic
widgets with a single keystroke.

Anyway, it gives you the following (I've wrapped some long lines):


tags in context :completion:all-matches:complete:cvs::
    argument-rest  (_arguments _cvs)
tags in context :completion:all-matches:complete:cvs-commit::
    argument-rest options  (_arguments _cvs_commit _call_function
      _cvs_command _arguments _cvs)
tags in context :completion:all-matches:complete:cvs-commit:argument-rest:
    directories existing-files removed-files  (_alternative
      _cvs_files_modified _arguments _cvs_commit _call_function
      _cvs_command _arguments _cvs) 
    directories                               (_cvs_existing_directories
      _alternative _cvs_files_modified _arguments _cvs_commit
      _call_function _cvs_command _arguments _cvs) 
    files                                     (_cvs_existing_entries
      _cvs_modified_entries _alternative _cvs_files_modified _arguments
      _cvs_commit _call_function _cvs_command _arguments _cvs) 
    files                                     (_cvs_nonexistent_entries
      _alternative _cvs_files_modified _arguments _cvs_commit
      _call_function _cvs_command _arguments _cvs)


This suggests the context is being processed OK and hence tag-order
ought to pick it up.  Did you remember the ":complete:" chunk of the
context?
