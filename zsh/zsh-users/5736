What about it (quoting OpenSSH):

     $HOME/.ssh/environment
             This file is read into the environment at login (if it =
exists).
             It can only contain empty lines, comment lines (that start =
with
             `#'), and assignment lines of the form name=3Dvalue.  The =
file
             should be writable only by the user; it need not be =
readable by
             anyone else.
