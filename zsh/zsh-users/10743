Subject: error in 19.3.1
Message-ID: <20060919222852.GA46327@dagan.sigpipe.cz>

This is near the end of 19.3.1:

For example:

zstyle -e ':completion:*' completer '
    if [[ $words[1] = cvs ]]; then
      reply=(_complete)
    else
      reply=(_complete _approximate)
    fi'

uses the value `_complete' for the completer style in most contexts, but
the value `_complete _approximate' when the first word on the command
line is `cvs'.
