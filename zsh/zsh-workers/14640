Sorry, that I bother you zsh-gurus, but just for completeness: I found
that the "configure"-wrapper-script I use set also

 export CFLAGS="$CFLAGS -I/usr/local/contrib/include"
 export LDFLAGS="$LDFLAGS -L/usr/local/contrib/lib"

so that seems to force the use of /usr/local/contrib/include/curses.h
instead of /usr/include/curses.h (I had til now the wrong (?) idea that
that line would only force an addrtional search for header files in the
given directory that aren't found in the "standard" include-directories).

Greetings

Jens
