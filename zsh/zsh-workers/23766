Although I haven't followed them in great detail, there have been
previous discussions about ways of saving and restoring the directory
stack between (consecutive rather than concurrent) sessions which
would be a starting point.

This sort of question comes up often enough it would be a good
idea to have some suitable code bundled with the shell.
