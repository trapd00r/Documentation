<H1 ID="S8"><SPAN CLASS="chapnum">8</SPAN> Options</H1>
<H2 ID="S8.1">General</H2>
<P>The VT102 uses only one internally installed option, the 20 mA current
loop option (VT1XX-CA). This chapter describes the option, its installation,
and checkout. See <A HREF="chapter10.html">Chapter 10</A> for ordering information.</P>
<H2 ID="S8.2">20 mA Current Loop Interface Option <SPAN CLASS="notoc">(VT1XX-CA)</SPAN></H2>
<P>This optional interface connects the terminal to a computer. The 20 mA
option consists of a board and interface connector. When this option is
installed, you must set the modem control SET-UP feature to FDX A (full-duplex
with no modem control). The internal communication switches are
not used with the 20 mA option. <A TITLE="20 mA Connector and Pin Assignments" HREF="figure8-1.html">Figure 8-1</A> shows the 20 mA current loop
interface connector and pin assignments.</P>
<P CLASS="note">NOTE: The terminal uses either the 20 mA or standard modem interface.
If you use the standard modem interface with the 20 mA option, unplug
the cable connecting the option to the terminal controller board.</P>
<H2 ID="S8.3">Option Installation</H2>
<P>Install the option by using the following procedure (<A TITLE="20 mA Connector and Pin Assignments" HREF="figure8-1.html">Figure 8-1</A>).</P>
<OL>
<LI>Turn the power switch off (0) and unplug power cord.</LI>
<LI>Unplug keyboard, communication, printer, and composite video output
cables.</LI>
<LI>Loosen the two captive screws holding the access cover in place
(<A TITLE="Access Cover Screw Locations" HREF="figure8-2.html">Figure 8-2</A>).</LI>
<LI>Pull the access cover straight out from the back of the terminal, until
loose. Then move the cover to the left, off the supporting studs. Finally,
remove the access cover by pulling straight out (<A TITLE="Access Cover Removal" HREF="figure8-3.html">Figure 8-3</A>).</LI>
<LI>Install the 20 mA option board in the access cover by using the three
Phillips head screws provided (<A TITLE="20 mA Board Installation" HREF="figure8-4.html">Figure 8-4</A>).</LI>
<LI>Install the 20 mA connector to the bottom of the access cover by using
the two spacers and two hex head screws provided.</LI>
<LI>Install the 20 mA loopback connector around a spacer holding the 20
mA connector to the access cover. This prevents the loss of the
loopback connector.</LI>
<LI>Set the 20 mA transmit (TRANS) and receive (REC) switches to the
proper configuration (<A TITLE="20 mA Board Configuration" HREF="figure8-5.html">Figure 8-5</A>).
<P>The switches determine if the transmitter and receiver of the 20 mA
interface are active or normal (passive). Usually, the switches are
set for normal (passive) operation. Passive means the terminal does
not supply the 20 mA current used when communicating. Active
means the terminal supplies the 20 mA current when communicating.</P>
<P CLASS="note">NOTE: You must set these switches for normal (passive) operation
to perform the loopback self-test. The test verifies operation of the
20 mA option after installation.</P></LI>
<LI>Connect the adapter cable provided with the option to the 20 mA
board. Place the access cover next to its opening in the back of the
terminal. Connect the other end of the adapter cable to the connector
on the terminal controller board.</LI>
<LI>Hold the access cover straight up and move it to the right side of the
terminal opening. Push the access cover into the opening and feel
for the studs on the right in the terminal. Push the access cover onto
the studs until the cover is in place. <A TITLE="Access Cover Removal" HREF="figure8-3.html">Figure 8-3</A> shows how the access
cover fits on the studs.</LI>
<LI>Tighten the two captive screws that hold the access cover in place
(<A TITLE="Access Cover Screw Locations" HREF="figure8-2.html">Figure 8-2</A>).
<P CLASS="note">CAUTION: You may damage the access cover by tightening the
captive screws too much.</P></LI>
<LI>Perform the following option checkout procedure.</LI>
</OL>
<H2 ID="S8.4">Option Checkout</H2>
<P>The data loopback test verifies the 20 mA current loop option can transmit
and receive characters. Characters transmitted during the test pass
through the loopback connector back to the terminal. The test checks
these characters to verify the option's operation. Perform the data loopback
self-test by using the following procedure.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Turn the power switch off (0) and unplug the power cord (<A TITLE="20 mA Connector and Pin Assignments" HREF="figure8-1.html">Figure 8-1</A>).</LI>
<LI>Unplug the communication cable.</LI>
<LI>Install the 20 mA loopback connector (DIGITAL PN 70-15503-00)
supplied with the option (<A TITLE="20 mA Loopback Connector" HREF="figure8-6.html">Figure 8-6</A>).</LI>
<LI>Remove the access cover and set the 20 mA TRANS and REC
switches by using the following procedure.
<P CLASS="note">NOTE: Remove the access cover only if the TRANS and REC
switches are not set to normal.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Unplug the keyboard, printer, and composite video output cables.</LI>
<LI>Loosen the two captive screws holding the access cover in place
(<A TITLE="Access Cover Screw Locations" HREF="figure8-2.html">Figure 8-2</A>).</LI>
<LI>Pull the access cover straight out the back of the terminal, until
loose. Then, move the cover to the left, off the supporting studs.
Finally, remove the access cover by pulling straight out (<A TITLE="Access Cover Removal" HREF="figure8-3.html">Figure 8-3</A>).
<P CLASS="note">CAUTION: You may damage the access cover by tightening the
captive screws too much.</P></LI>
<LI>Connect the keyboard cable.</LI>
</OL></LI>
<LI>Turn the power switch on (1). The terminal performs the power-up
self-test.</LI>
<LI>Enter SET-UP and select:
<UL>
<LI>Off-line (Transmit and receive speeds do not have to be the same).</LI>
<LI>ANSI/VT52 SET-UP feature to ANSI (SET-UP B switch 2-3 = 1)</LI>
<LI>Modem control SET-UP feature to FDX A.</LI>
</UL></LI>
<LI>Start the data loopback self-test by using one of the following sequences.
<TABLE>

<P>The single test displays the wait message while running. The test
ends with the following indications.</P>
<UL>
<LI>The wait message is erased.</LI>
<LI>ON LINE or OFF LINE turns on.</LI>
<LI>The cursor appears in the upper-left corner of the screen.</LI>
</UL>
<P>The continuous test also displays the wait messages while running.
The test ends only when it finds an error or power is turned off.</P>
<P>When either test finds an error, the terminal displays an error code.
An error means the option is not operating correctly. Call your local
Digital Field Service Office for assistance.</P></LI>
<LI>Turn the power switch off (0) and remove the loopback connector.</LI>
<LI>If you set the TRANS and REC switches in step 4, select the correct
switch settings.</LI>
<LI>Connect the communications, printer, and video output cables.</LI>
