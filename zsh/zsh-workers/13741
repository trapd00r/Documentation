} Something like this.

That, and/or a flat file of URLs rather than a directory structure.  Hmm,
we could have the following styles for the `urls' tag:

	file	-- flat file containing URLs to complete (new?)
	local	-- prefixes for completing local URLs (exists now)
	path	-- location of directory tree mapping URLs (exists)
	urls	-- array of URLs to complete (new?)

I'm not sure about the names "file" and "path", but ...

} I don't know if it's going to be a problem with it always taking
} precedence, however; one of these simple ones can then mask any of the
} other sort if you just type a fairly generic prefix.

I don't think that's a problem because the tag is always `urls'; they'd
just be in different groups.  Am I confused?

} (Does anyone else use _next_tags?)

I have, but rarely.
