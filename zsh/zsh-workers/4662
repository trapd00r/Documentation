Unrelated parameters fix: the only thing I don't understand is how it
got into 3.1.5 in the first place, which usually means it was my
fault.  It didn't show up in base 3.1.5 because the `if (locallevel)'
bit wasn't there, so the shell never tried to delete any parameters;
now it deletes things it shouldn't (I found this via a warning from
mem.c).  This patch is against the latest version of the associative
array story, but the effect of it is necessary (though lower priority)
anyway: just replacing the offending line by hand will work.
