Subject: Problem running zsh on WinNT 4.0

Hello all,

I have just recently installed the zsh program on my WinNT 4.0.  It runs
just fine, but each time it starts up, it does not source my profile file.
I always have to source in the my profile manaually(. ./profile.zsh).  Is
there some way were I have my profile sourced in when I start the program?

Any comments or ideas regarding this delimma is greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Timothy
