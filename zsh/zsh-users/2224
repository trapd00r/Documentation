	has anyone here tried to compile zsh under interix, and if
so, is there anything i should watch out for?  for those who aren't 
familiar with interix, it is a full posix-compliant unix subsystem
that runs on top of the windows nt kernel, in much the same way that
the windows nt subsystem does.  it only comes with ksh and csh,
unfortunately, but i just got their developer kit, which adds gcc,
make, etc., and am thinking about trying to build zsh.
