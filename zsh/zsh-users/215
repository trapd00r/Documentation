Hello,
I have just encountered a problem where I have no idea where it comes from

Invoking perl5.002 with debugger support as

perl -de 0

works fine under ZSH 2.6-beta16 and under the bourne shell
BUT gives a segment violation under 2.6-beta17.

Thank you for any hints,
Helmut Jarausch.


Here some details (System  SGI IRIX6.1)


1 % perl -de 0
Stack dump during die enabled outside of evals.

Loading DB routines from perl5db.pl patch level 0.94
Emacs support available.

Enter h or `h h' for help.
