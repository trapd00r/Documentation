Official CVS repository for autoconf is

http://sourceware.cygnus.com/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/autoconf/?cvsroot=autoconf

They may have development tags. At least ntpd comes with pre-release version
of CVS (2.14a if I'm not mistaken). This version recognizes alphaev6.

I believe, Ben Elliston (mailto:bje@cygnus.com) is source keeper.
