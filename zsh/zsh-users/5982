Hi,

I'm a subscriber, no need to send the mail twice.

$ZSH_VERSION is 4.0.4

'n -\t' definitely looks like Netcat.

I now see what could be the problem (but have no solution): Debian
renames the client to nedit-nc, which completes as expected. However,
I always roll my own NEdits, and these are called 'nc' (and aliased to
'n').

I now looked around a bit (never expected that NEdit is supported
(should have remembered that you are using it)) and found
.../Completion/X/_nedit, which is Greek to me. What could I do to get
the completion I want, if I don't care what happens to Netcat?


Thanks in advance!

Thorsten
