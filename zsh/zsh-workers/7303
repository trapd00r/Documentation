Subject: Numeric range bug
Date: Wed, 28 Jul 1999 14:25:02 +0200
From: Peter Stephenson <pws@ibmth.df.unipi.it>

Just discovered this.  It will have to wait to be fixed --- it's been
around for years and no-one's complained.  I'm planning a rewrite of the
pattern matching code anyway.

 such patterns unchanged if they do not match regardless of the state of
 the nonomatch and nullglob options.
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
+Numeric ranges are still too greedy with using characters; for example,
+<1-1000>33 will not match 633 because the 633 matches the range.  Some
+backtracking will be necessary.
