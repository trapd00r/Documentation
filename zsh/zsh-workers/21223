You don't have yodl, right?  Configure hasn't detected it so it's put a
": " in front.  This should mean it runs through OK, but without
generating the documentation, although it will produce an empty file.
It's not obvious why it gave an error --- unless the wrap between "$t"
and "arget" was there in the original, which is unlikely.
