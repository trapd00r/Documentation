I just tested in C (printf) and it does it this way too,
printf ("%04d %04d", -5, 5);
-005 0005

as does zsh's printf
% printf '%04d %04d' -5 5
-005 0005

Well, I don't think a feature only available by an option that does
something completely different can really be said to be reliable, but
I'll let someone else decide, if they even care. I could in any case
limit the nobraceccl case to disallow it.
