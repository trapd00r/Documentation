I am not sure, that compinstall can take in account all possible
configurations. In case of NFS mounted HOME (probably, the most common
case) - I always used ``~/...'' - that should be portable even if HOME
changes.

Ehh ... but at this point _ci_fdir is an absolute path ... and starts with
``/'' ... so _ci_f is set to some directory in HOME instead to _ci_fdir, is
not it?
