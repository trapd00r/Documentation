I have put the fully made documentation for 3.1.5-pws-3 --- nroff,
texinfo and info --- at

http://www.ifh.de/~pws/computing/zsh-3.1.5-pws-3.doc.tar.gz

You can untar it where you untarr'd the source file and it should all
go into the right place.  If you have yodl etc. you don't need this.
It's more than half the size of the source archive.

Included is a small fix for the zftp docs, as below.  Mainly this was
because makeinfo pointed out the `previous' pointer from mod_zftp.yo
was wrong.
