glob.c is quite independent of the rest of the code, I think it would not
be hard to make it a standalone library.

ansi2knr is only needed for very old traditional compilers which cannot
compile programs with ANSI C prototypes.  Makepro is just a simple
prototype generator.

There are several static variables used by glob.c, so if you want real
re-entrant glob, more changes are necessary.

The scanner in zsh glob can be used for perl, however the pattern
matching part has some problems.  One for example is that (ab#)# does not
match ab.  For perl, a zsh glob -> regexp translator would be much more
roboust and relyable.
