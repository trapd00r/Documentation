Bang to rights... I think the following simplified version works,
although I don't really know why it was so complicated in the first
place, so please say if this has side effects.

I think there may be a similar problem when checking for modified files,
but as the test is currently

    [[ -n ${pat::="${(@j:|:)${(@)${(@)${(@)${(@)${(@)${(@M)${(@f)"$(<"$realdir"CVS/Entries)"}:#/*}#/}/${slash}[^${slash}]#${slash}//}%/[^/]#/[^/]#}:#${(j:|:)~${${${${(f)"$(LC_ALL=C builtin stat -gn +mtime -F '%a %b %e %T %Y' ${realdir}*(D) 2>/dev/null)"}##*/}/ //}//(#m)[][*?()<|^~#\\]/\\$MATCH}}}%%/*}//(#m)[][*?()<|^~#\\]/\\$MATCH}"} ]] &&
    _wanted files expl 'modified file' _path_files -g "$pat"

I don't feel like investigating more closely at the moment.  (Is that
the World's Longest Ever Shell Substitution?)
