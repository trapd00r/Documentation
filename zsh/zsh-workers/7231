Subject: README changes for 3.1.6
Date: Wed, 21 Jul 1999 10:50:20 +0200
From: Peter Stephenson <pws@ibmth.df.unipi.it>

This is what I'm planning to do with the main README file for the 3.1.6
release.

It's currently a bit premature to mention 3.0.6 as the last stable release,
although it's pretty certain to be so for most of the life of 3.1.6.  Maybe
we can still arrange to release the versions together.

Also note the list of possible incompatibilities with the previous release.
There are only three fairly small ones.  Maybe other people have
encountered more of these?

I also realised Zoli and Zefram were gradually being edited out of
Etc/CONTRIBUTORS --- that's partly because 3.1.x, as a beta version, hasn't
had so much stuff on maintainers and contributors in.  It's a bit late to
do this properly for 3.1.1-3.1.5, unfortunately, so I've just stuck a short
note in.  But it could really do with some going through the Changelog to
note things like complete rewrites of the editor and the dynamic loading
system, for example.  I don't suppose anybody's going to volunteer for
that.

+---------------------------
+
+If you have been using recent versions of zsh 3.1, the following changes in
+the shell may affect you:
+- The traditional bindings of \M-n (history-search-backward) and
+  \M-p (history-search-forward) in older versions of zsh have returned,
+  as has the traditional behaviour of those functions and the functions
+  up-line-or-search and down-line-or-search.  In 3.1.5, the functions
+  behaved differently and \M-n and \M-p were bound by default to
+  history-beginning-search-backward and history-beginning-search-forward.
+- Prompt truncation behaviour via %<...< and %>...> (or %[<...] etc.) has
+  changed slightly:  the string to be truncated runs to the end of the
+  prompt or to the next truncation sequence; %<< will turn off truncation.
+  Previously it only covered individual prompt escapes.  So for example the
+  prompt `%10<...<%~%% ' will now include the `%% ' in the string to be
+  truncated, and you should change the prompt to `%10<...<%~%<<%% ' to turn
+  off truncation immediately after the `%~'.
+- If for some reason you have `setopt norcs' or `unsetopt rcs' anywhere in
+  your startup files (e.g. to stop .zlogout being run), this will now
+  take effect immediately, preventing later startup files from being
+  run.  It is safe to put `setopt norcs' in .zlogin as this is always
+  the last run.
+
+See the FAQ for a discussion of changes over the longer term.
