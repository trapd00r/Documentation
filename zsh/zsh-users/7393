Hi,

This must be an old zsh chestnut EXCEPT I couldn't Google a solution

I want to do a

> ls -l *.{cfm,htm,html}

Which I could also do in bash.

In my cygwin-zsh 4.2.0 this works fine UNLESS one of the file
extensions is ABSENT, when instead of list the remaining file types it
gives an error message.

>\ls -t *.{html,cfm,htm}
zsh: no matches found: *.htm
