Dear Zsh Users,
	Does anyone know of a simple way to get the format of the time report
to print in HH:MM:SS format? I have read the zshparam.1 man page and don't
see such an option. The closest thing to it is %E, the elapsed user time in 
seconds. However, seeing  "3600.12" seconds is not as user friendly as
"1:00:00.12". Thanks. :-)
