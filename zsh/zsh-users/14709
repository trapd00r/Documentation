 Thanks for testing this but it doesn't work for me even with "zsh -f". If
I run a new shell with "-f" it works initially but as soon as I do
"autoload -U compinit; compinit" it doesn't work any longer.

 I built zsh using "--enable-pcre --enable-multibyte" under Cygwin 1.7.1.
Should I have used different configure options? Or maybe it's 1.7-specific?
Would you have any hints about how could I debug this further?

 Thanks,
VZ
