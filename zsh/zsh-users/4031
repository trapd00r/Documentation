I don't think we should.  If we would, running
         % ls.exe
would no longer work.  (Bad example - nobody would try this for ls, they 
might for other (Windows) executables.  For instance, I could imagine 
typing "cmd.exe".)

The way things are done now seem to be the same as for Bash (which is, 
after all, the Official Cygwin Shell).  Also in Bash, ls<TAB> is completed 
to both "ls" and "ls.exe", and /bin/ls<TAB> is only completed to "/bin/ls.exe".
I think this is the best we can do, without hacking the completion system 
itself.

I don't see why that would be a problem.
