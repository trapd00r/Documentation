Eh? I'm confused. _nslookup doesn't require any additional module, so
I guess you meant nslookup, right?

And: I agree that we should have more reports about zpty on other
platforms and, if possible, configure tests for it before we can
really call it a supported module. But, to repeat it: in this case I
really can't help much because I made sure zpty works on all the
machines I have access to. Which also means, for example, that I'm not
even sure if all Linuxes have pty names in the range [a-z][0-9].

And before zpty ever makes it in, we'll also have to test if the
terminal-setups it uses are ok (especially the non-termios, non-termio 
case). We might also want to think about a better process handling and 
so on...

Bye
 Sven
