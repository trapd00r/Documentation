Thanks for the explanations and the fix. I read the section in
zshparam you referred to, not sure if i'm more or less confused now
but I think I found two typos.

"This  is  because parameter  expansions  may be surrounded balanced
braces, and subscript flags are introduced by balanced parenthesis."
should probably be 'surrounded by' and 'balanced parentheses'.

wow :).

Well,
typeset -A hi
hi=(\" hello)
echo $hi[<tab>

should ideally produce "$hi[\"]" but I don't even know if that's
possible or worth it. :) Or even
hi=(\* hello)
echo $hi[<tab>
would produce $hi[(e)*], but I guess at some point I just have to read
the manual and learn some of the subtler rules instead of depending on
the completion system as these are explained quite clearly there.
