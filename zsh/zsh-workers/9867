} Hm, right. One solution would be to add a new option to _path_files

} Hrm, just make _path_files add a warning to the list?

This isn't really a _path_files problem, is it?  It's the caller that
has put the `=' into IPREFIX.  I suppose it could produce a warning as
a courtesy, but it's really not _path_files job to figure out what that
equal sign means.  For all it knows, the command to which the x=y arg
is being passed is one that is able to expand the tilde internally.

Why don't we have _dd expand the tilde when magicequalsubst is not set,
and leave _path_files alone?

} I once had this idea of adding dummy widgets in the complist module,
} like menu-select-{up,down,...,accept} and so on. The problem is that I 
} would also like to automatically allow users to continue using their
} bindkeys if, for example, they happen to have reverse-menu-complete on 
} some key.

Hmmm ... so the issue really is that the entire notions of both "accept"
and "history" have been overloaded when menu-selection is active.  OK, I
drop the complaint for now ....
