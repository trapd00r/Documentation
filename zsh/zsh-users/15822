Hmm.  The following seems to do what I want, but seems kludgy and 
zsh-specific (which might be fine, but this seems like something other 
shells should be able to do).  (Main problem might be that I tend to 
code as if I'm using Perl even when I'm not.)

dosomething () {
     emulate -L zsh
     setopt err_return
     local temp=$(mktemp)
     function () {
         trap '(( $+temp )) && rm $temp' EXIT
         # ... do stuff ...
     }
     # at this point, $temp has always been cleaned up (error or no)
}
dosomething blah blah
# at this point, $temp is not leaked
