It's not really _users, it's _cd -- you have setopt cdablevars, and the
_cd function therefore attempts to expand anything that can come after
a tilde, even if the tilde is not explicitly present.  I think the call
tree is _cd -> _tilde -> _users.

This came up at least once before, try searching the archives.
