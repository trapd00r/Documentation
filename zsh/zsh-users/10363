 "Bi-directional pipe" (Jun  7,  2:50pm)

} Is there a way to make a bi-directional pipe in zsh?

Peter has already given an answer to this, but I just have to add that
having two processes connected in a loop this way is a sure road to
deadlock unless both processes are fully prepared for it (which means
for example that they're polling their input and output with select()
or poll() and using non-blocking reads and writes).

It might *seem* to work in simple tests, but that's just because the
operating system and/or the I/O library are doing buffering of the
input and output streams.  As soon as one of the processes produces
more output than will fit in the buffer, you're in deep trouble.
