} This patch sort of breaks completing when the first segment has spaces

As has come up elsewhere, the problem is that ${(q)...} is a bit too
aggressive for the purpose to which it is being put.  We need to quote
pattern characters in tmp1, but not other characters like spaces.

There's a rather ugly hunk of code in _path_files that does something
like this (see the comment "Explanation of substitution: ...") but
unfortunately I don't have time this morning to try to adapt it for
_multi_parts.
