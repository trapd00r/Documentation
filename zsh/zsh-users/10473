On Tuesday 2006-07-04 17:17 +1000, Bart Schaefer output:
:[Why are none of Alex's messages in the zsh-users archive, even though
:all the messages that reference them are there?  The original one is in
:gmane, marked as expiring on July 17, but none of the followups.]

People who send html or multipart/alternative messages have been
having delayed (manual) processing for years - dating back to when
lots more spam was able to pass through, before qconfirm and other
spam checks were put it place.  That measure's still in place.

Regards,
Geoff
