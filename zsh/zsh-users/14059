} My question is, how do I compile zsh so I end up with a "universal" binary?

I'm no expert, but "man cc" seems to indicate that you have to pass the
-arch option to the compiler multiple times.

This did it for me:

    make clean
    make CFLAGS='-arch i386 -arch ppc -arch ppc64' LDFLAGS='${CFLAGS}'

And now:

schaefer[398] file Src/zsh
Src/zsh: Mach-O universal binary with 3 architectures
Src/zsh (for architecture i386):        Mach-O executable i386
Src/zsh (for architecture ppc7400):     Mach-O executable ppc
Src/zsh (for architecture ppc64):       Mach-O 64-bit executable ppc64

I have no idea whether it'll actually *run* on all three platforms.
