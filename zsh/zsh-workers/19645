My experience is the same as James'.

[mneptok@anubis] mneptok :: zpty date date
[mneptok@anubis] mneptok :: zpty -r date

[mneptok@anubis] mneptok :: zsh --version
zsh 4.1.1 (powerpc-apple-darwin7.0)

Apple is shipping a pre-installed 4.1.1 binary, it's nothing I built. 
So someone at Apple has gotten this working. :)
