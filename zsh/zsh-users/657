Interesting.  The tar file that I have does indeed have the files there,
but they are gone from my directory.  Did make somewhere along the line
remove them?  To answer that I went looking at the Doc/Makefile and found:

clean: mostlyclean
        rm -f *.$(manext)
        rm -f *.y$(manext) *.ytexi paths.yo

I've done a "make clean" from the top level because I recompiled with a
different CFLAGS.

So, I'm not seeing things.  This is an error.  Configure should not erase
the .1 man pages if the user doesn't have yodl to rebuild them.

Now I have to pull them from the tar file.

<>Then I must be seeing things.  The few .yo files that I sampled sure looked

Yes and no.  As I mentioned in my posting, if one needs to add a new nroff
or TeX function, one has to edit these yodl macros (I assume they are macros)
to add the new functions.  This means one has to know nroff/TeX/texinfo and
now yodl.  It is true that this should habe to happen very often, but it
could still happen.

All we are going to agree on is that we disagree.
