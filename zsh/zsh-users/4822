} Can't help you with all of this... ;-)

Yeah, but you can help with a little of it.  In particular, `local' is
a synonym for `typeset', `typeset' (or `local') inside a function mean
to create a new variable in the scope of that function, and specifically

    local curcontext="$curcontext"

means to copy the value of the variable from the surrounding scope as
the value of the new variable in function scope, because "$curcontext"
is expanded before the `local' command is executed.
