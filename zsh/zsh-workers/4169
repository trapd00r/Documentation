Of course.  I thought first I'd find if anyone's working with u/win. Are you?

Here's what I get:

creating ./config.status
creating Makefile
creating Doc/Makefile
./config.status[150]: mkdir: : [No such file or directory]
creating Etc/Makefile
creating Src/Makefile
/dev/fd/11: /dev/fd/11: cannot open [Bad file descriptor]
./config.status: line 182: 321: Memory fault

u/win seems to get into a state where it can't find the current directory.Dave
