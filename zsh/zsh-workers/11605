Subject: Editing YODL files (slightly off topic)
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

For those of you who edit the zsh documentation, and who do it with emacs:
I've created a yodl-mode to reduce the likelyhood of paragraph-filling
accidents messing up the document formatting.  It's not perfect, but it
does a lot better than e.g. plain 'ol text-mode.

You can find it in ~barts/emacs/yodl-mode.el on zsh.sourceforge.net.
