You might as well, it's certainly less than urgent and you might notice
something I wouldn't.

I don't understand the reasoning:  why does this need to be different
from the way options or arguments work?  For redirection it would seem
to be a similar sort of case, where you might want to match on the
command name in the normal way.  Values certainly demand different
handling.  But then surely the logical thing is to keep the type
separate from the argument and have

:completion::complete:-value-:GZIP:

as the context?
