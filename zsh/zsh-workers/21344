This is rather garbled: the error message shown was a write error which
you certainly wouldn't see if the process that failed to write received
a SIGPIPE.  The question is whether the rest of the shell should
indicate the failure.  I think some shells indicate when a child
received SIGPIPE.

Experimentation suggests a SIGPIPE to a subprocess in a pipeline in
other shells doesn't cause the shell to abort execution.  I'm not sure
where the logic in zsh is that's causing this.
