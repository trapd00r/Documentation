Are you running this stand-alone or is it loaded as a shell function?

Did you update any any other part of Cygwin recently?

I'm going to assume the space before [0] is a line wrapping artifact.

Quite frankly I'm not sure how this ever worked.  With the ksh_arrays
option NOT set, ${someurl[1]} and ${someurl[0]} should always have been
the same value, and WITH ksh_arrays set, $someurl[2] is the same as
${someurl}[2] which would be interpreted as a file pattern (and either
error with "no match" or result in one of "database[2]" or nothing,
depending on the nomatch and nullglob options).

There is no case I know of where [[ ${someurl[1]} == $someurl[2] ]]
would be true, given the shown starting state of the array.

I can't think of any combination of setopts that would produce your
desired effect with that assortment of subscripting and braces.

} Started new shell and problem went away, but arrays now seem to be
} indexed from 1 rather than zero?? 
} 
} Did this change recently?

As Nikolai said, no, it did not.  Aside from the impossible scripting
above, could it be that someone has changed something in a startup file?
Perhaps in the Cygwin equivalent of /etc/zshenv or similar?
