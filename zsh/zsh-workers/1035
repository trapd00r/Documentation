The first edition of K&R, published in 1978, doesn't have enum as part of the
language. However, "The C Programmer's Handbook" published by Bell Labs in
1985 has enum. Also, the second edition of K&R, published in 1988, has this
little note (middle of page 215 in my copy): 'Enumerations are new since the
first edition of this book, but have been part of the language for some
years.'

I've used many different C compilers and it has been a long time since I've
seen one that doesn't support enumerations. So, I think it is safe to use
enum unless someone can document that enum is not supported by a compiler
on a system that is currently supported by zsh.
