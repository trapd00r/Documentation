I gave "cleartool" just as an example. The point is not that I do not
want
the subshells to NOT be created. In contrary, I *want* to have the
subshells
(and they are not always created by setting a view, but sometimes simply
by invoking "bash" or "zsh" respectively), because I often want to make
changes in the environment, do something, and then undo the changes,
i.e.
go back to the previous state of the environment. But there *are* quite
often
cases that I am deep in a series of interactive subshells, and decide I
do not want to back up one or two levels, but leave all of them and
logout.

So your solution doesn't solve the original problem either....
