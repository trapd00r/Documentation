There's a preference for patches in the message body, yes.  This is less
important than it used to be because the archive software has gotten
better at inlining text parts.

One my own pet peeves is the wild inconsistency of mime-type labeling of
attached diffs depending on what email client is used to attach them.
text/x-diff, text/x-patch, application/octet-stream, etc. etc.  No,
dammit, they're text/plain.  Just say so.
