Assume a command line, where the option --files mean that at least one
filename can be given after '--'

   cmd --files --other-options  ARG1 -- filenames...

(without --files the command line is
   cmd --other-options  ARG1 
)

The _arguments function does not seem applicable.

Any hints on how to write a completion function _cmd for this?
