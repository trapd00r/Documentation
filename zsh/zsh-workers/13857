I accept this but would argue that there are more commands which don't
allow other options to intervene. Things like tar can be achieved with
with states. Maybe _arguments needs some way to describe whether or not
options can intervene between an option and its argument. Things get
messy if more than one of the options take an argument.

zsh: bad option: -D

It doesn't though. This is why I was confused - why should it accept -l
but not -D. Is this something to do with ksh behaviour being used.
