Don't you mean -o nohistfcntllock?

I've attached a small program to test whether fcntl lock is working.

Usage: tfcntl <file> <sleeptime>

It will lock the file <file> for <sleeptime> seconds. You can execute
it with <sleeptime> = 1. If you don't get the prompt after 1 second,
then there's a problem. I've already seen such problems in the past
(the NFS server needed to be rebooted), which affected other software
using fcntl lock, e.g. mail software.
