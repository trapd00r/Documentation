If someone has some free time :-) then I would
appreciate it if someone could do some work on
the man pages.  In particular, the zshcompctl man
page needs to be restructured.  I've been too
busy with the rest of zsh to work on this much.

Also, the "Intro to zsh" document will eventually
need to be revised to reflect recent changes.

Any help here is appreciated.
