Subject: Zsh doesn't compile correctly out of the box for HPUX
X-Mailer: VM 7.07 under 21.4 (patch 8) "Honest Recruiter" XEmacs Lucid

It does compile, but zle doesn't function correctly unless you have
the LIBS line in the Makefile look like this:

   LIBS            = -lnsl -lHcurses -lcurses -lm  -lc

Notice that the Hcurses library has to be used instead of the default
curses.  What happens is the backspace doesn't work.  When you hit
backspace nothing happens (and in fact if stty is set to do a
backspace-space-backspace it actually just goes forward a space
instead of backwards).

I've had this problem dating back to HPUX 10.20 (and now on 11.11).

It would be nice to have a fix in configure or a note added to
MACHINES

Thanks zsh-workers
