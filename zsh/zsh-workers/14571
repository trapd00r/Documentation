} I'm fine with the consistency.  I just think that an unconditional
} reliance on NCURSES_VERSION being set is going to lead to trouble.

Back in 13987 you wrote:
} ncurses 4.2's tgetflag() will return ERR (-1) if called with an
} argument not found in boolcodes. ncurses 5.2's tgetflag() will return
} 0, a la Solaris.

The test in termcap.c is

    #if !defined(NCURSES_VERSION) || !defined(COLOR_PAIR)

COLOR_PAIR is defined in ncurses 4.2, so apparently this behavior has
bounced back and forth with different versions of ncurses.  So it looks
as if a configure test may be the safest approach, but it might be OK
to test (NCURSES_MAJOR_VERSION < 5).

I'm going to commit 14516 as it is, and then look at this a bit more.
