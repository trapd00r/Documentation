Single Unix Specification a.k.a. Unix 98 (current version). It is a 
superset of XPG (X/Open Portability Guide) that itself is superset of 
POSIX. It has a big advantage of being available online as opposed to 
either XPG or POSIX :-)

It is not bug - it complies with standards. Granted, there are 
compatibility issues (both ksh and bash behave the way you desire), but 
so far you are the first person to note it :-) That does not mean I am 
opposed to "fixing" it - I just have no idea how easy (or difficult) it is.
