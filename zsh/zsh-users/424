Hi,

Can anyone explain how I can get tilde-user completion to
handle usernames starting with numbers?  On SGIs, there's
a default user called "4Dgifts" that contains nice source
code examples and other goodies.  When referring to this
user home directory with ~4Dgifts, zsh tells me

fuligin_3:37PM>ls ~4Dgifts
zsh: not enough directory stack entries.

and the same error for echo ~4Dgifts

tcsh handles this user correctly.

Details:  this problem was observed in zsh-2.6beta17 and now in zsh-3.0.0
on Irix 5.3 and 6.2

BTW: zsh-3.0.0 built clean "out of the box" on both Irix 5.3 and 6.2.  No
other obvious problems seen yet....

Colin.
