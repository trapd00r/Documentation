The first argument comes directly from what nl_langinfo(CODESET) is
returning.  I've tried it on our rather old Solaris 8 system and I get
the same as you, 646---and my iconv doesn't handle that either.

I asked the nice man from Mountain View about "nl_langinfo CODESET 646"
and it seems Solaris just sort of does that if doesn't think much of the
current codeset (e.g. not installed).

So I think we just need to massage it to some reasonable default, which
probably means "US-ASCII" (I'm not sure why that's better than "ASCII",
which I thought was unique, but that's what people seem to use---POSIX
rather self-centredly suggests "POSIX" but iconv doesn't seem to support
that).  I don't think 646 means anything, so I haven't made this
dependent on system.  Assuming ASCII shouldn't be a problem:  if the
7-bit subset isn't ASCII the shell is likely to have disappeared in a
puff of smoke by now.

I suppose trapping "" is a good thing, too, since iconv_open() doesn't
appear to have useful defaults (and there's no reason why it should
have).

As they say in US police dramas, "I'm denying your 646".  Or something.
