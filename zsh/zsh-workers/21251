} We wouldn't lose it but the conversion may not be as smooth. I think the
} easiest way to turn docbook into Texinfo is using docbook2x

This is not increasing my enthusiasm.  The whole reason we chose yodl
way back when was because that meant *one* piece of format-conversion
software was required to produce all the output formats we wanted.
Requiring a greater number of conversion tools from a wider variety of 
sources and that may be available on a smaller number of target OSs, is
not a step forward in my opinion.

} (http://docbook2x.sourceforge.net/). I don't know much about it,
} however. Do docbook2x's own info files look good to you?

It looks OK based on the Cygwin screen shot, but I'm not going to
install it just to find out.

} the current set of six indices anyway.

Well, no, neither do I, but that's a limitation of the info format.
