from the man page...

 	For example, `typeset -F SECONDS' causes the value to be reported 
as a floating point number.  The precision is six decimal places, although 
not all places may be useful.

but i see something like this...
 	% echo $SECONDS
 	25912.5868740000

with ten decimal places.

i want that number to be reported only to hundredths of a second (two 
decimal places). i could just say that there are 10 decimal places and i 
want to get rid of eight:
 	print "${SECONDS/%????????/}"
 	25867.46

but that would break if the number of digits after the decimal point 
changes. which leads me to:
 	% foo=${(z)${(s:.:)SECONDS}} ; echo ${foo[1]}.${(r:2:)foo[2]}
 	25969.87

which works fine, but i'm wondering if there's a more graceful way to do 
that without an intermediate variable (foo, in this case).

any ideas....?
