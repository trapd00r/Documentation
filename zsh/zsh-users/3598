Subject: completing for a marvelous lesspipe ?

Hi fellows!

      The other day i bought one of our german speaking LinuxMags
(LinuxMagazin) with
one article about the following lesspipe ( a filter mechanism for
less, the pager):
You can download it here:
   http://www-zeuthen.desy.de/~friebel/unix/lesspipe.html

The beauty of this lesspipe is that it can show the contents of
deb,rpm zip,tar.gz and tar.bz2 files and some more.

      Now it would be still more useful if such a mighty
completion-system -as zsh has - would complete files after
the colon in e.g. compressed files 
(lesspipe can only handle one argument so the author
had to put the other arguments after a seperator , a colon
here) and do some smart completing with other cases.

Are there even smarter lesspipes?

Any ideas about a clever completion for less with that
lesspipe.sh as filter ?

Matthias
