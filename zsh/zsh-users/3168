Hi,
    Sorry for the Off Topic question, it is not really zsh related, but
    shell related.

    I have a couple of isps on my linux box, and some of them need a
    proxy setting. So nearly everytime I dial up, I have to export the
    http_proxy in order to use it. Now is there an easy/smart way to do
    this rather than doing it manually?

Regards,


Shao.
