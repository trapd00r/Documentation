Hi

What might be causing this error in zsh.

eric@apple:~$ echo $SHELL
/bin/bash
eric@apple:~$ ls /tmp -F
ssh-XXUIWy1q/  v235390/
eric@apple:~$ zsh
[eric@apple ~]  $ ls -F /tmp
ssh-XXUIWy1q/  v235390/

... and here is the problem:
[eric@apple ~]  $ ls /tmp -F
ls: -F: No such file or directory
/tmp:
ssh-XXUIWy1q  v235390

thanks
