I think (though I haven't checked) that it's because of the prefork() in
multsub(), which gets called for subexpressions.  This means that all
forms of $-style expansion as well as ` and ~/= expansion get handled at
each level at which a nested ${...} is processed.  Yes, this probably
ought to be documented if anyone understood it well enough.
