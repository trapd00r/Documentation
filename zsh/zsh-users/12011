     Hi,
     
     I search ideas to have a good prompt which display the cpu frequency

What's your operating system?  I think this stuff is highly OS-dependent.  On Ubuntu Linux,
for example, I have /proc/acpi 

On OSX, system_profiler yields a lot of information but is too sluggish.
system_profiler -detailLevel mini
might be good enough.
