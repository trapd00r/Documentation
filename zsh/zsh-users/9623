    Hi Sebastian :)

    But, according with the info manual of version 4.2.5,
which-command exists as a widget, and by default is bound to ESC-?

    Try binding it to another combination just to test.

    And oh, BTW, you have to have a shell function, alias or command
called "which-command", of course, because the widget calls it (in
fact, it does exactly that, calls "which-command CMD", where "CMD" is
the current command in the editor buffer.
