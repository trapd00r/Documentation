This is a deliberate feature.  The logic is that you can't actually move
files across devices, and the purpose of mv is to move files, so mv can't
move files across devices.  The historical versions that do a copy and
remove are actually providing behaviour radically different from what
mv is intended for.  If you want a copy and remove, rather than a move,
you can use cp and rm yourself.
