We saw this business apropos of something else a while ago.  OPEN_MAX
is actually not the maximum limit, since it's run-time configurable
under Solaris 2.  So presumably the difference that's causing the OS bug
to show up is because csh is too old-fashioned to care.  Unless there's
some reason for not following getrlimit() if all those descriptors aren't
needed.
