Subject: Autoloaded objects lifetime
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii; format=flowed
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Currently autoloadable objects disappear after modules have been loaded 
(I looked for builtins but I guess it is true for other as well). If 
module is unloaded, these objects disappear. Like

{pts/3}% ulimit
unlimited
{pts/3}% zmodload -u zsh/rlimits
{pts/3}% ulimit
zsh: command not found: ulimit

Is it intended behaviour?
