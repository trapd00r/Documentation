} Ksh and bash both have a printf builtin. This adds one to zsh.

Did you also notice that "print -f" in ksh is the same as printf?

This raises the question of whether it should be possible to combine
print -f with all the other print options, which would imply quite a
different implementation from what's in this patch, and would likely
preclude it from being a module.
