You mean run-help on \ls doesn't work?  The shell doesn't know what the
run-help alias/function is going to do with the information so provides
exactly what it got.  Using a more sophisticated version of run-help would
do the trick; even turning "man $1" into "eval man $1" would work.
However, that's a little dangerous to have as the default.

(GNU man seems to accept "man '\ls'", as it happens.)
