Is it the order of the expansions that surprised you. It often helps us
understand a point like this if you state what you expected to obtain.

<-> doesn't expand a sequence in order. Like *, it is just matching
filenames except it looks for a number within a range. Files are matched
and then sorted.

You could use {1..19} for an ordered expansion but that expands
unconditionally: there doesn't need to be existing files with each name
in the sequence.

Alternatively, you can use the (n) glob qualifier to sort the
expansions numerically:
  patch*(n)
