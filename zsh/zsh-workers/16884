Subject: Piping stderr (was Re: Two bug reports)

I'm wondering if it would be nice to create a syntax for piping just
stderr?  We already have "|&" for piping both stdout and stderr, so
perhaps we could extend this somehow?  What do you think about using
"2|&"?  Or maybe "2>|&" (which is probably safer).  Do any other shells
have a syntax for this?
