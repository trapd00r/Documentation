MW1G17C% compinstall
I haven't found any existing completion definitions.
If you have some already defined by compinstall, edit the name of the
file where these can be found.  Note that this will only work if they
are exactly the form in which compinstall inserted them.  If you leave
the line as it is, or empty, I won't search.
file> /cygdrive/h//.zshrc

Note the double slash here. It happens, because I have home drive
mapping in my profile so NT automatically sets

HOME=H:\

that is being translated by Cygwin into

/cygdrive/h/
