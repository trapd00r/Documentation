Yes, thanks.  Actually went through shell1.sourceforge.net and had
lots of problems with it after putting in my SSH public key.  It
kept disconnecting when my side tried to do RSA authentication.
So what if my key is 2048 bits instead of the default 1024?
Anyway, I had some memory of someone saying it could be set up to do
automatic builds on different platforms but couldn't find anything
about it via www.zsh.org/mla/ so maybe I've been out in the sun too
much and nobody said that?

Oh, also, www.zsh.org/mla/ isn't giving me any responses to any y2000
articles via wilma.  I'll look at fixing that now.
