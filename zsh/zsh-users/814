If it is the most logical for you, it's fine. But if it isn't, it does all
those lookups for no reason. Actually, I don't care so much, I don't have to
use them, right ? (my .zprofile and .zlogin are always empty since I mostly
login via XDM anyway)

The problem is more with /etc/zprofile and /etc/zlogin since you have to be
careful with what you put in there: it might very well break (be broken by)
..zshenv (and even .zprofile and .zshrc for the /etc/zlogin).

I'd be perfectly happy with

        /etc/zshenv, /etc/zshrc, ~/.zshenv, ~/.zshrc

This way there is no weird interaction between user's and system's files.

Anyway, this is all hot-air because it's not going to change any time soon,
