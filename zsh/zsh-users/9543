    Hi all :)

    $ print \[\\\]
    []
    $ /bin/echo -e \[\\\]
    [\]
    $ print -r \[\\\]
    [\]
    $ print \\
    \

    I was expecting the second when issuing the first command...
As I understand, the string should be interpreted as "a quoted
opening square bracket, a quoted backslash, a quoted closing square
bracket", but it is not :?? But in the last case, "print" is
correctly quoting the backslash :?

    I discovered this when I accidentally created a file named "[\]"
when testing the behaviour that one of my scripts has with weird
characters, and then I did "print *" and got that problem.

    What am I misunderstanding here? Thanks a lot in advance :)
