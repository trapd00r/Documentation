This is better, but I can still put the cursor between the a and the ~.

But instead of pressing a, type a '!' and go left again and press 'a',
then press ctrl-d. (or ctrl-t)

Another thing I noticed is that ctrl-t moves just the combining char,
not the whole base+combiningchar, but that might already be on your
todo as a subset of "fix widgets" :).
