Yes, that's how I understood it as well in the first place. I thought
the way the person on IRC understood it was reasonable as well. But
it's true that people shouldn't see every sentence as potential
real-life examples.

Okay. But I hope that won't lead people to demand warning notes for
every little piece of documentation that (treated alone) looks like an
example.

No! :-) I just didn't know how to express what I wanted to say
properly.

Yes, that was my reply on IRC as well. I was just confused and didn't
think close enough before posting.

No, I don't. But thank you anyway. :)
