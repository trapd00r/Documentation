i am messing with it , too. it is good to look at the 
compctl-examples, that i think come with the beta-version of zsh3.

but i am wondering, if there has been someone, who did something
like the  completion-editor for the tcsh.
(well it could have been a configuration-editor for the tcsh, i might
be wrong, it has been written in tcl/tk, but i don't have the name
right now)
