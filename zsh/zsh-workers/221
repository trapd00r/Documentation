  First off praise for the excellent shell and the extraordinary effort
  (and clearly knowledge) you all do to keep it at the forefront.

  I have just switched from 2.5.03 to 2.6-beta10 and I should like
  to pass along a couple of comments.  (My system is HPUX s700/9.01


  o When I now 'su user' command line editing ceases to work.
    No amount of 'bindkey -v' gets it back.  Control chars print nothing
    when typed but hitting return causes an execution attempt. For example:
    ESC k prints nothing but after a return:

    %
    zsh: command not found: ^[k

    Things seems 'messed up' in other ways too. For example I can
    backspace over the prompt and even thru to previous lines.

    The workaround I have found is to 'rlogin localhost' which is
    really not massively pleasant.

    Curiously 'su root' works fine.

    Observation: After the 'su' the variable TTY becomes unset and
		 unsetable: Is this related ?
		 The variable BAUD turns to 0.

   --> Help ?

  o vi editing: the '.' command has changed. If I recall a line
    and want to change 2 instances of a word with another - in the
    earlier version I sould move cursor to start of 'word1' and 'cw' and
    change to new value. Then move cursor to 'word2' and '.'
    This erases word2 but does not replace the text. The new behaviour
    is not consistent with the vi editor.

   --> Bug ?

  o Split man pages. I know this is religious but the multiple sections
    are not convenient (for me) to use at all. In days of yore i could simply
    'man zsh' and then search back and forward for what I needed to my
    little heart's content. Now I need to first remember the name of
    the 5 sections and work with them all.

    I suspect having separate sections is brilliant for the man
    page writer and a somewhat painful for the consumer. Perhaps the middle
    ground is to have each section include the next ?

   --> Not a bug.


  Thanks.
