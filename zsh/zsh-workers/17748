Hello,

In the email below Johannes found there was a problem
with various keys like backspace not working with the
default compilation of what I think would have been
zsh 4.0.4 on HP-UX 11.00.  I encountered the same
problem when compiling zsh 4.0.6 on HP-UX 11.00 with
gcc 3.2 like:

./configure --disable-dynamic

I just wanted to let you know that the fix Johannes
suggested worked for me also.  I edited the configure
script, and on the line termcap_curses_order in
the following case statement:

  case "$host_os" in
  hpux10.*|hpux11.*|solaris*)
      termcap_curses_order=3D"curses ncurses termcap" ;;

I changed it to:

      termcap_curses_order=3D"ncurses curses termcap" ;;

then did:


./configure --disable-dynamic
make install

Then the backspace key works fine.  I used ncurses 5.2.

Thanks, Mark

I "solved" my zsh/termcap problem on our HPUX 11.00 system
by using the brute-force-method:
Installing ncurses-5.0 locally und linking
zsh with these libraries instead of the 
original HPUX-curses library solved the problem.

Nevertheless, thanks to anyone who replied to my mail.
