I assume this it's deliberate that ssh is not set up to handle X11
forwarding --- it's always been like this with interactive logins.  It's
possible they've just noticed this wasn't happening on the CVS port.  The
warning is from the local ssh; in this case it obviously doesn't need X11
forwarding, so the bug is really that it bothers testing and warning you,
because CVS isn't passing the right flags to ssh.

I've got rid of this by pointing CVS_RSH at the following scriptlet:

  #!/bin/sh
  ssh -x "$@"
