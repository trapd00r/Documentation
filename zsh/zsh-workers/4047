I don't think you even need to make it local, since $0 is handled
similarly to the other positional arguments.

% fn() { 0=foo; echo $0; }  
% fn
foo
% echo $0
zsh

This fact should probably be construed as a genuine feature.  If you're
asking, is some bright spark going to decide that $0 should be different
from $1 to $infinity and break it, I can't answer that, but it won't be me.
