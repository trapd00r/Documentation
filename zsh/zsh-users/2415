Subject: can't get cd completion to work on solaris 2.6
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=gb2312

Greetings to everyone on the list...

I have a problem which has been buffling me for quite a 
while. Basically I cannot get the following simple 
completion to work:

compctl -g '*(-/)' cd

I have gotten most of other completions to work as 
described on the manpages and tutorials. But this
one simply refuses to work. When I hit "cd <tab>",
it just generates a beep and nothing happens. This 
is on Solaris 2.6 for both Sparc and x86. BTW, I 
don't have this problem in Linux.

So is this a bug or what else can I do to figure out
what is wrong?

Thanks much.

Qiwei Xiao
