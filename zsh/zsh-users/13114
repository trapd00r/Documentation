getent is definitely present, and anyway, /etc/passwd and /etc/group
are tiny stub files on this box--no more than 50 lines each.

LOGNAME appears to be set correctly (adavies).

The code in my compaudit is

===============================
# RedHat Linux "per-user groups" check.  This is tricky, because it's very
# difficult to tell whether the sysadmin has put someone else into your
# "private" group (e.g., via the default group field in /etc/passwd, or
# by NFS group sharing with an untrustworthy machine).  So we must assume
# that this has not happened, and pick the best group.

local GROUP GROUPMEM _i_pw _i_gid _i_ulwdirs
while IFS=: read GROUP _i_pw _i_gid GROUPMEM; do
  if (( UID == EUID )); then
    [[ $GROUP == $LOGNAME ]] && break
  else
    (( _i_gid == EGID )) && break       # Somewhat arbitrary
  fi
done <<(getent group)
===============================

which looks to me like it *will* get all groups.

FWIW, "getent group" returns 773 lines and takes about 3.5 minutes to run.
