Subject: a little problem with the second argument to cd

Usually, "cd x y" works fine, but in the following situation it
does not work:

  $ mkdir foo foo/libfoo foo/libbar
  $ cd foo/libfoo

Now I want to cd into libbar:

  $ cd foo bar
  cd: no such file or directory: .../bar/libfoo
                                   ^^^^^^

Can I force zsh to consider foo/libbar as a match too (preferrably
without re-implementing the whole functionality as a script)?

Ciao
