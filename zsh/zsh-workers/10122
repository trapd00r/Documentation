} exits loops and sublists and whatnot.

I think this is done because it's so difficult (still) to stop/kill a
loop that contains nothing but builtins.  If you've got a builtin going
wrong and that prevents the loop from ever reaching the end ...

We really need to figure out how to handle interrupts during builtins
before we start fooling with clearing errflag in additional cases.
