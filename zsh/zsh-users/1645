3.1.4 has the same problem.  This is exactly the bug that I described in
<http://www.zsh.org/mla/workers-1998/msg00372.html> (article 4037 if you
use the FTP archive (thanks, Geoff)) -- interrupting a read() with SIGINT
causes zsh to set lexstop to 1, which eventually causes the shell to exit.

I finally figured out where that's happening -- it's in ingetc(), which
is called from the SIGINT handler() via inerrflush().  However, I still
don't know how to fix the problem.
