} and type Ctrl-G in Emacs. Then zsh terminates with a SIGINT, killing
} Emacs at the same time.

This must be happening because either (1) emacs resets the TTY intr
character to ^G or (2) emacs is sending a SIGINT to the terminal pgrp
when it sees ^G.  Experimenting with "trap 'stty -a' INT" seems to
point to the latter, but the SIGINT only makes it through to zsh once
(or at least the trap fires only on the first ^G).

Either way, I think this is a problem with emacs rather than zsh.  Try
replacing emacs with a command that doesn't do its own input handling
("sleep 10", perhaps) and then type the normal intr character (^C).
Do you expect the script to exit on *that* SIGINT?  [It does.]
