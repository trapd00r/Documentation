    Hi Oliver :)

    Yes!! I'm not used with the 'r' flag, and I didn't think of it.
But yes, removing both suffixes at one time is just the same. In
fact, both the .jpg and the two digit number are just suffixes for the
image name.

    How can I do using eval? Assume that I don't have the (u) flag...

    Thanks !
