While figuring out environ problem, I got a look at locale
implementation in Cygwin. There is no :-) setlocale() is just a stub
function that accepts "C" as locale name and nothing more. It does
nothing :-))) And locale table contains only ASCII support. So, I
wonder, how can it work correclty even for ISO-8859-1 charset.
