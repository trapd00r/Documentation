Well.... 'set up' may be an overstatement.  There is nothing there yet.   
Feel free to start sending patches.

In order for it to work:

- Messages must be sent to: zsh@peak.org

- Messages must be ASCII (not MIME)

- Messages must have a Subject: line which begins with

PATCH:

I'd suggest that descriptive Subject lines be given, so as to make the  
archive more useful, such as

PATCH: zsh-version-number filename

for example:

PATCH: 3.0.4 Src/subst.c

Suggestions?  Comments?
