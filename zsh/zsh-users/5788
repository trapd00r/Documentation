You have not read carefully enough :)

menu
.....
     Finally, the two special modes of menu selection, namely
     interactive mode and incremental search can be pre-selected with
     this style. By including the word `interactive' in the value,
     interactive mode will be entered immediately when menu selection
     is started and the string `search' does the same for incremental
     search. To select backward incremental search, include the string
     `search-backward'.

It is not default because it is still experimental, it is slow (yes, it =
_is_
slow) and it is very different from usual way. I personally found that
hitting three times cursor key needs the same time as typing in three
characters of next match :))
