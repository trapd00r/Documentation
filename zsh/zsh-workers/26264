What version are you running? Can you upgrade and use that version
for some time?

Can you try to use one shell per task? Does only only shell crash?
Do the crashes stop?

I don't know if it's feasible to run zsh within Valgrind for your daily
work, but that might help.


Also, _when_ does this happen? Randomly, or..?
