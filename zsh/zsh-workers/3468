Wow, I was almost deafened by the silence of my last request.  Anyway, I
switched the shell to use "bash" and getopts works just fine there.  I
believe we have a bug, cap'n.

while getopts G2rd: OPT
do
  case $OPT in
   '2'|'r'|'G') GENARG=($GENARG -$OPT) ;;
    'd') echo printer is $OPTARG ;; #LPARG=-d$OPTARG ;;
    '?') echo $0:t: Unknown option $OPTARG; exit 1 ;;
    ':') echo $0:t: Option required for $OPTARG; exit 1 ;;
  esac
done
