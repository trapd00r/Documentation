Zsh 4.0.4 appears to lose the time command in the following,

nathan@garibaldi:363>for i in 1 2 ; time echo


but, place the command in a subshell, and it works.

nathan@garibaldi:364>for i in 1 2 ; time (echo)

( echo )  0.00s user 0.00s system 0% cpu 0.000 total

( echo )  0.00s user 0.00s system 0% cpu 0.000 total
