Subject: [bug] completion makes input jump up one line
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.58.0402140150450.30356@localhost>
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=ISO-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: QUOTED-PRINTABLE

under 4.1, if i tabcomplete, and one of the matches in the list is a=20
multiple of $COLUMNS, ie, if the last letter of the match is in the=20
rightmost column, the whole thing jumps up one line. i confirmed it with=20
caphuso on #zsh, it happens in 4.1, but not 4.0
here is a "screenshot":
