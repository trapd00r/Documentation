Please help,

I have been using the following construct quite often (recently it does not work
any more, since there has been a `bug fix` in ZSH)

e.g.
file  Test

#!/bin/zsh
Pattern=$1(.)
eval List=$Pattern


invoking it like

Test `**/*`

I got the expansion in $List.

How is it done now?

Thanks for any helps.
