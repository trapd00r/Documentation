            The string must be
            L'\0' terminated, contain at most one character with strictly pos-
            itive width, which must be the first, and contain no characters of
            negative width.

I think it's trying to take account of combining characters (which zsh
doesn't handle at all yet and which, not coincidentally, I haven't got a
clue about).
