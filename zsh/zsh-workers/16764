I whipped up some test cases of the history mechanism, specifically
of the way the event numbers change.  (The option that prevents
"history" commands from being stored in the list does unintuitive things
to the event numbers, and I wanted to investigate that further.)

Is there a way to get a shell to source a bunch of commands and still
print prompts after each one?  It would be much easier than "cut, paste
into an interactive shell, note the prompts".

(Prompts are a good testing mechanism because you can easily find out
lots of information.)
