Subject: (zsh-4.3.2) Y03 test failure under Slackware Linux 9.0.0
From: Eric De Mund <ead@ixian.com>
Reply-To: Eric De Mund <ead@ixian.com>

People,

I'm experiencing a "make check" failure in test Y03 when building
zsh-4.3.2 under Slackware Linux 9.0.0 on a i686-pc-linux-gnu host, as I
experienced back in March of this year (Message-ID:
<17433.46602.590991.508063@bear.he.net>).

The build seemed to succeed as did the install, so I'm able to go
forward with my use of zsh-4.3.2. However, perhaps a zsh worker may wish
to look into this.

If so, my Y03 test failure can be browsed at
<http://www.ixian.com/ead/tmp/zsh-4.3.2/make-check.out>. As can every
aspect of this build be browsed at
<http://www.ixian.com/ead/tmp/zsh-4.3.2/>; I've made all the directories
and files world-readable.

FYI, the commands I issued were:

    % bzcat ~/tmp/zsh-4.3.2.tar.bz2 | tar -xvf -
        [output elided]
    % cd zsh-4.3.2
    % ./configure --prefix=$HOME/local --disable-zprofile LDFLAGS="-s"
        [output elided]
    % make |& tee make.out
        [output elided]
    % make check |& tee make-check.out
        [output elided]
    % make -k check |& tee make-check-2.out
        [output elided]
    % make install |& tee make-install.out
        [output elided]

Thank you for a superb shell; I've been a happy user of it since 1989.

Regards,
Eric
