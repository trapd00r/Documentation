Subject: why doesn't 'source *' work?


Is there a reason why 'source *' doesn't work?

Is there a setopt I need to configure?

Thanks

TjL

ps -- I'm using zsh-3.1.4, mainly since I'm no longer sure where to get  
current source for zsh and last time I tried it bombed when trying to compile  
for NeXTStep....
