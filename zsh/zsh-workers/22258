    Hi Roumen :)

    Sorry for not answering before.

 * Roumen Petrov <bugtrack@roumenpetrov.info> dixit:
> I would like to know if option SH_WORD_SPLIT is set problem is solved too ?

    I don't know what you mean, but for the rest of the thread I
reckon you meant something about SH_WORD_SPLIT unset when zsh is
invoked as /bin/zsh and not as /bin/sh.

    If you want to write a "portable" script (which is very
difficult, believe me) you should use "#! /bin/sh" as the first line.
This will set SH_WORD_SPLIT in zsh. By the way, for *really* portable
script, use the first line as shown above, with a space between the
bang and the slash.
