Hi all,

I've just started using zsh and I can't seem to get it not to report when I
receive mail.  I've tried doing "unsetopt mailwarning" but that seems to
have no effect.  This is on a Solaris 2.3 system.  I suppose I could set
the MAILCHECK variable to some absurdly high level, but that's just a
kludge.  Any suggestions?

Thanks,

Mike
