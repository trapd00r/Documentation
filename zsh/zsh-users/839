	The only feature of bash i miss in zsh is the variable
$PROMPT_COMMAND if set in .bashrc everytime you login for the entire
session the command defined as the variable, is executed before each
prompt.
	I'd like to able to run a mail notification program i wrote thru
it.  Is there any to be constantly running a program? Or anything that
would work in my situation?
