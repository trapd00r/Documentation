I made sure to setopt beep because I have no_beep in my .zshrc file.
However, after making some changes I sourced .zshrc and reverted back!
Sorry.  I realized this problem last night, after I had shut my machine down
and was lying safely in bed.

Upon returning to it, I found that ^[ was not bound to anything.  So,

   bindkey "^[" vi-cmd-mode

was all I needed.  Initially I had

   bindkey -M viins "^[" vi-cmd-mode

but upon closer inspection it appears that viins isn't really my keymap.
I've been using emacs without realizing it.  :(  However, EDITOR and VISUAL
are both set to vi -- in my .zshrc file.  Does it matter where these are
set?  The main page checks these "when the shell starts up."
