When I just tried zsh 3.0.1 on my i386-next-nextstep3 I noticed the following  
problem: when tying very fast using Ctrl-A and Ctrl-K as well, I can get into  
a weird screen update problem, where each additional entered character  
triggers a redraw of the whole line, but with a carriage return before  
redrawing, and sometimes even some characters will be drawn on top of each  
other!!!

Now this might be a problem with the next terminal, but it didn't happen in  
zsh-3.0.0.
I tried to reproduce the problem with zsh -f, but couldn't. On the other hand  
I managed to produce a semgentation fault using zsh -f, and just typing  
characters, Ctrl-A, Ctrl-D, Ctrl-S, Ctrl-K!!!

Again, I have never managed to make zsh-3.0.0 produce a segmentation fault.
