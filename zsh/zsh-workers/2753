Heyla,

zsh-3.0.3-test3% elm
zsh: permission denied: elm                                                    

However it works OK with:
zsh-3.0.3-test1
zsh-3.0.3-test3 -f

% ls -l =elm
-r-x--s--x  1 bin  mail  282624 Nov 17 22:41 /usr/local/bin/elm/elm

I'll try and isolate it further, though my startup stuff obviously works with
previous zshs.  Hopefully more info to come soon.
