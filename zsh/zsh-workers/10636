Yes, exactly for this reason I'd really prefer built-in solution if at
all possible. Keybinding is not an issue here (not really). But, of
course, not in this release.

I have not answered because I do not actually care. What matters to me
is the ability to see the full list. If I'm on X11 I can scroll - and if
I'm on tty, it does not help anyway.  May be, something like "output
does not fit on screen" would be nice - currently, it is not obvious.
That is, there are two cases

- list can be shown in full, but user set it to small value
- ilst does not fit at all

To distinguish between them is nice.

The problem is, with all power of Zsh completion, I'm getting in habit
to simply press TAB and see list of command options :-) And it is
exactly this case, when output mostly does not fit on a screen.
