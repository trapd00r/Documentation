People,

Why do some ampersands placed after single-word commands
(e.g. "% ooffice &", and "% xmms &") jump one space to the left (e.g. to
"% ooffice&", and "% xmms&") upon my hitting the enter key? I've been
using Zsh for about 15 years, now, and I believe this is the first time
I've ever observed behavior that I didn't explicitly call for or impli-
citly (such as with options) call for.

This ampersand jumping:

1.  is intermittent;
2.  only seems to occur with single-word commands (i.e. the two-word
      command "% ooffice foo.sxw &" remains as is upon my hitting the
      enter key);
3.  only occurs in local rxvt(1) rather than remote ssh(1) shells (both
      of which use identical ~/.z* startup files);

My environment--along with pointers to all my ~/.z* startup files--is:

Thank you. I'll happily assist in any way I can in the debugging of
this.
