:There is usually a limit on how long the #! line can be, 32 characters
:or so. The error message always complains it can't find the script
:file, not the interpreter. You've passed the length limit. This is a
:kernel problem, rather than zsh. :-)

This isn't the problem here.  The limit is 64 characters, and the message for
exceeding this is: "exec format error". (It has nothing to do with the kernel)
Another possibility could be that the program's not in his path, and he should
do ./cf.zsh
