} } Perhaps that would be nice but I'm not sure it worth the extra code it adds.
} 
} Appended is an implementation using zsh functions to wrap the builtin
} setopt/unsetopt commands.

I should have mentioned that this implementation is not suitable for use
in combination with "setopt localoptions" in shell functions.  If you
use this wrapper, then your shell functions that desire localoptions need
to always use "builtin setopt".

Having the behavior itself built in to zsh would eliminate that problem.
