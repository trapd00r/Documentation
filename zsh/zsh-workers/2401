Csh, at least, invokes its onintr handlers when any process spawned from
a csh script gets a keyboard interrupt.  /bin/sh (pre-POSIX, at least)
invokes its INT traps on a single interrupt, AFAIK.

Sometimes the shell is in a loop spawning jobs too fast for pressing ctrl-C
twice to have the desired effect.  What good is an INT handler if zsh never
gets the signal?

} What does POSIX say about all of this?

I'd be interested, too.
