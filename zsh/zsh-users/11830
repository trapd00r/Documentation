I got this response to an inquiry of the staff at sunsite.dk:

 We've had a major server crash as explained on http://dotsrc.org. We
 have been recovering from it since then and have mail and mailinglists
 running again now. Sorry for the inconvenience.

Newer stuff appears to be coming through the list ahead of any backlog,
so hold off for a while before re-sending anything that hasn't made it
through since last weekend.
