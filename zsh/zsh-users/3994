Hello,

I liked  zsh in  the past, but  it is quite  annoying for  bash users,
that I cannot set the following behaviour:

I start  typing: "ls  bing", then I  go back to  the beginning  of the
word "bing",  and I type: "/u"  and I press tab.  Bash completes this,
and it will become "ls /usrbing", but zsh does not do anything.

Can anyone  helping with  this problem?  Can zsh be  set up  to behave
like bash?

Thanks in advance,

dLux
