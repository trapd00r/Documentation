Hi again,

another question that I've been asking myself for a long time.
Now I decided the list is the better place to ask this.  :-)

I am wondering why zsh doesn't come with some useful defaults?
No wonder that many people don't even know about zsh or try it once and
never again, because without at least a prompt that shows the current dir
it's worse than command.com.  No, sorry I'm exagerating. :-)

But I'd really find it a good idea to provide the beginner with a little
more of the really powerful things zsh has to offer.  Anyone seconds?
 Andy.
