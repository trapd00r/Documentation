} echotc and echoti output the capability strings directly to the
} terminal, with output padding.

Well, directly to standard output, which is assumed to be the terminal.

echotc and echoti are also capable of replacing positional arguments
into the termcap/terminfo string.  E.g.

	echotc cm 12 20
or
	echoti cup 12 20

places the cursor in row 12 column 20.

You can probably work out how to do this with some sort of replacement
on ${terminfo[cup]} but it won't be pretty.
