Subject: piping stderr

X-Virus-Status: Clean

i'd like to pipe all stderr from a script into a command to do logging... 
but this isn't synchronous:
 	exec 2> >( multilog /path/ )

i need it to be synchronous so that multiple scripts running at the same 
time (and also logging debug messages) can all log together and not 
clobber each others output.

is it possible to do what i'm trying?

thanks...
