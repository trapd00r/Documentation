No, "autoload -U" is valid; autoload is historically derived from
functions -u which is derived from typeset -f... it's a little more
complicated nowadays since the options are different, but it's still the
case that running any of those commands with no non-option arguments
displays a list of whatever entity it is that has the specified flags
set, in this case autoloaded functions.

I'm a bit surprised to see it shows functions that have already been
autoloaded, however... it seems the presence of the -U flag makes it
(also) show functions that were previously autoloaded with that flag
set.  Conceivably this is useful.
