These two lines in your .zshrc are the reason. The hosts style here
tells zsh's hosts completion to ignore /etc/hosts and complete the
listed hosts instead. If you want it to use /etc/hosts, try removing at
least the second of those lines.

The example .zshrc wasn't really intended to be just picked up and used
after changing nothing more than the prompt.
