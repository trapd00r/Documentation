We can probably add your stuff as an option; I'm a bit worried about
forcing fcntl() locking on everybody willy nilly.  This probably needs
to wait till after 4.3.5 otherwise that will never get out at this rate.

It's possible there's an overagressive test for a write failure; I added
some more after reports of problems.  You might be able to track down
where this is coming from fairly easily.
