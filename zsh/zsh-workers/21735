    Yes.

    I know that, but I assumed, from the documentation, that "return"
and "exit" were handled differently in any context (even in scripts).
Couldn't a little note be added to the docs in the last part, where
the warning about "An exit command encountered in try-list [...]"
already exists. I know, I know, every zsh user should take into
account that a return-is-an-exit-in-a-script, OK, but I think that it
would be a good idea to add a little reminder O:)

> To treat returns as returns you need a function.

    OK, thanks for the information :))
