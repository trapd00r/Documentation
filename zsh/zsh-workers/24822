Hi Peter,

Note that uxterm is generally a script that calls xterm with the
-u8 function, so you could say "recent versions of xterm"
instead. From http://invisible-island.net/xterm/xterm.log.html,
it seems that support for combining characters was added in
version 141 (2000/8/14).

Cheers,
Stéphane
