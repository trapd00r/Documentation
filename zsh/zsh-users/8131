    Hi all :)

    Sorry for self-replying....

    I did the wrong search in the mailing list archives, sorry. A
correct search gave zsh-users/6722 as an answer. I was almost sure I
had asked this question in the past (a year ago more or less), but
since I didn't find the message (due to the wrong search term), I
asked again. Sorry for the noise...
