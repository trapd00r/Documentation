Yes, I compile on 2.6 and it works on both 2.6 and 2.8.

I also compile on 2.8, and running on 2.6 shows an error like the one
your seeing.  I would therefore be worried your configuration is picking
up some `contamination' from 2.8 and you need to configure and compile
from scratch on a 2.6 machine; at least, I can't explain the result
otherwise.
