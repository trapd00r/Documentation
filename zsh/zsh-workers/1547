} 1. History bug:
} The magic-space binding seems to mess up the history of
} a line with a quoted argument that spawns two lines.

This is not a magic-space bug, specifically.  It happens any time
doexpandhist() is called on the second or later line of a command
that spans multiple lines.

} pride% echo 'a
} > b' c
} a
} b c
} pride% history
}     1  bindkey ' ' magic-space
}     2  history
}     3   c
}     4  history

But you can get the same thing with:

zsh[83] echo 'a
> b' c<TAB><RET>	<-- `c' menu-completes to `co'
a
b co
zsh[84] history -2
   82  history
   83   co
   84  history -2

Here's an even worse case; the command vanishes entirely:

zsh[85] echo 'a
> b'<TAB><RET>		<-- TAB moves cursor to beginning of line, then RET
a
b
zsh[85] history -4	<-- Note event number in prompt hasn't changed!
   81   c
   82  history
   83   co
   84  history -2
   85  history -4

I think the problem is with the "if (!err)" block near the end of
doexpandhist(), because it has a comment about resetting the cursor
to the beginning of line for vi mode.  However, I don't know enough
about how history works to want to mess with it.
