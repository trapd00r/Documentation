We all want this but you have eat a little bit if syntax pie!

Scrolling back in history (ESC) (Uparrow) and then reditting that line is the perhaps the easiest
way.
However

> mv !?saket<TAB>
Would bring up the whole line ready for a little editting

or purist

> mv !?saket?:*<tab>
Would just bring up the parameters

If you know the history number of the line (say 5) with desired parameters you can try

> !5:s/somefile1/somefile2/

and if you don't know the history number

!?saket?:s/somefile1/somefile2/

Have I missed anything? (I surely have!)
