That's not true any more:  all the module information comes from config.modules.
The remaining intermediate files are simply there to be included in C code.
It should be possible to rig up some code in the Makefile or an auxiliary
script to sort out which modules to provide documentation for along the same
lines as, say, the code in the top level Makefile which decides which functions
to install.
