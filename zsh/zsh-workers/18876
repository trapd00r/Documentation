It's an inevitable but unintended side effect of the way some
substitutions are done by the shell before it forks.  The list given in
subst.c is this one.

/* Do substitutions before fork. These are:
 *  - Process substitution: <(...), >(...), =(...)
 *  - Parameter substitution
 *  - Command substitution
 * Followed by
 *  - Quote removal
 *  - Brace expansion
 *  - Tilde and equals substitution
 */

My guess is this is left undefined by POSIX etc.  The stuff on pipelines
is fairly terse, but there might be something elsewhere since I didn't
look all that closely.

Where you would not want this to happen, and it doesn't, is if the
assignment immediately precedes a command.
