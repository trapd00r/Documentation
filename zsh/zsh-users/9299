    Hi Bart :)

    I've been trying this (without success):

    command $(printf '"%s "' $array) 

    The thing is that the 'printf' command prints the file names
exactly as I want them, within double quotes, but 'command' see those
double quotes... quoted. Any way of avoiding this? I think that it
may be a solution.

    I'm completely lost and I don't know how to make this script. The
only solution seems to be convert it to a shell function and use
'reply', but I need it to be able to be run as a command, not as a
function :(

    The worst thing is that I had the intention of using a couple
more scripts in this way, generating a list of files to work on and
dumping it to stdout :( but without being able to solve this
problem...
