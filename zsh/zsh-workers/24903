Not that I can see.  You can query the maximum number of colours, and there
are termlib and termcap sequences for setting a particular colour. I
haven't found a sequence for restoring the default, and no guarantee that
the termcap sequences, where supported, produce the same colours as the
ANSI ones in the same range, though it's probably a good bet.
