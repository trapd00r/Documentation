We can make $PATH more configurable, but I'm not sure I like the idea of
automatically adding something to an existing imported path, except in a
startup file.

Anyway, this doesn't fix the startup problem, of course, since the DLL is
searched for before we've touched the path.  I imagine bash works because
it's in the same directory.
