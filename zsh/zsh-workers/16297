These "few routines" are the heart of zsh ZLE :-) Remove them and half
of the zsh functionality is lost.

                             and I will make a suggestion: how about

zsg does not actually use either termcap or curses. It needs them only
to get terminal capabilities; for this it is using several termcap
functions that are emulates by curses as well.=20

curses module just provides convinient access to terminal capabilities
using curses names, no more.

There is no need to switch to slang. Either termcap or curses are
available on every system; slang is not. Given that we do not use any =
of
the features provided by slang (for that matter we do not use any of =
the
features provided by termcap or curses either :-) there is no reason to
use it.
