That's how all pipes work in all shells and scripting languages in all
variants of UNIX:  one process feeds its output to another process, so
one side of the pipe has to be forked as a separate process.  The only
question is which bits are forked off.

The only obvious alternative is the horrible method which used to be
used in MSDOS: fake separate processes by switching between the two
tasks; but we are certainly never going to have a task manager in the
shell when we have a proper multiprocessor operating system to do the
job more efficiently.

Just in case my explanation above hasn't made this remark obvious:
wrong in what way?  It's either that or no output at all.
