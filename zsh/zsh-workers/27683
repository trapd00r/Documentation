Hmm, yes, I can see that makes it relevant.  MONITOR wasn't really
designed to be dynamic, it just kind of evolved in a complex way like
everything else.

That *does* make a lot of sense, actually: if job control's turned off,
there's no point in half-pretending it isn't.  Disowning existing
background jobs at that point at least makes more sense than having them
come back in a zombified fashion.  I'll think about it tomorrow.
