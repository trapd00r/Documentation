System type? Didn't we have this kind of problem (a dynamically loaded 
module could not get at the symbols of another dynamically loaded
module) on SunOS4.x?

At least, the code should be ok: nbrbeg and nbrend are defined and
mod_export'ed in zle_tricky.c and zsh/complete depends upon zsh/zle.

Have you tried it with a linked in zsh/zle module?

Bye
 Sven
