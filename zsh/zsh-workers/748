:I want to announce that the release date of

:we should release something relatively soon.
:There is still much work I would like to

:probably make a new beta release every week
:to week-and-a-half.

Umm... yep... well, it was a good proposal... maybe when I get back from
the beach some of these new betas will be around (hopefully).
