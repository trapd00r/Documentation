Haven't investigated any further... the $compstate assoc contains an
element `unambiguous'. Maybe one of the recent changes to the
parameter code...?

And maybe we should add code to prevent the automatic name-dir
behaviour for assoc elements anyway (if we don't have that already and 
this is really the cause).
