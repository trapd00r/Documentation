Yep, that's exactly why I asked, there is an inconsistency.  Though, I'm not
volunteering to graft redirection and value/parameter onto the _comps or a
similar array.  Would have to be a job for someone else.

Though I would like to see better completion for redirection.  Redirection is
one of those situations where the file may not already exist, so better
guessing tricks would be useful.
