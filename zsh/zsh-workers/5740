Never having paid much attention to the discussion about completion (my
main interest being zsh as a programming language) I just tried it
anyway, and run into trouble with completion of shell parameters. After

	compctl -D -v

these commands are nicely completed:

	vared xyz<TAB>
	print $xyz<TAB>

But in the completion list of

	ls xyz<TAB>

all shell parameters starting with 'xyz' also show up, which IMHO is
nonsense. Any way to prevent this, and get parameter names completed
only if preceded by '$' or 'vared'?

Regards,
	Bernd
