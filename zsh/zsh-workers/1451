} ...but wouldn't it be better to say `eval $foo' in the example below?
} 
}  % eval $foo& jobs
}  [1] 884
}  [1]  + running    eval sleep 10

Hmm.  No, actually, I prefer it the way it is above.  If I change the
value of foo, seeing `eval $foo' doesn't tell me anything at all about
what's actually running.

In fact, I'd prefer it if the "eval" got stripped off so all that zsh
prints is `sleep 10'.  After all, "eval" is not a job; the thing that
was being eval'd is the job.
