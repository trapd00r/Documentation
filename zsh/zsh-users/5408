Thanks,

but I still think this is a bit confusing. Typing 'cd' and then
pressing ^Xh says 'tags in context :completion::complete:cd::', which
made me think that this was the actual context... What would be the
correct way of defining different (individual) completions for 'cd' and other 
commands?

Ok, I tried this but I didn't see any difference from the standard
completion... Could this have something to do with menu completion and
sorting? If so, how can I disable sorting? The problem is that I have
more than 10 named dirs, and more than 100 users, and 98% of the time I
want to complete for my named dirs.
