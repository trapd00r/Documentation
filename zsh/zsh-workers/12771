I vaguely remember having said something about this or something
similar but having been confused at that time (I don't remember when
that was either and can't offer a message number). However: yes, it is 
true. The code *does* compare the times for digest files, individual
zwc files and the original file (if they can be found). See the
function try_dump_file() in parse.c.
