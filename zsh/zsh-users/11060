You are likely to get some sort of error, possibly from cd, possibly
highly unexpected (try it if param* expands to two files, or not a
directory, for example) unless you actually test the expansion is a
single directory.  So you really need to be more careful.

local str
local -a dirs
for str in param param\* \*param \*param\*; do
  # Expands to all matching directories, else nothing.
  dirs=(${~str}(N/))
  if (( ${#dirs} == 1 )); then
    cd $dirs
    break
  fi
done
