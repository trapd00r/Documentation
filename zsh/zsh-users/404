If you have ``setopt equals'' set (it is by default) then

ls -l =perl<TAB>

will do it. 
<TAB> is normally bound to `expand-or-complete' with emacs bindings
or vi-insert-mode bindings.

>From zshexpn manual page:
`If  a word begins with an unquoted = and the EQUALS option'
`is set, the remainder of the word is taken as the name  of'
`a command or alias.  If a command exists by that name, the'
`word is replaced by the full pathname of the command.   If'
`an  alias  exists  by that name, the word is replaced with'
`the text of the alias.'
