Ah, that would explain why I'm sometimes surprised by what M-p
produces.  You're right, it's broken; I just hadn't really noticed
properly and found out what was broken.

If I type "ls foo<M-p>", I'm clearly looking for a line beginning with
"ls foo", not one beginning with "ls".

As you say, one solution would be a special mode, like the incremental
modes, which would remember what they were looking for. 

Another one---which I think I'd find acceptable---would be not to move
the cursor, so history-search-backward would always search for the
text before the cursor.  Or has that been tried, and people hated it?
