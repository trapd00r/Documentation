The script is running under bash, not zsh.  Bash (up to 3.x, anyway)
doesn't support floating point in that expression and gives you the
error you're seeing.  Make sure you've got the #!/bin/zsh (or whatever)
line atthe start of the script right.

(You shouldn't have to load anything special, however, arithmetic
expansion is a basic part of the shell.)
