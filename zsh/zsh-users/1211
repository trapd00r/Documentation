hello,

Somebody who is positioned to do so, please manually remove me
from the mailing list. My attempts have resulted in a succesful
"you've been removed" message, but I continue to receive messages.

If you don't understand or don't like this message, please ignore 
it. All flames will be summarily deleted.

Thanks,
