I came to the conclusion we had come to the limit of what we could easily
do with configure:  it's extremely uncomfortable for anything complicated,
and we keep getting requests for things that configure can't do.  It's
extremely hard to upgrade; the code is spread all over, the configure
options interact, and the active code is somewhere else entirely.  It's
hard to set up:  you end up fiddling with command line options and
rerunning configure.  Furthermore, it's horrible to write in comparison
with a shell-script-based system.  So I would like to remove the module
control stuff (which has appeared in the last couple of 3.1 releases) from
configure and do it as suggested --- set up a file based on the modules
that exist, and allow the installer to edit it.

The subtext is, if people would prefer a purely configure-based system it's
unlikely to be me that gets around to writing it any time in the
foreseeable future.
