According to the documentation (man zshbuiltins):

     The third form of pushd changes directory by rotating the
     directory list.

And then in Functions/Example/pushd, which unfortunately is not referenced 
in the User Contributions section of the manual, one finds:

# pushd function to emulate the old zsh behaviour.  With this function
# pushd +/-n just lifts the selected element to the top of the stack
# instead of just cycling the stack.
