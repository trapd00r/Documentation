Indeed.

OK. I suppose I was thinking that vared could easily be a streaming editor,
and read standard input slightly less blindly.

Fair.  But I want EOF to be EOF also in my vared-based `cat' emulator.

So at most, then, this should be an option for vared, and not a default.

I shall revamp my patch to be less intrusive, and not change any of the
current behaviour.
