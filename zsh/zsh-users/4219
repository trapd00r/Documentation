zsh 4.0.2
linux kernel 2.4.7
glibc 2.2.3
util-linux-2.11h
shadow-20001016

i don't use a pre-packaged distro, so i suppose you can consider the
system to be generic gnu/linux.

i use the login from the shadow package, so util-linux isn't the
problem. also, i have three other boxes with the exact config listed
above, and they work fine with zsh.

also, as i said, this problem happens *only* when i login as root, and
then only from a tty.

they do.
