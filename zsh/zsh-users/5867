Out of curiosity, why?

It can be done, but it requires forking a subshell, which may not make
it any faster than just generating the list of files to begin with:

if ( : *(Ne:exit 0:) ; exit 1 )
then
  print There are some files in this directory
else
  print There are no files in this directory
fi
