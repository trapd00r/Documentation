It should be cycling through the completions in alphabetical order.

It's possible with the new function-based completion system in 3.1.6
and later, but not in 3.0.anything or earlier.  But it's not what I'd
call straightforward even in the new system.

If you have 3.1.6, you might want to try using "menu selection" instead
of menu completion; see the documentation for the zsh/complist module.
