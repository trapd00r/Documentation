I've been using zsh MAILPATH to check various files for quite some
time now, and have had no problems with it.  Here is the relevant
portion of my .zprofile file:

# How often to check for mail, and where to check.
MAIL=$HOME/Mail/inbox/mbox
MAILCHECK=120
MAILPATH="$MAIL?You have new mail"
MAILPATH="$MAILPATH:/usr/mail/?Someone has mail in /usr/mail/"
MAILPATH="$MAILPATH:$HOME/dead.letter?You have a dead letter"
MAILPATH="$MAILPATH:/tmp/post.messages?You have a post note"
