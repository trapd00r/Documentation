I can reproduce such a crash reliably with:

% unset SHLVL
% (( SHLVL-- ))
BUG: parameter not created
zsh: segmentation fault (core dumped)  ./zsh

This probably doesn't involve the line in exec.c, but it's almost certainly
the same root, so it'll give something to work on.  (The BUG message only
appears if configured with --enable-zsh-debug.)
