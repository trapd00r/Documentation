On the whole, I'm not expecting much to be added to the old-style
completion functions.  I realise it's hard to write new ones from scratch
and we should include a minimal description and pointers of what else to
read.

If anyone does want to add new compctl examples, which doesn't hurt, could
they please send patches, it makes life much easier (more work for them, of
course).
