I recently had problems compiling zsh on HP-UX 10.20, related to makepro.sed. 
I checked in Etc/MACHINES, and sure enough, the problem was documented. I
did a search on patches for sed on HP-UX 10.20, and found one that fixes
the problem. The most recent sed patch is PHCO_12862. It can be downloaded 
from these places:
