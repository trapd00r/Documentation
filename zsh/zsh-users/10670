Assuming that variables are assigned in the following way:

  x=3Dabc
  y=3Ddef
  z=3D'$x   $y' # Note: Single Quotes!

How could I write an expression, which "evaluates" $z, in
that it would return "abc   def"? The simple

   eval "echo $z"=20

would not work here, because it would not
preserve the spaces.

   eval "echo \"$z\""

would indeed do the job, but I consider this a very ugly
solution because of the nested quoting. Does anyone know=20
a more elegant alternative?
