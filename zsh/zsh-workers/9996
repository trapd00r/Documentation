Subject: push-input, accept-and-hold, etc., and vared
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Using push-input or accept-and-hold during vared has unexpected (to me,
at least) behavior -- to wit, the value of the variable is pushed onto
the command input stack, and vared exits, whereupon the value of the
variable is immediately popped into the PS1 editor buffer.

There may be obscure circumstances in which this is what is meant, but
(particularly in the case of "vared mapfile[...]") that's seldom so.

I'm not precisely sure what to suggest we do about it, though.  It might
be nice to have accept-and-hold set the variable but not exit vared (this
would be particularly useful with "vared mapfile[...]").  I'm at a loss
with respect to push-input and friends.  Perhaps they just shouldn't work?

On a semi-related question, is it time that vared had its own keymap?
The problem is initializing it properly, I suppose.
