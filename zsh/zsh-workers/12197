I can reproduce it with completely vanilla new completion, but it's weirder
than I said: it only happens when there is a unique match for the file in
question (which may explain why I needed to type the first character).
This seems to be completely reproducible and as far as I can see not style
dependent.  It may be related to the fact that the `+' doesn't get inserted
in this case.
