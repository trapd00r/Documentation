On the second thought, they are not. The presence of declaration in headers
does not mean declared object is actually present (it may be declared "for
internal use only"); conversely, there are (normally) many undeclared
functions in system libraries. Any package that wants to be on safe side must
check both for object *and* its declaration. Downside is, of course, without
object declaration you never know if your usage of it is correct :-)
