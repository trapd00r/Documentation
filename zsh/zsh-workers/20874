I did apply the patch. Compilation was OK but make check issued the 
following error:

Test ./C02cond.ztst failed: bad status 1, expected 0 from:
   sleep 1
   cat unmodified
   touch newnewnew
   if [[ $OSTYPE == "cygwin" ]]; then
     print -u8 "Warning: not testing [[ -N file ]] (not supported on Cygwin)"
     true
   else
     [[ -N newnewnew && ! -N unmodified ]]
   fi
Was testing: -N cond
./C02cond.ztst: test failed.


I installed nevertheless and it seems to run OK.

Thank you for you help.
