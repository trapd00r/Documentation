} I think that the right one is "". Though if I type \Cv \My the echo
} is:
} (escape y)
} which makes me to belive that my alt key is working ok (by prefixing the
} key with an escape char).

Alt-y should generate one 8-bit character for the \C\My binding to work
correctly.  On my system Alt-y is \371 (ù), and Ctrl-Alt-y is \231 (™).

Anytime a key generates a two- character or longer sequence, you have to
spell it out explicitly in the bindkey command.  I'm -guessing- that you
use xterm mappings to get ESC y from Alt-y, but that you haven't made a
mapping for Ctrl-Alt-y, and that therefore xterm sends plain y on that
combination.
