Hi list
this is my first message.
i haven't been using UNIX stuff for very long since i'm a mac user. But 
with Mac OS X, it was the time to start ;-)
Anyway, i've heard about the different shells and even if i don't 
really know the others, i believe zsh is a very good one (completion, 
loops, etc ...)

that's why i would like one more feature to make it even better. utf-8 
support. after reading the list archive, i've seen that utf-8 is not 
yet supported in zsh 4.1.1. but i've also seen that zsh 4.2 is in alpha 
4 stage.

so i've got 2 questions :
- will zsh 4.2 will have utf-8 support
- when do you expect it to be available ? ;-) (answer not compulsory 
...)

i'm doing translation stuff with vim and i'd like my shell to fully 
handle utf-8 for more consistency in my settings.

thank you guys
julien
