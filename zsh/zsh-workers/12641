If you can see how to do that easily via the current cygwin configuration
tests, send a patch and I will commit the appropriate bits (probably only
zsh.rc and zsh.ico would be needed, resources.c is just a dummy file to
make it look like a normal library module and the module header can be
removed if the dependencies are going into the makefile).
