hmm ...

function _foo {
	_files -W /some/directory
}
compadd _foo commandname

does it work?

And doing it automatically:

echo > ~/functions/_foo << EOF
#compadd commandname
_files -W /some/directory
EOF

fpath=($fpath ~/functions)
compinit

the last part obviously goes into .zshrc or whatever. Try running
compinstall as well.
