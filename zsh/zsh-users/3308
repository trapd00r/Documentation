hi marvelous list :)

I am looking for completions for GNU-tools which are not part of
the 3.1.9 source. one completion which i would like is for GNU
color ls, then for screen and setterm. btw i use SUSE 6.2 linux right
now but i guess "for current GNU" should tell enough, right?.
I am studying on doing completions myself but right now i had no
luck with the attempts i tried, mercy :) I still want to
understand how to do it but other things have to be learned and
done, too.

Matthias
