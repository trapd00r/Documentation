} Well what I am completing is SQL.

Sorry, I don't think you're ever going to get this to work as you want it
to, and I don't think Sven should expend any effort on making it work.

The completion system's understanding of quoting is by necessity tightly
tied to shell quoting syntax.  SQL quoting syntax is not equivalent, and
the internals of zsh should not be in the business of understanding the
syntax of other languages.
