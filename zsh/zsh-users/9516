    Well, yes, I've deduced that ;) I don't really know why, anyway

    Because I don't want to mess with the terminal just to avoid some
\C-M characters that can be eliminated using a simple shell
substitution. Using STTY in the "zpty" command is more convenient
than the substitution, using "stty" in the whole script is not.

    I can use ttyctl, too. That's not the problem (but anyway thanks
a lot for the idea), I just was curious about the STTY behaviour. I'm
not sure whether that's a desired behaviour.
