Hi,

 there are several kind of commands -- mainly things like "rm" --
 which may be harmless only in a certain context.

 The history function of zsh remembers the command but not the
 contents.

 Therefore one may look up (for example via ^R) the history and gives
 a "go" to a command, which he _really_ does not want by accident.

 Is it possible to write a "something" to filter out certain commands 
 or to modify certain commands before they were copied from the
 commandline into the history ?

 Kind regards and keep hacking!
