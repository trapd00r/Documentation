Did you try gzexe (comes standard with gzip)?  Its man page says:

[...]

NAME
       gzexe - compress executable files in place

DESCRIPTION
       The  gzexe  utility  allows you to compress executables in
       place and have them automatically uncompress  and  execute
       when  you  run  them  (at  a penalty in performance).  For
       example if you execute ``gzexe /bin/cat'' it  will  create
       the following two files:
           -r-xr-xr-x  1 root  bin   9644 Feb 11 11:16 /bin/cat
           -r-xr-xr-x  1 bin   bin  24576 Nov 23 13:21 /bin/cat~
       /bin/cat~  is  the original file and /bin/cat is the self-
       uncompressing executable file.  You can  remove  /bin/cat~
       once you are sure that /bin/cat works properly.

       This  utility  is  most  useful on systems with very small
       disks.
