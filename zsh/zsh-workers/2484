Because vi doesn't bind them, and because <ESC> already has a meaning
that its use as a prefix would interfere with.

It'll work as expected.

Yes, just bind them using bindkey.

I also use nvi, and those bindings really piss me off.  Especially
because I can't disable them (except by hacking the source).

Have you tried using this binding after you gave i a count?  Look at
what that binding does; it's a disgusting kludge.  In ZLE it wouldn't
be kludged, but it would still be wrong.
