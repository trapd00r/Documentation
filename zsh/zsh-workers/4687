Typing away merrily, Peter Stephenson produced the immortal words:

Oh good.  That's two things that I've gotten right lately.  Maybe I can
keep up the winning streak.

How about a parenthesised paragraph, along the lines of:
( If you want a simple life, skip this paragraph.  As an example of the
  power of zsh expansion, $==* is $* with shwordsplit explicitly turned
  off for that one expansion, whilst $=* explicitly turns shwordsplit
  on, effectively acting like the Bourne shell's $* )

but reworded to be clearer.  I'm not good at prose.
