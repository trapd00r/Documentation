Subject: use 'P' parameter expansion flag with array?

If the 'P' parameter expansion flag is applied to an array parameter,
should it be applied to each of the elements?  Seems like it should,
but it doesn't seem to be:


[~] greg@lwm| zsh -f
lwm% 
lwm% echo $ZSH_VERSION
4.3.10-dev-1
lwm% foo=(bar baz)
lwm% bar=10
lwm% baz=35
lwm% echo ${(P)foo}
10
lwm% echo ${(P@)foo}
10
lwm% echo ${(P)foo[@]}
10
lwm% 


thanks,
Greg
