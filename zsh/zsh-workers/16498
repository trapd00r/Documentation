Subject: [tbm@cyrius.com: Bug#130817: zsh's echo doesn't error if device is full]

I tried putting some error-checking in bin_print, but it didn't seem to
make much difference.

zsh's echo should print an error when it fails because the device is
full.


1250:tbm@fisch: ~] /bin/echo foo > b
/bin/echo: write error: No space left on device

zsh: exit 1     /bin/echo foo > b
1251:tbm@fisch: ~] echo foo > b
