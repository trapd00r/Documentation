Hi,

on Mac OS X 10.3.9, installation worked well except for error messages 
in
make install.info

info files were installed in
/usr/local/info/
but there was no zsh entry in the info directory.

I had to run
install-info zsh.info
in order to make zsh appear in the info directory.

I hope this helps.

Thanks.
