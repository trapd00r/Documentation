This has me perplexed. I have a small program, attached below, which
does little more than a gethostbyname() call.

I compile it *statically* under SunOS 4.1.3, using either acc or gcc,
and attempt to run it under Solaris 2.5.1.

It works OK for any standard /bin/sh or /bin/csh login.  If however I
use an account with /usr/local/bin/zsh (3.0.5) as the login (/etc/passwd)
shell, it hangs in the gethostbyname() call.

Further investigation using subshells from a /bin/csh login reveals:

su <zsh> : OK
zsh -l : OK
su - <zsh> : hangs

Having got into a "hang" configuration, su - <csh> *doesn't* reverse
back into a working state.

Those four pieces of evidence seem to rule out the problem as being in
the environment or the zlogin file?

Other info:  I'm unaware of anything needed to "authorize" zsh (a la
e.g. /etc/shells under some BSD-like environments).  Vanilla 3.0.5
compilation (except for my vared patch sent to the list a week or
two ago).  Nothing in zlogin except for an stty config line.

Where does one start looking here?
