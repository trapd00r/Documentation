Arrow keys don't properly `work' in insert mode in *any* vi, since there
is no such thing as an insert `mode'.

You can do much the same thing with zsh:

bindkey -s "^[[A" "^[k"
bindkey -s "^[[B" "^[j"
bindkey -s "^[[C" "^[l"
bindkey -s "^[[D" "^[h"

bindkey -s acts like vi's map command.  The recent betas can do this
in a slightly better way, but I think this is exactly the functionality
you're looking for.
