I've thought about sticking a highlighted status line on the last line
of a vt100 or xterm which would contain handy info like PWD, but I
could never figure out how. Could you be more specific about what you
mention below? I've never programmed a terminal before and I'm not
sure what you mean by games with the "termcap sequences".

thanks
