Just to be clear: do you need *exactly* xpath syntax, as given above?
If so, then the answer is no: this conflicts with ordinary shell syntax
where [...] specifies a character class and since any set of characters
can appear within it there's no way of interpreting it any other way.
Or are you happy with something that looks a bit like xpath syntax, and
can be converted (possibly automatically) into it?  If the latter, we
could probably come up with something using shell functions and glob
qualifiers.
