i consider that more of a bug-prevention option than i security option, 
although it certainly can have security related implications.

maybe... but it can do a lot more than most people think. like find, it's 
one of the more awkward and unintuitive commands.

================

i consider my command-line skills and scripting skills to reinforce each 
other, so i don't mind doing strange things (aka things i've never done 
before, or things that are hard to type) in one setting, because i will 
take that with me to the other setting.

this last point is especially true with zsh, since it blows away all other 
shells at doing things on the command line spanning multiple lines.
