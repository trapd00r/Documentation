You seem to be thinking about the variables in the opposite manner in
which they were intended.  The _options_set variable contains set
options (not options that can be set), so it is used to complete
unsettable options in _unsetopt.  I think this interpretation of the
options is evident in this comment in _main_complete:

    # If you want to complete only set or unset options for the unsetopt
    # and setopt builtin, un-comment these lines:

This is followed by _options_set (the set options) and _options_unset
(the unset options).  Certainly, your choice to reverse the meaning in
both the setting and use of these variables will work fine for your
configuration, but I think the CVS version should remain unchanged.
