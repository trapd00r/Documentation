} I would have expected ${FOO/(#s)/X} and ${${FOO/(#m)(#s)?/X$MATCH}:-X}

AFAICT, it's because "start of string" is considered to begin with the
first real character, thus after the implicit intial empty substring.

This should probably be considered a bug.

Compare ${FOO/()/X}, and also ${FOO//()/X} ...
