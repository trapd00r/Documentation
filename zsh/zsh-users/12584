Subject: read -s doesn't work with -t?

I'm trying to do something silly with mouse reporting mode, and I
don't want zsh to echo the stuff to the terminal, but I also don't
want to block until I click the mouse, so read -s fulfills the first
criteria while read -t 60 fulfills the second one. However, when I
give read -s -t 60, the -s seems to be ignored. Bug or feature? Either
way it seems to be undocumented, the entry for read mentions -s does
not work with -q, but -t is not -q.
