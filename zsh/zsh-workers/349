If you're using the zsh line editor, you need to make sure anything
you want with local echoing gets called before the next prompt.

stty -echo; read foo

works.

This is possibly a bug because zsh is supposed to keep its own tty
settings separate from the ones with which it calls external
programmes, but it does do some sanitation.
