} I write to report failure of zsh-3.1.9 to build on Linux with
} kernel 2.4-test1, glibc-2.1.2, gcc-2.95.2.  This failure is
} redeemed by a simple but heavy-handed hack in config.h.

This is already discussed in Etc/MACHINES:

        Some versions of glibc2 have a conflict with <asm/resource.h>
        which causes a redefinition warning on RLIM_INFINITY.  This
        causes configure to decide that <sys/resource.h> is not present,
        which can cause compilation errors in zsh's rlimit code.  The
        best solution is to edit config.h after running configure and
        #define HAS_SYS_RESOURCE_H.
