On Nextstep3.2 commands similar to:

        zsh-3.0.2> rsh remotehost cat somefile | wc

hang. After ^C is hit, the shell prints:

        [1]    suspended (tty input)  rsh remotehost cat somefile |
               interrupt              wc

This only happens when the rsh-output is piped into the local command.

        zsh-3.0.2> rsh remotehost cat somefile </dev/null | wc
        zsh-3.0.2> rsh -n remotehost cat somefile | wc
        zsh-3.0.2> rsh remotehost cat somefile

are ok. Also unsetopt monitor helps.

I checked the same with zsh-3.0.2 on Linux-2.0 and Osf3.2, there are no
such problems on both of them, even when remotehost is the Next.

What now? Enable RSH_BUG_WORKAROUND? But that's for the other side, as
I understand it??

Clueless, Wolfgang.   (Hints appreciated.)
