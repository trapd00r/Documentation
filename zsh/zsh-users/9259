Hi all,

I find the 'correctall' option to be useful in most cases, except for  
the case described below.

zsh% ls
foo1 foo2 foo3
zsh% cp foo3 foo4
zsh: correct 'foo4' to 'foo3'? [nyae] n

The same thing happens for the mv command.

zsh% mv foo3 foo4
zsh: correct 'foo4' to 'foo3'? [nyae] n

I wouldn't want to be asked for the correction as long as foo4  
doesn't exist.  Is there a way to customize this so that only the  
first file is checked when the command is cp or mv?

Suggestions are greatly appreciated.

Wataru Kagawa
