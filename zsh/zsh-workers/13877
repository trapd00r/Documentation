I did cvs up, make make install and got after starting new zsh:

bor@itsrm2% zsh
/home/bor/.zcompletion:16: compinit: function definition file not found
/home/bor/.zcompletion:41: command not found: compdef
bor@itsrm2% echo $fpath

Looks like default fpath was not changed in Makefiles? The init.c (at least)
was recompiled.
