Sorry Bart for provoking such an elaborate response from you :).  I understand
that, I just had some strange mixture of expectations in my mind
(partially based on beliving in word splitting on white space characters).
I think I got it correct by now and there were no more problems during
transition so I'm now using zsh in all systems I have access to :)).
