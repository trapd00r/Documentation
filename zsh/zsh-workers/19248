    Yes ;))

    Me too! But certainly I can't live without it ;)

    And it shouldn't... How about taking it from a environment
variable? I mean, this way you can use the help shipped with zsh, or
other if you want to.

    IMHO, and taking into account that I don't decide, of course, is
a very good idea... Anyway, this can be implemented in a shell
function, is not necessary doing that in a builtin...
