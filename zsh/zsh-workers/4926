Oh, well, that's because my patch only filters out "PWD".  You're right
that it probably ought to filter "OLDPWD" as well.

Actually, it's probably the case that no parameter set automatically by
the shell should ever be subject to autonamedirs.  Unfortunately, there's
no existing list of such parameters built into the code.
