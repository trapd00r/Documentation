I can't find anything about this in zsh-3.0.0/etc/FAQ or zsh-3.0.0/etc/BUGS
so I'm assuming it's fairly new.

zsh% function foo { echo $1 ; cat $1 }
zsh% foo =(echo hello world)
/tmp/zsha24295
cat: /tmp/zsha24295: No such file or directory

The temp file for the process substitution seems to be getting removed a bit
too aggressively.  It should stay around at least until the shell function
finishes, should it not?
