After I press TAB the second time and automenu starts, it is directly after
Makefile.
And I mean the case, when I press SPACE after that, exiting current
completion. In this case cursor is after inserted space.

I must admit, I don't remember, when it changed. I started with late 2.x
beta, some time before version number was changed to 3.0.0. I never played
with bindkey for space. But I remember my surprise when I first have seen
list not disappearing. And I think, I even sent a message to this list at
this time ... gotta make a search ... no, sigh ... Hmmm about bindkey ...
there was large change in zle by Zefram. May it be, that some default
bindings changed at that time?

Well, this question actually belongs to zsh-users. I vote for clearing the
list :-)
