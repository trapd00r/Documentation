 Which begs the question, who's working on the C compiler ?:)

ObZsh: Would it be possible to have a statically linked sys-admin
shell built as part of the build process. Then you could literally
just have it[1] on a floppy and boot Linux with init=/bin/zsh_admin.

probably want vi and fsck too ... but not much more).
