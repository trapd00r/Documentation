Hi all,

Is there any way of performing completion of words from history based
on a substring rather than a prefix?  For example, if the word
`/usr/src/linux-2.4/Documentation/networking/netdevices.txt' is in the
history, I would like to be able to retrieve it by referring to it as
`Doc' or `2.4'.  Ideally, it would be retrievable incrementally in the
same way as C-r fetches whole lines.  Incidentally, as some of you may
have already guessed, the inspiration for this is iswitchb
buffer-switching in emacs.

Adam
