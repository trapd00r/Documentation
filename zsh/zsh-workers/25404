See for instance kill(1). To kill a process group, you have to
do:

kill -- -<pid>

So you'd have to do

return -- -3

-- is not a valid math expression, so changing return -- so that
it is the same as "return" instead of giving an error message
shouldn't be a problem.

Changing return -1 so that it outputs an error message instead
of returning with $? == -1 could break existing scripts.

BTW, is this:

$ zsh -c '(){echo test;return 1}; echo $?'
test
0

the expected output?
