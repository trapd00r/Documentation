Subject: arrays and spaces in file names?
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1; format=flowed
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
From: reckoner <sam.reckoner@gmail.com>

I want to do something like

% names=(`find . -print`)

and then something like

% for i in names do;...;done

The problem is that some of the filenames have spaces in them and the 
array elements split on these spaces. I read the manpage and can't make 
sense of what to do w/ this.

Help?

Thanks.
