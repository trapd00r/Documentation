Yes, but not unmodified using a SysV sh.

The bug is in configure{,.in}.  It doesn't handle echo translating '\\'
to '\'.  The very simplest solution is to use zsh or bash to configure.
Do either

	$ bash ./configure ...

or, from zsh,

	% ARGV0=sh zsh ./configure ...

This will be fixed in the next release, which, considering the seriousness
of this particular problem, will probably be fairly soon.
