Hi, 

You'll find zsh for Win95/NT in
 ftp://ftp.blarg.net:/users/amol/zsh/ .

  I've once tried them on my Win95 of Japanese version.  Forgot my
reason why I've thrown away, but later someone on this list said they
work well. Maybe the trouble I had was something specific with
Japanese environment or maybe had been improved as the revison number
increased.

Tell me how good it was when you have tested.
