Hello world,

Found in zsh man

${NAME:=WORD}
${NAME::=WORD}
     In the first form, if NAME is unset or is null then set it to
     WORD; in the second form, unconditionally set NAME to WORD.  In
     both forms, the value of the parameter is then substituted.


echo ${pwd::=pw3Pwe7}

works fine but

echo ${pwd::="$( pwd/Next)"}

failed. Is there a way to make it run ?

regards
mc
