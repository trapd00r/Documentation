Sorry, but you're remembering wrongly.  That's not how the GPL works.
You can't rely on someone else to distribute the sources for you.  That's
what you'd be doing if you pointed to a Red Hat site for cygwin.

It seems like every single person who wants to use a Cygwin-derived
binary wants things work like that, but it doesn't.

I hate to say this, but if you are releasing binaries you must also
make sources available for every GPLed component.  If you built zsh
with cygwin then it is "infected" with the GPL.

Btw, I'm the Cygwin Engineering Manager for Red Hat.  I've been over
this many times with very many people.

Usually, after I try to tell someone that this isn't how the GPL works,
they tell me that the are good "Open Source" developers and wonder why
I'm picking on them.  I am not saying that I advocate this or that it
is the perfect way to distribute cygwin.  I'm just saying that this
is what the GPL dictates.

IANAL, yaddda, yadda...
