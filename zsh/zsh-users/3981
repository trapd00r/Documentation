Subject: [4.0.2 bug] commands not written to history
Message-ID: <20010629163348.A9632@greux.loria.fr>
Mail-Followup-To: zsh-users@sunsite.dk

I sometimes write related commands like

$ cmd1
$ cmd2

And several hours/days later, I can recall cmd1 from the history and
type ^O to recall cmd2 automatically. I don't want to do that in a
script or in a function, to have full control on these commands (and
be able to insert commands between cmd1 and cmd2 if need be).

But sometimes (difficult to say under which conditions), a copy of cmd1
had been written to the history (as expected), but there is no copy of
cmd2. That is, ^O gives me another command (instead of cmd2).

Here are my history options:

greux:~> setopt|grep hist                                             <16:29:44
extendedhistory
histignoredups
histignorespace
histnofunctions
histnostore
histreduceblanks
incappendhistory
greux:~> unsetopt|grep hist                                           <16:29:46
noappendhistory
nobanghist
cshjunkiehistory
histallowclobber
nohistbeep
histexpiredupsfirst
histfindnodups
histignorealldups
histsavenodups
histverify
sharehistory

I reported a similar problem for zsh 3.1.9 in November (message-id of
the first mail: <20001129141451.A24159@lepois.loria.fr>). And I got a
reply saying:

--------
IIRC, this bug was fixed back in July:

2000-07-17  Wayne Davison  <wayned@users.sourceforge.net>

        * 12265: Src/hist.c: Fixed gethistent().

In the case you cite, the gethistent() function would sometimes fail when
called from savehistfile().
--------

I don't know if this is related...
