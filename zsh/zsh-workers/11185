This updates the contributors for 3.1.7.  It's a bit devisive sticking some
people in `other patches' at the end, but the point was simply to identify
anyone who's contributed to particular parts of the shell.  I put it in
alphabetical order this time.  Tanaka Akira is under `T', I hope that's
right: I realise there are two ways of transforming Japanese names, either
westernise the order or not.  I never got around to asking before...

If anyone spots anything else in the source tree documentation, now is the
time to mention it.  Some changes to Etc/MACHINES are probably warranted,
including compilations of distributions such as Debian and Mandrake on
multiple architectures.  Even if it works flawlessly, it's good to mention
it so that people are prompted to report any problems if it later stops
working (in theory).
