I can confirm, works fine for me.

Awesome, this works as well !


For now I will just write down all the possibilities you showed
me, and since I don't know which one is better,
I will stick with the following suggestion

# from the zsh-user, Bart Schaefer:
bindkey "^W" backward-kill-word    # vi-backward-kill-word
bindkey "^H" backward-delete-char  # vi-backward-delete-char
bindkey "^U" backward-kill-line    # vi-kill-line
bindkey "^?" backward-delete-char  # vi-backward-delete-char

Thanks for your help !
