Yup.

larch is a) known buggy, b) not supported upstream, c) superseded - tla
(& anything branched from it) is a superset of larch functionality.

They are roughly the same, but there are some key differences - for
starters the UI's are quite different, and that gap is growing as we
overhaul the UI in baz. There may be model changes in the future -
though we do want to minimise those. I'm quite happy if the completions
are merged... but baz is a moving target (monthly releases...).

Bazaar has a very strong UI focus, but is also has a custom archive
format that we hope will enable greater flexability in time. We are
talking with upstream (tla) in the hopes that they will adopt what we do
(or a lookalike :)).

Cheers,
