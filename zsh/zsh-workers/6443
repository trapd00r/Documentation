Subject: PATCH: 3.0.6-pre-3: documentation fixes
Date: Wed, 02 Jun 1999 21:10:13 -0700
From: Wayne Davison <wayne@clari.net>

Here's some doc fixes for 3.0.6-pre-3:

+ Some tt(FOO) entities were used in zshbuiltins.man, so I changed
  them to be \fBFOO\fP.

+ I documented my change to EXTENDED_HISTORY's output format.

+ I added the missing doc for HIST_REDUCE_BLANKS.
