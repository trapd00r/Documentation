Gee, it's hard to have these discussions when the rest of you are all
seven to nine hours ahead of me.

} Or hit ^Xh (control-x h) and it will tell you (the `tags').

Specifically, type the thing you want to complete after, then hit <C-x h>=
=2E

For some reason I was thinking the tags only showed up in the verbose
output, but it's the _styles_ that you can get with <ESC 2 C-x h>.

You want simple, or you want programmable?

That approach was designed to make it easy to use your existing GNU "ls"
color options for coloring files in zsh.  Easy for one thing, hard for
some others.

I think Matthias was referring to the colon-separated-list of attr=3Dval
pairs where the val is a series of semicolon-seprated numbers, rather
than to the entire zstyle mechanism.  Though I admit contexts can look
a little daunting as well.

That's just because GNU "ls" predefined the tokens for file types ahead
of us, and we borrowed them.  We wanted to use something less cryptic
(i.e., the group names in parens) for zsh competion "types."

I think you can see why it reminds you of "ls".
