Yes, it ought to do just that.  In fact, if you use standard colon-path
syntax,

compctl -/ -W $CDPATH cd

or if you use space-separated words (this is currently built into -g,
actually, though I suspect not a lot of people know that),

compctl -/ -W "$cdpath" cd

which is quite a good argument for (eventually) implementing it.
(I've oversimplified, you need a '-x "S[/][~]" -/ --' as well, since -W
hijacks everything.)
