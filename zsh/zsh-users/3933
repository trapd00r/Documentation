Bart already pointed you to the new completion system.

If, for some reason, you can't use that, the way to make completion with
compctl accept `..' as a possible match (which in turn makes it add the
slash) is to add `-g ".."' to all your compctl's that generate filenames
as possible matches (using the -f, -/ or -g options -- in the last case
you can just add the `..' to -g's already existing argument).
