Almost. I'm trying to write completions for Solaris proc commands. Most
of them can operate on PIDs or core files. I set to writing my own
completions when zsh didn't want to complete core files. I know I can
bind a key to force file completion, but that should work out of the
box.

I also wanted to complete process list based on privileges the user has,
but privileges don't seem to be usable for this. It's still mostly root
or ordinary user.
