    Sorry, I forgot that O:) Anyway, by now I'm testing a solution
using select and a little sed script to munge the text, script that I
don't know if it can be replaced by shell code, I will try in the
future but since I'm certainly not a sed guru nor a shell guru FWIW,
I will need some more help. The important point is that it works now,
no matter if it is not the most elegant piece of code in the world.

    Thanks for all :)
