We've patched for this for ages (there's even a " @c Note to RedHat:
Do NOT change this to @{@}.  It really should be @'@'."  in there.)

The fix to this is to replace

@set dsq @'@'

with 

@set dsq ''

Someone else obviously thinks different, but I would like to know why:
What you ship does not work.
