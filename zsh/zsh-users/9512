    Hi all :)

    In a shell script, this command:

    STTY=-onlcr stty -a

    doesn't have the desired effect (it doesn't deactivate onlcr). It
has to do with the INTERACTIVE option, because if the bangpath in the
script is "#!/bin/zsh -i" instead of the usual "#!/bin/zsh", it
works. Is it my fault,a desired behaviour or a bug?

    I was testing Bart's suggestion for my problematic "zpty" command
and I found that, after succesfully testing in the command line, it
didn't work in the script. I tried to change a couple of options that
may be slightly related with the terminal but it was "INTERACTIVE"
who made it work. Since I cannot "setopt interactive" within a
script, the only way is to change the bangpath.

    Thanks in advance :)
