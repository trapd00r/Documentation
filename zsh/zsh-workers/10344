Sounds a bit like the "endless spaces" refresh bug, which was fixed in
one of the recent dev releases.  (Funnily enough, I ran into that bug
myself a few days after it was reported here, on an HP-UX system.)

Anyway, basically you can't expect a zsh compiled for one OS to run
on another.  I wouldn't attempt to port a binary from 10.20 to 11:
they're different in so many details that you really should have a
separate binary.  (At the place where I was using HP-UX, I had separate
binaries for 10.10, 10.20 and 11.  Plus Solaris 2.5 and 2.6 and AIX,
but of course they *really* need separate binaries.)
