One (tiny) problem I have found with zsh-2.6-beta9 (as well as
zsh-2.6-beta9-hzoli9) is that when I "su" to a new user, $USERNAME stays
the same as the person I initially logged in as ($LOGNAME). Previous
version of zsh (zsh-2.6-beta8) correctly change $USERNAME when I "su".

As a result, prompt="%n>" will not display the correct username.

(btw: zsh is great, I really appreciate all the efforts...)

thank you
