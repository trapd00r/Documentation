I just got zsh-3.0.4 to coredump,

  zsh: 26833 segmentation fault (core dumped)  zsh -f

by doing the following,

  (1) zsh -f
  (2) ls /usr/local/x11r6/contrib/programs/gs/gs5.03/*.ps<TAB>
  (3) The bazillion (or so) *.ps files get expanded. This fills up
      more than a screen of text
  (4) Tried to undo via "^Xu", and got the corefile:

I realize this is pretty useless debugging info, but perhaps this has
already been fixed by one of the patches I missed.

If not, I'll try to build a version with full debug info later.

Oh, BTW, this is,

  suomi$ uname -a
  SunOS suomi 5.5 Generic_103093-12 sun4m sparc SUNW,SPARCstation-10
  suomi$ cc -V
