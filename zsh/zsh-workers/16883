I have been thinking about it before, just some comments

- I hoped to create implementation that would share configure cache and
make is possible to list help from every module's configure script =
using
top-level configure --help and pass parameters to every module's
configure script using top-level configure. Using stock autoconf it is
possible only with fixed number of sub-scripts; but may be it is enough
(we may distribute zsh in this way and for developers additional script
that would create needed definitions for modules).

- linking shared object with dynamic library is not portable. May be it
works on every modern system nowadays, I do not know.=20
