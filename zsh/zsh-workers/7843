Hi,

I compiled zsh 3.0.6 and 3.1.6 under Solaris 2.6.

However when I run it I get the following error :

$ ./zsh
zsh: fatal error: out of memory

I've tried the various memory options at the configure stage without
success. 

I've tried compiling with the SUN compiler v4.2 and the GNU C compiler
v2.8.1. Both have this problem.

Any information/help would be appreciated.

Regards,
Anthony.
