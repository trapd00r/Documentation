} I'll have another go at getting through to Karsten. He was very

I'd be happy to provide advice on setting up SpamAssassin.  Legitimate
mail to zsh-* typically scores less than 1.5, whereas spam to these
lists usually scores more than 13 (though I have had a couple in the
5.5 to 7 range, and one at 9.8).

For an effective procmail virus trap, see

(and yes, I know virii isn't really the plural).
