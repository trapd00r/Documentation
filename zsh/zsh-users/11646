If you're using the standard ("new", a few years back) completion
system then all return values for any completion, in any context, are
returned by shell functions; there are many examples of completions
which come from calling a command and some of those use shell
associative arrays to cache the results.

Read through zshcompsys(1) for more information.

I guess doing something with _directories() is the way to go if you want
to change the concept of a directory for all tab-completion, but I'm not
very good with the completion system.
