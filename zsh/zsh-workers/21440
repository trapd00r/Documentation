As I outlined earlier, such simple changes as putting bold text in the
prompt would
be immediatly useful. Most of my friends don't even customize their prompt,
requiring them to clear their screen between invocations of commands that o=
utput
lots of text. Why not Do The Right Thing? Why not make it work right
out of the box?

I disagree. I think they should do whatever they can, so everyone else
doesn't have to.

So it shouldn't be done? Do you think most new zsh converts-to-be (maybe) a=
re
going to spend the time with the extremely complex and comprehensive
completion system to set it up? Only the most die-hard customizers will do =
this.

And yes, good defaults are 'hard.' That's life. Usability is hard.
There's no two ways
about it. But that doesn't mean it shouldn't be done or that it's not
worth doing.
Quite the contrary, I believe it is absolutely worth doing. With more
users comes
more developers, which few open source projects would complain about.

Thanks,
