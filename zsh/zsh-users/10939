Yes, that's why/because it's a session configuration file.
There, you put the definition of the environment variables and
tty settings... that will affect your login session.

Environment variables and tty settings are inherited by all the
processes started during the session (whose common ancestors are
your login shell).

It would make more sense not to introduce duplicates in the
