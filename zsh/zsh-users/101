I often want to insert the Nth word from the previous command, 
similar to the insert-last-word command. How can I do this?

I would also like to bind a several commands to a key. Bindkey seems to
accept only one command per key. Is there a way to get around this?  (If
this can be done, my first problem will be solved too.)
