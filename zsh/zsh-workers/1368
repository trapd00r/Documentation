I have very similar symptoms on IRIX 5.2 with ZSH_VERSION
2.6-beta13. The problem is not easily reproduceable at all, it occurs
after zsh has been running for a while. When I resize back to a width of
80 characters line editing is ok again. Now widen again and it breaks
now immediately again.
Very annoying.
