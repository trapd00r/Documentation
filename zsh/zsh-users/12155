Subject: copying a million small files between disks?
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Content-Disposition: inline

I'm not exaggerating. I have over one million small files that like to
move between disks. The problem is that even getting a directory
listing takes forever.

Is there a best practice for this?

I don't really need the directory listing, I just need to move all the
files. I have been using rsync, but that takes a very long time to
generate the list of files to be moved.

Any alternatives?

Thanks in advance.
