It would be very nice if the mailing lists appeared to be hosted at zsh.org
even if the real list exploder is elsewhere.  That way we wouldn't have to
change the mailing list addresses when the exploder moves, and would avoid
problems like this one:

} The message went through both gatech and sunsite.auc so picked up two sets
} of numbers.  Neither is more useful than the other.  gatech is now missing
} messages that get sent straight to sunsite.auc.  sunsite.auc has announce
} and users messages mixed in.

The sunsite.auc numbers ARE more useful and should be considered the "real"
ones.  It's no big deal if there are a few users and announce messages in
the sequence, but it's really bad if some messages are missing from the
sequence.  Only sunsite.auc has them all.
