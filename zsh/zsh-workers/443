Here is the latest version from beta9-hzoli11.  The cross ref. to Etc/MACHINES
is missing from test9.  It should mention, that yp_all is broken on some SunOS
4.1.3 systems (e.g. the one in libc.so.1.9.1 is broken).

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Completion has a habit of doing the wrong thing after a
backslash/newline.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you suspend "man", zle seems to get into cooked mode.  It works ok
for plain "less".
It is not specific neither to man nor to zsh.
E.g. call the fallowing program foo:
#include <sys/wait.h>
#include <unistd.h>

void main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    int status;

    if (!fork())	/* child */
	execvp(argv[1], argv + 1);
    else		/* parent */
	wait(&status);
}
Then if you suspend
% foo less something
from zsh/bash, zle/readline gets into cooked mode.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
% test=test
% echo "${test##`echo '*'`}"
test
sh gives empty string here. Is it a bug or a feature?
------------------------------------------------------------------------
% zsh -c 'cat a_long_file | less ; :'
can be interrupted with ^C. The prompt comes back and less is orphaed.
If you go to the end of the file with less and cat terminates, ^C
will not terminate less. The `; :' after less forces zsh to fork before
executing less.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
On Suns in xterm if a line wraps to the next line and the cursor is in
the last column on the sreen and you type a character the charactr after
the cursor is replaced on the screen with the character the cursor is on.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
An other problem which may be related to the previous one. In Sun xterms
the output of the following is overwritten by the next prompt if
no_prompt_cr is not set, and if it is set the first character of the
prompt appears in the last column overwriting the `9' character there:
% echo 01234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789 | more
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The pattern %?* maches names beginning with %? instead of names with at
least two characters beginning with %. This is a hack to allow %?foo job
substitution without quoting. This behaviour is incompatible with sh
and ksh and may be removed in the future. A good fix would be to keep
such patterns unchanged if they do not match regardless of the state of
the nonomatch and nullglob options.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
On some systems nawk is broken and produces incorrect signames.h file.
This make the signals code unusable. This often happens on Ultrix, HP-UX,
IRIX (?). Install gawk if you experience such problems.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
On some systems (e.g. on Solaris or on AIX)
% zsh -c ':' &
gives
[1]  + suspended (tty output)  zsh -c ':'
This means that zsh scripts cannot be started in the background.  They
can still be backgrounded if started without &, stopped by ^Z and
backgrounded by bg.  The tty output signal is probably comes from the
initialisation of the TERM variable.
% zsh -c ':' < /dev/null >& /dev/null &
works fine.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Username completion may cause SEGV on SunOS 4.1.3 and NIS.
This is not a zsh bug.  See Etc/MACHINES for details.
