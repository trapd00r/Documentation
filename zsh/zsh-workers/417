I have tried the same but on my system it's
working fine. Possibly is the difference the
system we're working on?
My version is 2.6-beta9 on a French-German
SCO OpenServer 5.0


frosch@doc2> lpr hh@hh
Anforderungskennung ist eng_lw3-17 (1 Datei)

("@" is the special character (german umlaut).
reporter output on request, it's just to long.)
