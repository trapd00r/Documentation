Subject: Using _values with ->state transitions?
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

This is supposed to work, isn't it?  There appears to be code for it in
_values, but there aren't any examples of it in the existing completion
system. I can't get it to do anything sensible in several attempts.

The zsh/computil documentation needs some improvement.
