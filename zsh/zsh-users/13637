The following should work:

...
TABS=( ${=$(sqlite3 $DB .tables)} )
for TAB in $TABS ; do
...

${=...} turns on SH_WORD_SPLIT. And, I think the parentheses around $TABS 
was the cause of the odd error message.

Note that this'll fail if tables contain spaces in their names. (Which is 
kind of pathological, but possible in SQLite.) I tried adding the '-line' 
option to sqlite3, but the output was unchanged.

Best,
Ben
