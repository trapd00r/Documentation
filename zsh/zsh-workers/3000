This requires my ztrftime() patch in 2963, which is why I wrote it like
that; otherwise, the length of the time string isn't fixed.  It's also
system specific whether %e or %d (with leading zero) is used (or, to put
it another way, AIX likes to be different).

We actually have

#define st_atime        st_atim.tv_sec
#define st_mtime        st_mtim.tv_sec
#define st_ctime        st_ctim.tv_sec

which I didn't look at closely enough.
