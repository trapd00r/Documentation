Yes, it looks like the collation sequence for accented characters is
different in your library.  It's a nuisance since that leaves no way of
testing this---it's already forced into en_US.UTF-8 which gives the
expected answer on other systems.

We might be able to compare the output of "sort", I suppose, but that does
rely on sort being internationalized.  It's probably a reasonable bet if
we've got this far.
