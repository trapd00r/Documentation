} The question is if someone know a way to recover them.
} Maybe something like in reverse of clone.

You're almost certainly not going to be able to get back to them in
a state where you can reliably continue doing whatever work you were
involved in before the crash.  Anything that's running a full-screen
application such as a text editor is probably beyond hope.

The simplest thing is probably to just send them all HUP signals and
let them exit on their own.

However, you can try an application called "retty".

This may get you connected again in a good enough state to be able to
at least exit cleanly from each of the shells.  Or it may fail to work
at all.
