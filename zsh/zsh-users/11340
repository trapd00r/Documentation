got it!

it was partly that my script outputs the percentage of battery charge, 
complete with a trailing "%". of course this needed to be escaped, but i 
think the missing "setopt promptsubst" was the bigger problem. i'd feel 
stupid about it, but there doesn't seem to be any reference to that in the 
zshall man page (zsh-4.3.2).

if anyone wants a copy of the script that seems to work with freebsd's 
acpi, drop me a line. the only problem with it is that the sysctl command 
takes about 0.2-0.3 seconds, so i'll probably run it as a cron job, 
writing to a file, and having the prompt read it from the file.
