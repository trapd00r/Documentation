Hi all ;),

I've been searching in the list archives and in zsh documentation, for
the subject question, with little success. From what i understand, there
is some kind of partial utf-8 support in zsh... My doubts are: Are there
plans to add full utf-8 support to zsh/zle? Is currently somebody
working on it?

Thanks,
