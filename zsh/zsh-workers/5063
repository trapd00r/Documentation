No - now that I give it a second thought, you are right.

Geoff> Ah, now where do I get this intelligent archive software :-)

It was just a thought :-)

Anyway - what other solutions can we come up with? Is there anybody or
anything besides the mail archive that uses the sequence numbers to
anything?  If there is not, I would assume, that the archive could
invent it's own numbering scheme which is unrelated to the X-Seq
numbers, subscribe to all 3 lists and then make some filtering taking
Message-ID into account (to find postings which have been posted to
several of the lists). I do not consider it a great loose, that the
two archives is not synchronized - I do not think, that anyone uses
both of them. (or am I wrong?)
