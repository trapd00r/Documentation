Hmmm, lesee...

% netscape http://www.altavista.com/

(In the text field, enter  YODL  and press return)

Select the first item on the list that appears  "YODL V1.11"
	<URL:http://www.icce.rug.nl/docs/programs/yodl/yodl.html>

On the page that appears, select "4.1 Obtaining and installing YODL".

(Feel free to use these directions to find just about any program whose 
name is not a common word.)
