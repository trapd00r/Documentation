A while loop is the obvious way.  You can read in the entire file
(file="$(<file)") and substitute on that.  My example succeeded with this:

print -r ${(S)file//$'\n#<='*$'\n#=>'}

although the following is better since it takes account of the fact
that a comment may be at the start: 

print -r ${(S)file//($'\n'|(#s))\#\<\=*$'\n#=>'}

This requires extended_glob.

You're missing the fact that your substitution is of the form ${line#...}.
This is explicitly documented to remove the shortest matching chunk at
the head of the line.  Try adding another "#":

    print ${line##\#(<=|=>| |)}
