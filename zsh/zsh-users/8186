I don't think this is a bug. That the older xterm has the desired
behaviour is probably just that it has a different default value for the
resource "eightBitInput". Just put

XTerm.VT100.eightBitInput: false

into your ~/.Xresources file (assuming that Debian is set up to use this)
and you'll get the ESC-behaviour rather than the (R).
If you want to know more, do

man xterm

Never file bug reports without having read the manpage.
