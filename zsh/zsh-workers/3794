Was wondering if any of you have encountered the problem I'm having.. 


I'm running zsh on a Solaris 2.5.. 
and have zsh set up as my shell under NIS.. 

The only way I can recall commands in my history is by first hitting the
"down" arrow key and only then the "up" arrow key..

If I hit the "up" arrow key first.. it just beeps and does nothing.. 

Can't seem to figure this one out..

It works just dandy on my linux setup at home..
