Subject: Minor expansion problem
Date: Tue, 25 Sep 2001 14:09:37 +0100
Message-ID: <27130.1001423377@csr.com>
From: Peter Stephenson <pws@csr.com>

Can anyone would explain why I get

% echo foo and, just to be different, bar >foo
% echo `cat foo`<TAB>
     ->foo\ and,\ just\ to\ be\ different,\ bar.

with the _expand completer (and complete-word bound to TAB), but what I
expect, i.e. no backslashes, with the _expand_word widget?  I've stared at
my styles but can't see what might be causing it.
