The normal syntax for while is:

while list1-of-comands
do list1-of-commands
done

So you have to have a way to tell while where the first list of
commands end.

You can use the short version only when list1-of-commands is
((...)) or [[...]] and list2-of-commands is bound by {} or ().

while ((1)) {echo this is neat}



while true; echo this is neat

would be parsed as while and the first two commands of
list1-of-commands.

It's true that zsh could probably have been made to allow:

while { list1 } { list2 }

There might be good reasons why it's not supported though.
