} That's not a bad idea. They'd be out of the way in the Compctl directory
} so I don't think it would be too much of an encouragement.

Unfortunately, thinking about it a bit more, most of compctl-examples is
not functions but compctl commands.  Unlike the new completion system,
there's no convenient way to autoload them, so putting them under the
Functions directory doesn't make as much sense.

Unless ...

I just had a wonderful, awful idea ... one could use `compctl -T' to call
a function, which runs an autoloaded function, which defines a compctl,
which is then called because the -T attempt didn't generate a match ...

Oh, dear.
