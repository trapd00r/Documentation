Subject: N, e, + missing from sort qualifiers in _globquals
From: Mikael Magnusson <mikachu@gmail.com>
To: zsh workers <zsh-workers@zsh.org>
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

I couldn't figure out (in the 2 minutes I managed to stay interested)
how to make the e and + cases behave like they do without the o. I'm
not sure how informative the help is for oe and o+, i just copied them
from o and +.
url to patch since i still hate email and it usually messes up
