Subject: History and $!
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

This is not a very significant bug, but ... the history mechanism ignores $!
some of the time:

zsh% sleep 60 &
zsh% echo $!
1507

But various other forms don't work:

zsh% echo ${!}
echo ${echo $!}
zsh: bad substitution
zsh% echo "$!"
dquote> 


This problem has been around for a very long time.  Of course, one can do

zsh% echo ${\!}
1507

Or even

zsh% echo $\!
1507

But that's a bit odd, because it doesn't work for any other variable name,
and it doesn't work when history is not active.
