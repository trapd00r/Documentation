Yes, this is a very good place for that.

Good catch -- that code is new for 4.3.x: it's a slightly optimized
version of some setline() code, but the check to see if zlecs was non-
zero was accidentally dropped from the algorithm.  I've checked in a
fix.  Note that your suggested fix will work just fine, but I ended up
using a slightly different check (taken from setline()) where it just
checks zlecs against 0 instead of calling findbol().

Thanks for the report,
