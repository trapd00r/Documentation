[This message probably contains no content of interest to anyone

bugs.debian.org accepts mail from nearly everyone, on the principle that
people shouldn't have to jump through hoops to report problems.  Or
something similar.

Assuming ejb is still not on the mailing lists (he wasn't last round),
he, as a submitter, would not get your reply unless he were Cc'd, the
object of an X-Debbugs-Cc header, or the message were sent to
nnnnnn-submitter@bugs.debian.org, where nnnnnn is the bug number.

Since your message did go though to the bug log as well as the
zsh-workers list, he can now read it by going to
http://bugs.debian.org/243385 , requesting a copy via the email
interface, or checking the zsh-workers ML archives.

The Debian repackaging contains the same version as in CVS HEAD.

If anyone is interested, the Debian tree has been in Arch
for a while now.  You can check out a copy by doing the following
(assuming you use tla)

% tla register-archive zsh@packages.debian.org--pkg-zsh \
	http://arch.debian.org/arch/pkg-zsh/current

% tla get zsh@packages.debian.org--pkg-zsh/zsh--debian



At present, the only differences from 4.2.0 are


2004-03-25  Clint Adams  <clint@zsh.org>

	* 19691: Completion/Unix/Type/_diff_options: Allow more than
	one --exclude or -x to diff.

2004-03-23  Peter Stephenson  <pws@csr.com>

	* 19661: Danek Duvall: Completion/Unix/Type/_diff_options:
	support diff -u on Solaris from 2.10 up.

2004-03-22  Clint Adams  <clint@zsh.org>

	* 19673: Peter Palfrader: Completion/Unix/Command/_cvs:
	tags can contain the + character.

2004-03-20  Bart Schaefer  <schaefer@zsh.org>

	* 19666 (tweaked): Completion/Unix/Command/_ssh: fixes for remote
	file completion for scp, suggested by Jay Berkenbilt <ejb@ql.org>.

	* users/7172: Functions/Prompts/prompt_bart_setup: include "unset"
	among the localoptions, as this relies on it.
