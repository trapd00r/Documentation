Subject: pws-20 bug >> completion makes partial line vanish


OK I didn't know how to make a good Subject: line for this, but here's the  
scenario which I think it new to pws-20:


I'm in the "Src" directory after a successful 'make' of pws-20


# mv zs[tab]

gives me

# mv zsh
zsh*                    zsh.export              zsh.mdhi                zshxmods.h 
zsh-3.1.5-pws-20*       zsh.h                   zsh.mdhs
zsh-3.1.5-pws-20-NI*    zsh.mdd                 zsh.test*
zsh-3.1.5-pws-20-m68k*  zsh.mdh                 zshpaths.h

# mv zsh[tab] gives me
# mv zsh-3.1.5-pws-20
zsh*                    zsh.export              zsh.mdhi                zshxmods.h 
zsh-3.1.5-pws-20*       zsh.h                   zsh.mdhs
zsh-3.1.5-pws-20-NI*    zsh.mdd                 zsh.test*
zsh-3.1.5-pws-20-m68k*  zsh.mdh                 zshpaths.h

(now I use my UP ARROW to get a history replacement and get this as a result)

#mv zsh             -NI /usr/bin

(notice the big empty space?)

with the cursor over the '-' of '-NI'

control a & control e (beginning of line/end of line) and I get the proper

#mv zsh-3.1.5-pws-20-NI /usr/bin


Anyone know what this is all about?
