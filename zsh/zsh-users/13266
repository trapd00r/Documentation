Ah, yes, I remember the change.  However, now you've reminded me, I
think what's changed is the ability to add the (@) to get the normal
splitting-in-double-quotes behaviour.  The fact that splitting overrides
the effect of the quotes is longstanding (and in my view wrong, although
it's too late to change it).
