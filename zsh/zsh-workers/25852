Hmm.  Looking at _complete_debug output, "abc{d" has already become
"abcdef" before the first completer is even called.  In fact, it has
become that before _setup is even called.  Here we are, barely into
_main_complete:

: _main_complete:49:if; [[ automenu-unambiguous == tab* ]]
: _main_complete:59:if; [[ -z '' ]]
: _main_complete:60:then if; [[ -o equals ]]
: _main_complete:60:then if cmdand; compset -P 1 '='
: _main_complete:62:then elif; [[ abcdef != */* && a == \~ ]]
: _main_complete:70; _setup default

That's $PREFIX on line 62 and the curly brace is already missing.
