I think 7436 is the correct fix to the problem.

Base/_complete_opts should be removed. Because there are no completion
function which use it (except old _cvs) and it has very poor
name/implementation/document.

The separation is sometimes useful for custumizations because we can
override each function individually. These functions behaves like `hook'.
I think it is useful that making hooks more easily without adding new files.
