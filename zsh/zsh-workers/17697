In particular, look in mklibgcc (generated from mklibgcc.in in the source
directory).

This is using MULTILIBS passed down from the Makefile, so check that
that looks correct.

Just before half way down, this goes into
  for ml in $MULTILIBS; do
so check each individual ml is correct.

The $ml then goes into
    flags=`echo ${ml} | sed -e 's/^[^;]*;//' -e 's/@/ -/g'`
which is used in
    $gcc_compile $flags -E -xassembler-with-cpp -
which is the bit that looks wrong.
