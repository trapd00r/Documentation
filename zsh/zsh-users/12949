Hi I solved this by
chmod 755-ing all the directories reported by compinit

$ chmod 755 /usr/bin/zsh /usr/share/zsh/site-functions 
/usr/share/zsh/4.3.4/functions /usr/local /usr/share/zsh 
/usr/share/zsh/4.3.4

they had been 777 (why? don't know)

Whoops red face
I hadn't been using compinit on old PC but rather compctl, so that's why 
the new .zshenv "uncovered" the problem. Sorry about this but may be this 
posting someone else who has this problem.
