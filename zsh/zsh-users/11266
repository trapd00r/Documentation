Why don't you try: bindkey | egrep redisplay\|clear-screen
and see what it spits out.

I can think of a few possible explanations for what you're seeing... one 
would be that the termcap/terminfo entries for your terminal is wrong.

I would like to see:

- the output of:
env | egrep '^(TERM|VISUAL|EDITOR|PS1)$' | sed 's/[[:cntrl]]/?/g'

- the output of infocmp, if you have it.

- ESPECIALLY: do you have a program called "script"? If so, run it, 
reproduce the completion problem in the shell it spawns, and then exit 
that shell. It will produce a file named "typescript"; either make that 
available somewhere and link to it in your reply, or else send it to me 
directly (I'm not sure the list will appreciate such a file being sent 
out), and I'll post a link to it for anyone else who's interested.
