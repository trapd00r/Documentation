This is caused by 8424. (like zle.mdd)

Yes. I forgot to apply these forgotten patches to bart-7.

I gave up to track promptinit because the series of patches for
promptinit causes too many rejection...

META-FAQ is ignored by .cvsignore.

Hm.  It's interesting. I confirmed that "cvs co zsh" doesn't produce
_xrdb.  But "cvs co -r HEAD zsh" and "cvs export -r HEAD zsh" produce
_xrdb.

Maybe, "cvs admin -b1.1.1" is not enough to revive a file after
"cvs remove".
