    [advocacy] Actually, the only reason I don't know how to use find is
because of zsh.  Since it's my shell wherever I'm at, I tend to type stuff
like that in all the time :).  Once you've learnt the basic globbing stuff
(?, *, [], {}), the extended glob options are brilliant.. *(@) and a few
others in particular are so useful!  If you don't know them yet, I'd highly
advise learning them.
