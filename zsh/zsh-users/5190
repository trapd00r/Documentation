Hi guys,

zsh seems to lose \s when run as sh, e.g. the last command here:

~% zsh --version
zsh 4.0.4 (i686-pc-linux-gnu)
~% zsh
~% printf "%s\n" '\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
~% printf "%s\n" `printf "%s\n" '\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'`
\\\\\\\\
~% 
~% cd /tmp
/tmp% zsh --version
zsh 4.0.4 (i686-pc-linux-gnu)
/tmp% zsh
/tmp% printf "%s\n" '\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
/tmp% printf "%s\n" `printf "%s\n" '\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'`
\\\\\\\\
/tmp% exit
/tmp% ln -s `which zsh` sh
/tmp% ./sh
%~%% printf "%s\n" '\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
%~%% printf "%s\n" `printf "%s\n" '\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'`
\\\\
%~%% 

bash, pdksh and ash print "\\\\\\\\" (when running as sh at least).


Thanks
Ian
