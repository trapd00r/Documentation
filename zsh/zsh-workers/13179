Every now and then I thought about it and always failed to find reliable
solution.

It is worse than just quoting. You have to deal with pipelines and complex
commands. Consider:

bor@itsrm2% preexec() { print $1 > /tmp/foo }
bor@itsrm2% while false
while> do
while> print x
while> done
bor@itsrm2% cat /tmp/foo
while false
do
print x
done

That was the main reason I never came up with any solution.
