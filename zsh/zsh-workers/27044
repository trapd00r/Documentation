True, although if it seems useful it can be mentioned in the
documentation for the replacement run-help.  Based on recent experience,
I haven't been finding it *that* useful.  With a widget like this,
run-help could be made cleverer in this respect by offering to give help
for words following coproc, noglob, etc.
