Hello,

I was browsing through all the zsh documentation and ML archives. And I 
thought is there no zsh book available? 'O Reilly doesn't have one, and
even with google I can not find anything.

I only saw one reference in the ML archives about someone asking input
for a zsh book.

Does anybody know if there is something in the works (somewhere).

grtz
      Miek

PS yes I could print it all out, or read it from my screen, but I kinda
   like books :-)
