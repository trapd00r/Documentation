Subject: PATCH: result of warnings from Cygwin

I wasn't going to post this, but it occurs to me people may have
comments about better ways to do some of these to avoid warnings.
One of them is actually a bug---it's wrong to test a wchar_t (rather
than a wint_t) against WEOF even if it happens to work on some systems.

zsh now compiles by default with MULTIBYTE_SUPPORT on Cygwin, but
I haven't the first clue how to get a command line window with a
sensible character set (i.e. UTF-8).
