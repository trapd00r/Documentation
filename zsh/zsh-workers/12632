Yes, I knew it; that why I used ac_cv_cygwin and not CYGWIN.

Are you sure, it is a problem of missing empty line? Look, what is generated:

CYGWIN=
test "$ac_cv_cygwin" = yes && CYGWIN=yes                   echo $ac_n
"checking for mingw32 environment""... $ac_c" 1>&6

that is, CYGWIN is set in environment of `echo' command and lost after this.
This expansion is part of AC_CYGWIN and has nothing to do with AC_EXEEXT.
There is no way to change it. I even believe to have seen a bug report once,
but currently querying autoconf bug database yields no result.
