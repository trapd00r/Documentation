Additional note: I think, until all issues are resolved, the configure
parameter (--enable-lfs would do) is needed. Currently I simply cannot
disable LFS even if I don't need it at all (I don't want to set CPPFLAGS to
some silly value; and in my case they are CFLAGS and not CPPFLAGS in the
first place).
