I've decided i would try to look at the completion system of zsh. 
I want to complete on sessions opened by screen(1):

i get when running:
$ screen -x
> There are several suitable screens on:
>        899.pts-10.linux3       (Attached)
>        326.pts-54.linux3       (Attached)
> Type "screen [-d] -r [pid.]tty.host" to resume one of them.


Could anybody tell me where to start (i want to learn it by example, manual
-reading will follow), or has it already been implemented?
