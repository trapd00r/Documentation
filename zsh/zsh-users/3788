} The named directory ~out was defined, but it has disappeared:
} 
} greux:~> echo ~out
} zsh: no such user or named directory: out

    bug () {
        hash -d out=$HOME
        echo ~out
        local out
        out=(oops) 
        ( echo ~out )
	: Without the subshell above, this line is never reached
    }

The local variable "out" is used by _pids, so that named directory will be
stomped whenever you complete process IDs.

On the other hand, if you actually set the global variable "out":

    unbug () {
	out=$HOME
	bug
	echo ~out
    }

The named directory still gets stomped, but is automatically restored any
time you refer to it.
