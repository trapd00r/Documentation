Subject: Hosts completion
Date: Fri, 18 Jun 1999 19:05:48 +0100
X-Mailer: Internet Mail Service (5.5.2448.0)

Following is a replacement for the hosts completion. I've added an initial
line which attempts to set $hosts if it isn't already and I've added
matching control: host names are not case-sensitive so should be treated as
such and it's useful if '.' is treated as special like '/' in path names.
I've also added telnet and xhost to the list of commands to work on.
Host names isn't the perfect completion for them but they haven't got a
better completion yet.
