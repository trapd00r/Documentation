Well, I did it again the followin way:
1) gtar xvzf zah-3.0.1.tar.gz
2) cd zsh-3.0.1
3) patch -N < ../diffs-test2
4) ./configure --enable-etcdir=/usr/local/etc
-- may be pathch -N is wrong ?
5) cd ..
6) diff -r -b -c zsh-*-test[12] | less

(I now did it in LINUX too, with the same result)

The diff shows, that the whole check for 'working named fifos' is
'eliminated' by the diffs.

*-test1/config.h contains.
/* Define to 1 if system has working FIFO's */
#define HAVE_FIFOS 1

*-test2/config.h contains.
/* Define to 1 if system has working FIFO's */
/* #undef HAVE_FIFOS */

(I tried reinserting the lines which were shown with '- ..'
in the diff, and then I get the 'old' result as in *-test1.)

May be the Version in *-test2 is correct ?
And HAVE_FIFOS is set somewhere else ?


Clueless... Stucki
