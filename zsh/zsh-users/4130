Hi, and excuse me if these are already answered but
a quick look at TFM didn't help. Anyway,

How I can make zsh3 add slash when doing:
cd ..[TAB]? bash does this automatically and IMHO
it's really useful.

Is there a way to use own function in ~/.zshrc for man
completion instead of zsh4 builtin? Setting fpath=~/
or ~/.zshrc doesn't help.

Thanks in advance!
