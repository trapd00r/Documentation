Seen in zrecompile:

        if { [[ ! -f $zwc ]] || mv $zwc ${zwc}.old } &&
             zcompile $map $tmp $zwc $files 2> /dev/null; then
          [[ -z $quiet ]] && print succeeded
        else
          [[ -z $quiet ]] && print failed
          ret=1
        fi

Why does zrecompile redirect STDERR to /dev/null when running
zcompile?  It means that if you're doing something like

  zrecompile ... -M -U ~/.zsh/functions.zwc ~/.zsh/functions/*(*)

then if something in ~/.zsh/functions has a syntax error, you just get 

  re-compiling /nfs-home/adams/.zsh/functions.zwc: failed

with no indication of which file was the culprit.
