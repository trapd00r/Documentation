In ksh93, $arrayname is a synonym for ${arrayname[0]}.  This appears to be
true for indexed arrays _and_ associative arrays.

If you think of nameref as being like a symbolic link and ${!foo} as being
like lstat(), it makes perfect sense (at least to my twisted mind) that
${!foo} is just "foo" for ordinary (non nameref) variables.
