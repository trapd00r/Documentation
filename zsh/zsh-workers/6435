Personally, I'm not too worried about things which give `bad substitution'
in other shells --- note that the presence of quotes never gave you that
message in zsh before, it simply didn't do anything.  We've already got a
whole heap of cases which zsh accepts but other shells don't.  If we embark
on a syntax-tightening exercise, I rather suspect we'll never get to the
end.
