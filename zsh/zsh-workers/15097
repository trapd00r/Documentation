There is none because zsh is not localized in any way :-) Seriously, bugs
related to i18n were

- multibyte support. This requires total rewrite of string-handling code and
some volunteers I guess

- usual problem with ranges like [a-z] in locale that sorts
case-insensitive. Ironically, it is the only place where locale is supported
in zsh :-))

Well, keep us informed.

Note that l10n is different issue. Now with completion system evolving into
mini user interface, having message catalogs is not a bad idea.
