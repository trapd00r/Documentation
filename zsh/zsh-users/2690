It's not defunct; your message reached it.  There just happens to be one
bad address on the list that causes a bounce message to be returned when
the list server forwards to that person.

} /export/home/tdillard/.zshrc[16]: syntax error: `(' unexpected

That is not an error message from zsh.  There is no circumstance in which
zsh prints "syntax error" and "unexpected" -- zsh prints "parse error".

So what appears to be happening is that the interactive tool is running
/bin/sh or ksh, and something -- perhaps your .profile file, or the ENV
environment variable?  Is causing that other shell to read your .zshrc.
