} My short answer is that I don't think there's any good solution.  The
} tag-order style is going to be confusing no matter what we do [...]

One additional thought:  It would be nice to be able to specify that
_paths_ are completed, rather than merely directories; i.e. like the
difference between "compctl -g '*(-/)'" and "compctl -/".  I'm not
convinced that "zstyle *directories file-patterns '*(-/)'" does that.

} some kind of blaring all-caps text in the tag-order documentation:
} 
} NAMING A TAG IN TAG-ORDER DOES NOT CAUSE COMPLETIONS FOR THAT TAG TO BE
} GENERATED; RATHER, IT SORTS THE COMPLETIONS AFTER THEY ARE GENERATED.

Hrm, maybe even add "... BUT ONLY _IF_ ANY ARE GENERATED FOR THAT TAG."
