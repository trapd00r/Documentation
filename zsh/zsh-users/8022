Okay, I've tried it for a while and I'm not happy with it. I have the same
problems with it as with the bash programmable completion project. Little
annoyances everywhere such as "svn import k<TAB>" refusing to complete on
files in the current directory and there's also the complexity. I feel
uneasy about using the completion code as root, because it touches lots of
files behind my back.

So I'm going to live with basic builtin completion. Any chances of getting
the above completion to work with it? If not, I'd be grateful for pointers
into the zsh code so that I can see if I can fix it myself.=20
