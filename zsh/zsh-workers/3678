You can have the list server send them to you by sending a message like:

--- Begin example message ---
To: zsh-workers-request@math.gatech.edu
Subject: archive

help
get latest/1234
get latest/2345 latest/?
egrep archive latest/*
--- End example message ---

This would return (in separate messages) the archive instructions;
messages 1234, 2345, and 1-9; and the output of grepping for "archive"
in all the messages.

Just remember to send it to the -request address, not the list.
