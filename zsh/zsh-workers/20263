I've now committed the integer truncation patch for a field trial.
We still need to identify internal variables which could usefully be
promoted to zlong to avoid another involuntary truncation.

I've also updated the shell version to 4.2.1-dev-1 so that the
development version doesn't clash with the released version.

As I briefly mentioned, I'm on holiday for two weeks from tomorrow.
