Hi... I'm trying to get zsh 3.0.0 to compile on Solaris x86, and I'm not 
having any luck.  I followed the instructions in the Etc/MACHINES file 
for Solaris 2.X (unset $LD_LIBRARY_PATH) and that didn't help.

I don't know what sort of information you would need in order to give me 
suggestions - please email me if you want any copies of the output of 
make, or configure, or anything else.

Thanks a lot!
Scott
