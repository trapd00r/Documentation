Hi Bart ;);

Yes, it looks the same, whether the Control key is pressed or not, so
it seems my terminal emulator is sending the same sequence in both
cases.

You explained enough and have been very helpful, thanks ;). I've just seen
another response from Raúl that explains a solution to modify my keymap
to generate a different sequence to ctrl+repag, so i'll try that.

It's a better solution, that's true. But i think that a keybinding like
'\e{' is also a good solution, and i my case i don't have custom keybindings
with the escape sequence, so it's a rather safe solution.

Thanks again ;)
