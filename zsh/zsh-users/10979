_ssh doesn't recognize the -F option at the moment; this fixes that.
Then an alias certainly ought to do the trick.

alias foo='ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.foo -F ~/.ssh/config.foo'

I could add a style to pick the config file, but even that's not really
quite what's needed here, and isn't of much general use since ssh either
uses a fixed file or what's on the command line.
