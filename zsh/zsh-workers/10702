} I would be in favour of that. The possible confusion when
} forgetting to check/quote the `#' and `%' at the beginning of
} parameters used there is more important than the advantage, I think.

The change went in in 6002.  It was followed in 6003 by a change to allow
a leading double backslash to escape the delimiter.  So all you need to
do is change uses of ${foo/$bar/...} into ${foo/\\$bar/...} to avoid the
confusion.  And without 6002, there's no way to build up an anchored
pattern in a variable (which was Andrej's original complaint).

Also, though I'm the last person to argue for keeping a change solely for
compatibility, bash recognizes the same syntaxes.
