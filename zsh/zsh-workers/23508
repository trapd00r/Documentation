Hello !

I just found a bug in ZSH with double left redirection.
First I generate a file like this :
> echo "cat << EOF" > segfault_file
> for i in `seq 10000`; do echo `printf "%010000d" 0` >> segfault_file; done

Then I try to make it execute to ZSH like this :
> zsh < segfault_file

After a little while ZSH segfaults !
This was successfully reproduced over Linux and NetBSD.

I hope you'll find it useful.
