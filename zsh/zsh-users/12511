I don't think spaces except the 0x20 one are as big a problem since
they don't cause trouble with word splitting. And it looks like your
script is about editing files, not renaming them?

(you can simplify your script by giving two -e switches to one sed
call, or one regex with a | in it. if you're using gnu sed you can
further simplify it with the -i switch.)
