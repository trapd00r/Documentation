Hi,

`copy-earlier-word' works well (cycles through words on the same history line) with
`insert-last-word', but it fails with `smart-insert-last-word'.  The code appears to check for `[[
$LASTWIDGET = *insert-last-word ]]'.  Does someone know what's wrong here?  I'm using a week old
cvs version on Linux.
