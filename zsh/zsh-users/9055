Then you want the default behaviour back? :)
I think you should try something like
zstyle ':completion:*' completer _complete _ignored _match _correct _approx=
imate _prefix
(or change your own definition of completer)

I usually do
   ls *.png<ctrl-e>
and my .zshrc contains
   bindkey "^E" expand-word

Of course, I use vi keybindings, so ctrl-e is not used otherwise ;-)

Of course, you could do something like
   > pwd
   /home/me/projekte/current/src/testlib/src
   > cd current backup
   > cd -
   > cp <whatever> $OLDPWD
or
   > pwd
   /home/me/projekte/current/src/testlib/src
   > cp <whatever> ${PWD:s/current/backup}

Just to avoid the need for the whole path.
On the other hand, you could as well
   zstyle ':completion:*' special-dirs true
which does what you want in the first place ;)
