Hi,

I just downloaded 4.0.2 off sourceforge and compiled it. No changes to
configure were made barring changing the prefix to /usr. As suggested I
ran the tests and had C02 fail with a bad status:

[root@excalibur zsh-4.0.2]# make TESTNUM=C02 check
cd Test ; make check
make[1]: Entering directory `/root/zsh-4.0.2/Test'
if test -n "gcc"; then \
  cd .. && \
  make MODDIR=`pwd`/Test/Modules install.modules > /dev/null; \
fi
mkdir /root/zsh-4.0.2/Test/Modules
mkdir /root/zsh-4.0.2/Test/Modules/zsh
for f in ./C02*.ztst; do \
  ../Src/zsh +Z -f ./ztst.zsh $f; \
done
./C02cond.ztst: starting.
Test ./C02cond.ztst failed: bad status 1, expected 0 from:
  [[ -r zerolength && ! -r unmodish ]]
Was testing: -r cond
./C02cond.ztst: test failed.
make[1]: [check] Error 1 (ignored)
rm -rf Modules .zcompdump
make[1]: Leaving directory `/root/zsh-4.0.2/Test'


Are they are all expected to pass? Is this serious enough to stop trying
to install zsh?

Cheers,

Nick
