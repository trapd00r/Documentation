Subject: Don't understand compadd -p (or -P) any more
Date: Mon, 01 Mar 1999 17:13:23 +0100
From: Peter Stephenson <pws@ibmth.df.unipi.it>

I thought I'd got this worked out, so maybe it's a bug.

% _foo() { compadd -p pref/ bar rod; }
% compdef _foo foo
% foo pref/<TAB>                      # nothing
% foo <TAB>
bar rod

and the choices on the line do have the correct prefix.  In other words, if
there's a pre-existing prefix there, it doesn't recognise it.  Now it seems
-P is doing the same thing.  Has the behaviour changed in some way I don't
understand?
