} You're correct.  The code Sven referenced at line 474 needs to be repeated
} after line 484.

Sven's apparently also sent a patch for this which hasn't propagated
through the mailing list yet -- he committed the change.

There's a bug in my patch (++used should be used++) so I'll leave Sven's
instead.
