No, it's not overkill, it's the vital part of the puzzle that makes
using /etc/skel work.  In the past when I (and others) have suggested
using /etc/skel, the packagers have said "what about existing users?"
and then they put the commands into a global init file so that it
affects everyone, old and new users alike.  Having all packages that
install /etc/skel files give the files to existing users (safely)
would take away this objection.
