Generally speaking, I'm not that suprised, since there are large numbers
of odds and ends still to clear up (I haven't tried turning it on yet).

That should have been wint_t.  That's guaranteed to hold either a
wchar_t or a WEOF.

Clint and I have added various type and functions like this without there
being any tests in configure: this is one reason we're currently relying
on the compiler offering support.  If we want to relax that assumption
later, we'll probably have to work out what to do if wchar_t is defined
and wint_t isn't, etc.  I suppose the answer in this case is probably
just stick with wchar_t.  But that's all Zukunftsmusik.
