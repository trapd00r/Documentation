    Hi Bart :))

    I'm a very good cooker, and my wife too ;)) At least, I'm better
at cooking than at zsh completion XDD

    Nice :) I took note for writing my compctl recipes ;)

    Of course, because then any argument is completed as a command,
but that's a very fixed restriction. From the docs I assume that with
-l I can specify which words are commands and which are not. But
really -x is needed for that...

    Since compctl is currently deprecated, would do any harm if I
rewrite this bit of documentation (not in Yodl, please, although I
can try...)? Please take into account that I'm not english-speaking
and the resulting test may be even worse than the current... But
anyway if the patch may be accepted I can do.

    Excuse me for insisting, but really that cannot be done without
-x. I mean, without -x you can only handle special cursor placements
using '-l' with the empty string. That way, word 2 is considered a
command and completed as such. But if you specify a command in the -l
option, then the completion is just an alias (well, more or less),
but doesn't treat specially word 2,3,etc... Please excuse if I sound
clueless: I'm really clueless O:))

    Thanks as always for your invaluable help. I really owe you a
dinner. Or two... No joking ;)
