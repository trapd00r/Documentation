No, bash doesn't set $SHELL to bash, that would be a bug if it
did, it just sets $SHELL to the user's login shell if it's not
already set which is fine. Here, my login shell is zsh,

$ env -i bash -c 'echo $SHELL'
/bin/zsh

$ env SHELL=/bin/rc bash -c 'echo $SHELL'
/bin/rc

So bash acknowledges my choice, it just sets $SHELL in case it
wasn't set before.

Basically, it's doing the job of login(1). login(1) is the
command that generally initialises $SHELL (that is the user's
shell of choice) to the user's login shell (from the "passwd"
database).
