----- Forwarded message from Marc Glisse <glisse@stedding.loria.fr> -----

Assume there is a directory '/data/a a' on host somehost. When I type:
scp somehost:/data/a<TAB>
it gets completed to:
scp somehost:/data/a\\\ a/
But when I press <TAB> again, it fails, as if directory 'a a' did not
exist. I tried manually modifying the line to:
scp somehost:/data/a\\\\\ a/
and then completion works again (another extra pair of '\' still makes it
work), but the command itself does not work anymore.
