<H4>Visual Indicators</H4>
<P>The keyboard has four visual indicators.</P>
<DL>
<DT>Hold screen</DT>
<DD>This indicator lights up when the HOLD SCREEN key is
pressed. To resume text scrolling, press the HOLD SCREEN key again.</DD>
<DT>Lock</DT>
<DD>This indicator is lit when the LOCK key has been pressed. It indicates
that the terminal will generate uppercase characters only.</DD>
<DT>Compose</DT>
<DD>This light is on during a "compose sequence" and is initiated by
pressing the COMPOSE key. The light goes out upon the completion of the compose
sequence.</DD>
<DT>Wait</DT>
<DD>This light is on when the keyboard is locked, preventing transmission
of information because its buffer is full. Once the information in the buffer is
accepted by the host, the WAIT light goes out and transmission resume. Sometimes,
the host "locks" the keyboard.</DD>
</DL>
<H4>Audible Indicators</H4>
<P>The terminal generates a bell tone as part of the power-up self-test. In Set-Up you
can enable or disable the margin bell tone, which sounds when the cursor reaches
the right-hand margin, and/or a warning bell tone to indicate operator errors.</P>
<P>You can also enable or disable the keyclick sound when in Set-Up mode. This
lets you know that the key has been pressed fully. Exceptions to this are pressing
SHIFT or CTRL only, and typing when the keyboard is locked.</P>
<H2>Operator Features</H2>
<P>The VT200 family stores many of its operating characteristics in a nonvolatile memory
that retains these settings even when the power is shut off. These operating
characteristics can be changed by entering the Set-Up mode. Some characteristics,
such as transmit and receive speed, affect communications with the host and
printer. These must be set according to the host's and printer's requirements. Other
characteristics, such as the type of cursor to be displayed, can be set according to
your preference. Through the keyboard or the host, you can change all the available
Set-Up characteristics to tailor the terminal to your preference.</P>
<H3>Set-Up</H3>
<P>Set-Up is based on selectable monitor displays called "screens". Only one screen
can be displayed at a time. Each one presents a logical grouping of choices from
which you can select terminal parameters.</P>
<P>You can even enter Set-Up while you are working in a file without loss of data.
The data is redisplayed when you exit Set-Up. Entering Set-Up is achieved by pressing
the Set-Up key. The Set-Up Directory screen is displayed immediately. This
screen lets you access any other Set-Up screen. It also presents fields you can access
to select terminal operating parameters. To select a field, use the arrow keys to
position the cursor at the field you want to invoke. Then use the ENTER key to
invoke the field.</P>

<DL>
<DT>Screen title</DT>
<DD>Blinks and identifies the current screen.</DD>
<DT>Terminal identifier</DT>
<DD>Identifies if the terminal is VT220 or VT240.</DD>
<DT>Firmware version number</DT>
<DD>Identifies the level of terminal firmware.</DD>
<DT>Action fields</DT>
<DD>These are choices that offer a single value. When you select
and invoke an action field, a single action is performed. For example, each
screen, except the Set-Up Directory screen, has an action field that reads "TO
DIRECTORY." Invoking this field replaces the current screen with the Directory
screen.</DD>
<DT>Parameter fields (not found on all screens)</DT>
<DD>These are blocks of self-describing
text that offer more than one choice. When you select a parameter field, the
field offers you a range of choices. For example, if you select the TRANSMIT
SPEED parameter field, you can then choose from one of the following speeds:
75, 100, 150, 300, 600, 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600, and 19,200 baud. Each parameter
field has a factory default value that is invoked if you do not change it. The
value currently in a field is the value that will be invoked when you exit Set-Up.</DD>
<DT>Text parameter fields (not found on all screens)</DT>
<DD>These are fields that require
you to make a direct text entry through the keyboard. If you select one of these,
the screen prompts you for text input, such as the answerback message.</DD>
<DT>Status line</DT>
<DD>This appears at the bottom of the Set-Up screen. This line is
merely a reporting line that gives you a status report on the modem's state, the
printer, and the terminal insert/replace mode. See the <CITE>VT220</CITE> and <CITE>VT240 Series
Owner's Manual</CITE> for more detail.</DD>
</DL>
<P>During set-up the ENTER key can also do the following:</P>
<UL>
<LI>When the cursor is positioned on an action field, the ENTER key invokes the
described action.</LI>
<LI>If the cursor is on a parameter list, the field value displayed is changed when
you press ENTER. You can use ENTER to toggle through the possible field values.
The value you leave displayed is the value invoked.</LI>
<LI>When you press ENTER and the cursor is on a text parameter field, the terminal
prompts you for text.</LI>
<LI>You can also use the ENTER key to toggle through the sequence of Set-Up
Screens &#8211; General, Display, Keyboard, Communications, Printer, and Tab, plus
Graphics and Telephone for the VT240 Series.</LI>
</UL>
<H4>Set-Up Directory Screen</H4>
<P>This is the first of the screens displayed in set-up mode. The Set-Up Directory
screen enables you to move through the sequence of Set-Up screens &#8211; display,
general, communications, printer, keyboard, tab, graphics (VT240 Series only), and
Telephone (VT220 and VT240).</P>

</TABLE>
<H2>Communications</H2>
<P>The VT220, VT240, and VT241 terminals communicate with a host and a printer via
full-duplex, asynchronous lines only. There are 10 possible transmit/receive speeds
that are selectable in Set-Up. Your VT220 and VT240 Series terminals operate in
accordance with the following national and international communications standards
and recommendations:</P>
<UL>
<LI>EIA Standard RS-232C</LI>
<LI>EIA Standard RS-423</LI>
<LI>CCITT Recommendation V.24</LI>
<LI>CCITT Recommendation V.26 (V.10)</LI>
<LI>CCITT Recommendation V.20 (V.21)</LI>
</UL>
<P>To communicate with the host, the VT220 and VT240 Series terminals use serial
character format, which is selected in Set-Up. Digital recommends that the number
of data bits be the same for the host port and the printer port. The stop and parity
bits, however, can be selected separately for each port.</P>
<H3>Host and Printer Port Interfaces</H3>
<P>Members of the VT200 family have two asynchronous serial ports: one for
communications with a host and another for communication with an auxiliary device
such as a printer. The host port has two physical connectors. The EIA or COMM host
port connector (EIA RS-232C) connects your terminal to a local or remote host. The
20&nbsp;mA host port connects your terminal to a local host. The printer port, with
a single physical connector (RS-232C/RS-423), connects your printer or another
device to your video terminal. On the VT240 Series, the printer port operates as a
serial input channel as well. Devices such as digitizers and tablets can be used to
input data via this port.</P>
<H3>Communications with a Host</H3>
<P>The VT220 and VT240 Series can be directly connected to a local host computer or
via telephone lines to a remote host computer. To communicate with a local host, use
the 20&nbsp;mA current loop connector or EIA host port connector using a null modem
cable. Connection of the VT220 and VT240 Series to a remote host is made via
telephone lines using a modem or acoustic coupler. The modem used at the video
terminal end must be compatible with the modem used at the host computer end. The
VT220 and VT240 Series accept compatible modems and acoustic couplers such as
Bell 103, 113, and 212, including Digital's DF02 and DF03 modems.</P>
<H3>Communications with a Printer</H3>
<P>You can locally connect your VT220 or VT240 Series terminal to an asynchronous
serial printer using the appropriate cable. Digital's current printers can be used
with the VT220 terminal: LA50 Personal Printer, Letterprinter 100, LQP02
Letter-Quality Printer, DECwriter Correspondent, and DECprinter III. Even Digital's
traditional printers, the LA34, LA35, LA36, and LA38, can be used.</P>
<P>The printer port can be used as a serial input channel or input/output device
(VT240 Series), as well as an output device. Choose the mode of operation you want
in Set-Up. When the printer port is selected as an input device in Set-Up
(Printer-to-Host Mode), data from the auxiliary device, as well as data from the
terminal keyboard, can be sent to the host. Data from the printer port is treated
the same as keyboard data.</P>
<P>If in Set-Up you select the printer port as an output device (No Printer-to-Host),
text and graphics print functions can be initiated from the keyboard as well as from
the host. In this mode, input from the printer is disabled.</P>
<P>When the printer port is selected in Set-Up as an input/output device (Printer
Controller Mode), the device connected to the printer port is treated as the
terminal, while the VT240 transparently monitors line traffic. This means all
characters from the host are sent directly to the device connected to the printer
port with the exception of XON, XOFF, NULL, and control functions from the host.
These functions turn the Printer Controller on and off. All characters from the
device are sent directly to the host with the exception of XON, XOFF, and NULL. There
is a 256 character input buffer to support input from the printer port. See the
<CITE>VT220</CITE> and <CITE>VT240 Series Owner's Manuals</CITE> for more details.</P>

<H2>Printing Screen Display</H2>
<P>When you VT220 or VT240 Series terminal is properly connected to an appropriate
printer, you can locally print whatever is on the monitor screen. To print a monitor
screen display that contains only text, press the keyboard PRINT key. This stops all
screen actions and sends the information on the screen to the printer. To abort the
printing process, just press the PRINT key again.</P>
<P>To print a monitor screen display that contains graphics (VT240 Series only),
press SHIFT and PRINT simultaneously. Just as with printing only text, this action
freezes the screen and sends all text and graphics information on the screen to the
printer. If you want to stop the printing process, press SHIFT and PRINT together.</P>
<P>The VT220 and VT240 Series of terminals operate in one of four text print modes.
These modes, selectable in Set-Up, are normal mode, auto print mode, printer
controller mode, and local controller mode.</P>
<H3>Auto Print Mode</H3>
<P>Auto Print mode prints a hardcopy of the current text line before the cursor moves
to the next line. The cursor moves to the next line when the terminal receives a
linefeed, form feed, or vertical tab. When selected, auto print mode is indicated
by a status line in Set-Up. After you have selected Auto Print in Set-Up, invoke
the Auto Print mode by pressing the CTRL and PRINT SCREEN keys. To stop Auto Print
Mode, press CTRL and PRINT keys again.</P>
<H3>Normal Print Mode</H3>
<P>Normal print mode lets you select all local printing functions through the
keyboard.</P>
<H3>Printer Controller Mode</H3>
<P>Printer Controller Mode gives the host direct control of the printer. Characters
received from the host go directly to the printer and are not displayed on the video
screen. When invoked, Printer Controller Mode is indicated by a status line in
Set-Up. This mode cannot be selected from the keyboard, except by entering Set-Up.
Printer Controller Mode does not allow the use of local printing functions, for
example, the PRINT SCREEN does not work.</P>
<H3>Local Controller Mode</H3>
<P>Local Controller Mode is selected by the local and printer controller Set-Up
features in the Set-Up Directory. When these features are selected, Local Controller
Mode supports keyboard output to the printer. This lets you set up various printers
for operation, without involving the host.</P>
<H2>Integral Modem/Auto Dialer (VT240 Series Only)</H2>
<P>The integral modem/auto dialer functions are available if this option is
installed. The integral modem/auto dialer function enables you to:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Allow a video terminal and a telephone to share the same telephone line,
supporting both voice and data communications.</LI>
<LI>Use a telephone for normal voice communication.</LI>
<LI>Use the VT240 terminal keyboard to dial calls to a host instead of using the
telephone as the dialing device.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Three modes of operation are available with the integral modem/auto dialer
options:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Data Mode conditions the terminal for communicating data with the host.</LI>
<LI>Talk Mode lets you use the telephone for voice communication. Entering Talk Mode
automatically aborts data communication with the host.</LI>
<LI>Dialer Mode lets you do three things. First, you can use the keyboard to type
and store telephone numbers to be dialed automatically. Second, you can use a single
keystroke to redial the last telephone number dialed. Third, you can recall and
dial the telephone numbers you have stored in Set-Up.</LI>
