I'll try to look at that.

Well, since bash implements WCE and is the default shell on Linux and
Mac OS X machines, I'd say that such ill-behaved programs should not
be common (and should be fixed). So, IMHO, there would be more benefit
to have WCE in zsh.

Yes, that would be nice, even though a trap emulating WCE could be as
simple (unless there are drawbacks).

In any case, I think that the behavior should be documented.
