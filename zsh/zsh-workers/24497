Actually, there are quite a lot miscellaneous scripts that could
usefully be executable, and some of the functions are dual purpose.
There aren't many of that list that *definitely* shouldn't be
executable.

Configuration is now broken right from the word go:

% sh Util/preconfig
cd . && ./.preconfig
Util/preconfig: line 7: ./.preconfig: Permission denied
Util/preconfig: ./.preconfig failed (status 126)

I made and installed a shell from scratch and ".preconfig" was the
only thing that failed, although it's rather perverse not having the
scripts in Util and Misc executable.
