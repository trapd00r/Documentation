Ah.  Hmm.

This is better.  Specifically, when I type "alias", I see:

  dfn='rxvt +sb -fn "$RXVTNEWSFONT" -geometry 128x51+69+42 \ 
      -e nice /usr/bin/slrn -f /home/keeling/.jnewsrc-dfn \
      -h news.individual.net'

                                                                [s/\\$//g]

... instead of seeing the _expanded_ version of $RXVTNEWSFONT in
there.

Thanks.  Much appreciated.

  --------------------

Perhaps I should start a new thread here, but should I assign any
significance to the fact that bash =~ 0.51 Mb and zsh =~ 0.4 Mb?
Specifically:

  dpkg -l zsh
  ii  zsh   4.0.4-33   A shell with lots of features.

If it's got "lots of features" (presumably, > bash), why's it smaller?
More efficient coding, or does zsh throw out extraneous stuff that bash
cares about?
