Is that really instead of (not in addition to)?  In that case, and
assuming Hcurses is HPUX-specific, I would think we can fix this by
changing

[case "$host_os" in
  hpux10.*|hpux11.*|solaris*)
      termcap_curses_order="curses ncurses termcap" ;;
  *)             termcap_curses_order="termcap curses ncurses" ;;
esac]

to 

[case "$host_os" in
  hpux10.*|hpux11.*|solaris*)
      termcap_curses_order="Hcurses curses ncurses termcap" ;;
  *)             termcap_curses_order="termcap curses ncurses" ;;
esac]

in the configure test.
