One way of doing it is to turn the backup files into the pattern of a set
of alternatives, by joining together with a "|", and then excluding the
matched pattern from the master files using the ":#" parameter operator.

% master_files=(foo bar "funny name" stuff random)
% backup_files=(foo bar "funny name")
% eval print -lr -- '${master_files:#'"("${(j.|.)${(q)backup_files}}")"'}'
stuff
random

I deliberately tried this with a difficult character in the pattern
(actually, I think space would have worked without quoting, but the "(q)"
does quote it, so it should work here like any character that does need
quoting), which is why I ended up with an "eval"; using the GLOB_SUBST
option didn't seem to handle quoting well.

It might be useful to have a special expression for excluding anything that
matches an element of a given array, but there isn't one.
