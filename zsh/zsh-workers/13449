Subject: zsh 3.1.9-dev8 on RedHat 7.1 beta (fisher): success


In case anyone's interested, I build zsh 3.1.9-dev8 on RedHat 7.1 beta
(Fisher) and have been using it for several days with no problems.
The preprocessor bug that caused problems building it in 7.0 is not
present in 7.1.  I haven't tried the latest CVS.
