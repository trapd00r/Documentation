Well, this is not my day. First I had _du in site-functions so nothing
I did fixed it (I figured this out before sending the previous mail).
Then as I was trying to fix _mkdir, I just did a cp **/_mkdir
$fpath[3] to save some time. BUT of course I had -test-3 in that shell
and the new shell had -dev-1 so that copy didn't have any effect. Heh.

Anyway here is a patch for _mkdir:

Subject: [PATCH] _mkdir: don't set ret=3D0 when _wanted fails to find any m=
atches
