zsh-2.5.03.tar.gz contains a ChangeLog from Richard describing changes
between July 20 and August 2, 1994.  There is no other ChangeLog in 2.5.
zsh-2.3.1 has a list of contributors and a changelog in the README but
there are not names in the changelog part.

Perhaps I'll include the current CONTRIBUTORS removing those added during
the 2.6 development (this just means that Wayne Davison and myself will be
removed but not Richard since it seems to me that zsh-2.5.02 and zsh-2.5.03
were put together by him) and rename it to something like CONTRIBUTORS-2.5.

Then I'll create a new file mentioning the major contributors to zsh-3.0
noting that other people who have submitted submitted patches are mentioned
in the ChangeLog.  This means that I do not have to think about what
happened before 2.5.

But these two files may be put together keeping the name CONTRIBUTORS,
perhaps that's even better.

It is partly just my personal curiousity about what happened before I
joined the development.  Peter's original RCS file of the FAQ would tell a
lot about that.  I still hape that he'll find that one day.  The header of
the FAQ included in 2.3.1 is FAQ,v 1.3 1993/02/04 so probably that file
started sometime near the end of 1992 (that's the time when I got my first
Internet account :-)).
