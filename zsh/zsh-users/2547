I found it yesterday. :)  It seems to fix the bugs I reported.  Namely
the completion in $(< and the hash problem when ksharrays is set.
Just curious here.  Why isn't ksharrays the default?  Also, what is
the current goal with regard to development?  Is zsh going to move
towards more ksh93 compliance?  It sure would be nice. :) Things like
read -tn would be nice.
