Hi all,

some time ago I posted that I have problems with capital German umlauts  
not being accepted by zsh on NEXTSTEP, and there were some discussions  
from which I got the impression that somebody would try to fix this  
problem.

However, I haven't heard anything since.

Does someone of the zsh programmers still have this in mind?


                Bye
                        Uli
