} I could finally reproduce it when trying to look at it with strace,
} which finally opened my eyes (I would have needed a `ps j' output).

zsh(28198)-+-pstree(5173)
           `-xterm(5161)---zsh(5162)---mutt(5164)

} It goes like this: Someone exec()s zsh without putting it into its own
} process group. Then we start the function and zsh executes external
} commands in its own process group.

The top-level xterm case is now producing process trees exactly like
the case where there's an intermediate zsh, but the parent zsh is still
not ignoring the TSTP.

} So, if we have agreed to use the kill-loop-patches, we'll have to make 
} sure that every decent interactive zsh with job-control runs in its
} own process group which is what the patch below does.

This is a good idea in any case.
