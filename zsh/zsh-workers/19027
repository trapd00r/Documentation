Hello,

I am trying to compile 4.0.7 on AIX 5.2 using the native compiler.  Below
is what I think are
the relevant parts of the process, but I can send logs if someone wants to
help.  It looks
as though the problem has to do with misconfiguring "cap_get_proc".  I am
able to build
it if I disable the specific ifdef's in utils.c and cap.c but wanted to see
if there is an offical
solution.

I am currently not a subscriber but am willing to help with AIX issues and
have access to
the latest power4 systems as well.

Here is what I get:

...
checking for cap_get_proc in -lcap... no
...
checking for cap_get_proc... yes
...

host operating system     : powerpc-ibm-aix5.2.0.0
