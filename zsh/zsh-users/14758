Hi Marc,

I currently use GnuWin32 as well, if only because I am not aware of 
another currently maintained source of Unix tools. I haven't done speed 
tests between the GnuWin32 tools and Cygwin, but the GnuWin32 tools are 
plenty fast for me. I don't think I would choose shell scripting for an 
application where speed was a priority anyway ;). GnuWin32 provides most 
of the tools a Unix user needs to feel productive, but a Bourne 
compatible shell is a glaring omission.

I'm one of those people who use Linux at home, but am forced to use 
Windows at work. I use WinZsh the same way I use bash/zsh on Linux, both 
as an interactive environment and to write shell scripts. As time goes 
on I'm accumulating a collection of useful shell scripts and becoming a 
better shell programmer. Many of these scripts would be useful on 
Windows as well, however I have no desire to try to rewrite them as Dos 
batch files (if it would even be possible). Powershell may be cool, but 
it's a new language to learn and it's still Windows only so that's a 
deal breaker right there. WinZsh lets me run my shell scripts unmodified 
on Windows, which is pretty cool. Nowadays I even write & test bash/zsh 
scripts on Windows and then run them on my Linux box at home.

I've used Amol's old port for years, and it disappointed me that it was 
unmaintained and was becoming increasingly difficult to find, and seemed 
in danger of disappearing entirely. So eventually I decided to just take 
up maintenance myself, that's the fun of open source right?

The eventual goal is to provide all the features of zsh on Unix.

Cheers,
Tim
