the following is from zsh -f, ^x (execute-named-cmd):

#0  0x080bcfa1 in unmetafy (s=0xb7ce1a94 "execute: ", len=0xbffff058)
    at utils.c:2847
2847        for (t = p; (*t = *p++);)
(gdb) bt
#0  0x080bcfa1 in unmetafy (s=0xb7ce1a94 "execute: ", len=0xbffff058)
    at utils.c:2847
#1  0xb7cda63b in stringaszleline (instr=0xb7ce1a94 "execute: ",
    outll=0xbffff0bc, outsz=0x0) at zle_utils.c:195
#2  0xb7ccb059 in executenamedcommand (prmt=0xb7ce1a94 "execute: ")
    at zle_misc.c:778

e-n-c passes constant prmt that unmetafy is trying to assign to. It is too 
late for me to decide whether all callers of stringaslinezle or it itself 
should provide a writable copy of instr.
