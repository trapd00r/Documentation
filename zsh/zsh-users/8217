yarr mateys!

consider the following:

% touch somefile
% chmod 755 !!:$

 -this essentially will chmod 755 the last arg in the previous history cmd

now then, id like to incorporate this into my .zshrc

something to the effect of:
alias ch="chmod 755 !!:$"

but this produces the error:
chmod: cannot access `!!:$': No such file or directory

apparently its looking for a literal filname of "!!:$"


can anyone out there recommend a way to go about doing this ?
