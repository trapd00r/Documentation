There's also the option appendhistory which you should set.  It's
possible, even so, that it doesn't quite do what you want:  at least,
there have been complaints about the behviour when saving multiple
sessions.  If it still doesn't, complain again (preferably with
examples of how it differs) and I'll have a look at the history code.
