Thanks for spotting this, it's entirely my fault.  When I added `for
vara varb in val1a val1b ...' I tried not to screw up select, but did
anyway (and obviously didn't test it).  The new syntax isn't appropriate
for select.

I've also made select accept an EOF from the keyboard instead of
printing `use 'exit' to exit', which doesn't make any sense except at
the main prompt.  This ought really to be an argument to zleread().
