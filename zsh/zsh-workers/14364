bart
	thanks for getting back to me.  i am using HP-UX 11.0.  as per
your suggestion, i used ansi 'c' compiler instead of gcc and everything
worked fine (both zsh-3.0.8 and zsh-4.0.1-pre-4 got built).

this is what i did:
CC=/opt/ansic/bin/cc ./configure
make
make install

again, thanks very much for your help.

regards,

tapesh
