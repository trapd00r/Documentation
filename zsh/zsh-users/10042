13.1.4 Modifiers
----------------

After the optional word designator, you can add a sequence of one or
more of the following modifiers, each preceded by a `:'.  These
modifiers also work on the result of _filename generation_ and
_parameter expansion_, except where noted.

h
     Remove a trailing pathname component, leaving the head.  This works
     like `dirname'.

r
     Remove a filename extension of the form `.XXX', leaving the root
     name.

e
     Remove all but the extension.

t
     Remove all leading pathname components, leaving the tail.  This
     works like `basename'.
