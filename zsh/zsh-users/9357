I have subtle problems running programs under gdb since I switched to zsh=
=20
and configured a lot of aliases and zsh-specific things. I wonder how do I=
=20
debug it, -- if I start gdb under zsh, what's the startup sequence of the=
=20
new process? For some reason, the examples .zshrc's I see do not distinguis=
h=20
between login shell and non-login one... How does zsh differentiates betwee=
n=20
them, and what happens when gdb starts a process when run under zsh (does i=
t=20
even run zsh, or /bin/sh, and how do they interact)?...
 Cheers,
Alexy
