    Hi all :)

    When I issue delete-word in a line like this:

    asridfds jf'_'invnck fhdsfjh shdfasdf

    where '_' is the cursor position, the entire word jfinvnck is not
deleted, just the portion between the cursor and the end of the word.
That's not what I expect, and the manual is pretty terse: delete-word
delete the current word.

    I'm using 4.0.7, with the default WORDCHARS contents, and I've
noticed that this seems to be the standard behaviour of this kind of
widget: kill-word does the same, backward-delete-word too, etc...

    This is not exactly a problem for me, but before creating a new
widget that deletes from the start of the word using the existing
ones I would like to know if the problem is... me. If I'm doing
something wrong I would like to know O:)

    Thanks a lot in advance :))
