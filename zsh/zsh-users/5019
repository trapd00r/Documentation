Useful, and I use it more often than I'd like, given the sort of things
I end up having to use it for -- killing recalcitrant processes.

Constructs for getting PID listings and storing them in an array, for
later iteration, etc.

Since my employer doesn't have zsh installed by default, except on
machines installed within the last few months (*ahem* guess who wrote
the new installation procedure?), I often end up having to move to Perl.

Some tasks _can_ be done in bash, messing around with extra subshells,
but it gets grotty fast.

zsh keeping the RHS as the parent lets me do a lot of sysadmin tasks
more fluently than using bash or dropping to Perl.
