Hi all,

I've discovered a bug in the sed -i completion :

% sed -i <tab>
suffix for backup
sed script

that's right ... but :

% sed -i 's/x//' <tab>
sed script

wrong ! sed script already written, it's time to give sed filenames.

I'm sorry to not submit a patch but i'm still not skilled with
completion.

regards
mc
