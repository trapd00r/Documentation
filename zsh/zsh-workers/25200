No, $((1 x)) is an invalid expression (unless the shell sees this
as an extension), so POSIX requires it to fail.

This is different from $((1 $x)), where the expansion of $x occurs
first.

So? What's the problem with them not being the same?

Note that POSIX says:

  The shell shall expand all tokens in the expression for parameter
                                                          ^^^^^^^^^
  expansion, command substitution, and quote removal.
  ^^^^^^^^^

  Next, the shell shall treat this as an arithmetic expression
  ^^^^

In the first case, the expression is x = 1 + x. In the second case,
it is 1 = 1 + 1.

I agree that this isn't perfect (BTW, see my mail in the Austin group
when it appears -- I haven't received a copy yet).
