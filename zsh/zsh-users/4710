Is this closer to what you want:

up-line-or-beginning-search-backward() {
  if [[ $LBUFFER == *$'\n'* ]]; then
    zle up-line-or-history
  else
    zle history-beginning-search-backward
  fi
}

zle -N up-line-or-beginning-search-backward

If it is, this was discussed some time around about last November. A
few variations on the idea were posted including a similar function for
forward.
