I wonder if that's a function of your locale ($LANG setting)?  It's
possible it's not translating upper case characters to lower case
properly.  Ah, in fact it probably is...

2007-03-15  Peter Stephenson  <pws@csr.com>

	* 23219: Src/options.c: Ismail DÃ¶nmez reported that lower
	casing of I to dotless i in tr_TR.UTF-8 broke option handling.

I would guess you'll find that any option with an upper case I in it
won't work properly.

Now I look, I've found I've missed a place that needs this fix (although
it doesn't apply here).
