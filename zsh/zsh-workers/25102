Then I'd be inclined to start looking into hardware issues, since
_something's_ probably getting stuck in disk IO; I'll suspect that
before kernel bugs, but it might also be worth seeing if there are other
problems with threaded programs on powerpc, if init really can't reap
something that has already become a zombie.

First line of vmstat is average since system boot, you need to do
something like "vmstat 1", ignore the first line, and look at what's
happening at the current time.
