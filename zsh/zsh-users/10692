These are not global, but suffix aliases.
For a disambiguation of the two, see:

If you do this because of your "preferred scripts", as you said,
create a new directory ~/bin and put your scripts in there, and add
that directory to your path: path=( ~/bin $path );
That way you can call your scripts like normal programs (which is
preferable, IMHO).

If you want those suffix aliases by all means, the only solution I can
think of is this:

[snip]
zsh% print =pv.sh         
/usr/bin/pv.sh
zsh% pv.sh       
usage: /usr/bin/pv.sh page_number file_name[.dvi]
zsh% alias -s sh=/bin/sh
zsh% pv.sh
/bin/sh: Can't open pv.sh
zsh% alias pv.sh=/usr/bin/pv.sh
zsh% pv.sh
usage: /usr/bin/pv.sh page_number file_name[.dvi]
[snap]

You would have to create aliases for all commands in your $path that
end in the extensions you got suffix-aliases. That could be done in a
loop:

[snip]
extensions=( exe py zsh )
for binary in ${^path}/**/*.${^extensions}(N) ; do
  command=${binary:t}
  alias $command=$binary
done
[snap]

Though, I would prefer the ~/bin solution.
