I am just switching to zsh, and I find it really great! Thanks, for giving  
such a nice shell to the public!

I have, however, a small question, which I couldn't answer by searching the  
Manuals and the FAQ: I want my shell to behave differently, if I am logged in  
directly at the console of a machine, or remotely. For this I would like to  
know a condition, that tells me the 'remoteness'.
Is this available, or could this be included (I am using 2.6-beta13)?

Thanks in advance for any help. Please mail the answer directly to me.
