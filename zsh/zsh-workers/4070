Ceteris paribus, I'd agree with your analysis of the above situation.
But to have ${one[1]} expand to "one" when SH_WORD_SPLIT is enabled
might be considered worse.

OTOH, I've been thinking that it might be better to adopt the ksh view
of scalar variables, that they are actually arrays of a single element.
That would make ${one[1]} in the above unambiguously refer to "one",
and make $= behave as you expected.  It would also break a lot of
existing scripts in ways that could only partially be fixed by another
compatibility option.
