Vincent,

Thanks for the feedback, I appreciate it.

Sorry, not subscribed there, only here :).  Sorry I missed your reply.
I didn't want to crosspost per se, but I thought that both lists would
have a number of people perhaps interested.

I checked out the CVS of zsh and verified that the _subversion
(particularly on the svn status line) has changed since what I made my
changes against. (Mine were against 4.2.5).  I have attached a copy of
the module with the changes based against the latest CVS of _subversion
instead.  I haven't tested it as much, but it seems to work fine, tell
me if you run into any more problems.  

Cheers,
Andy
