It's documented in zshcontrib(1), but only in 4.1.  I think I'll copy the
remainder of the bash-* stuff to the 4.0 branch.

The file tells you what to do.  Make sure the directory is in your autoload
path --- zsh should have been set up so that it is --- and autoload it like
any other function.

# This implements a bash-style backward-kill-word.
# To use,
#   zle -N bash-backward-kill-word
#   bindkey '...' bash-backward-kill-word
# or if you wish to replace existing backward-kill-word bindings,
#   zle -N backward-kill-word bash-backward-kill-word
