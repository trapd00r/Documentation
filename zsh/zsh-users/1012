something like %m|^[[31m%B%~%b^[[37m$ is a big problem until now.
is there some hope that can be solved soon.
 what about the possibility to use colors in a prompt.

why do i want it: because i love much information, but it is much, much
easier to see it when different colors are available.
so anyone out there who likes the same and is missing a nice
way to do it at the prompt. i get some unremovable TABS.
i read that there were problems with the zsh here.
any way out?
