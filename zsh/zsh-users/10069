Hum, which version of Zsh you are using? Do you have completion for
other commands working??

All the programs you mentioned already have completion functions for a
while (I just tested zsh 4.1.1) and already what you want by default.

[...]

Though in the latest version of zsh, xpdf completes also cmd line options.

Python was not completing properly some time ago but it has been fixed
in latest version of zsh (I sent the bug report and the silly fix
;-)).

acroread, seems to have a problem (on 4.3.1) (just try to complete a "-"
option)... Perhaps it was one of the commands with problems on the 4.3.2
release?? Can anybody comment on that?

Cheers,
