Subject: Scripting situation I cannot wrap my head around

My apologies for asking you all for what feels like a basic question,
but I am missing something and cannot wrap my head around how to fix
it.

I am currently writing "verbatims" for a class that I am taking.  The
teacher wants the verbatims to include a number for each time a person
has spoken.

An example will make this more clear.  Assume that John, Tim and
George and talking.

Here is "normal" dialog:

John: How are you today?
Tim: I'm good.
George: I'm Ok, how are you
John: I'm good too.
George: Glad to hear it
John: Thanks
Tim: Yeah, me too

Here is verbatim style dialog:

John1: How are you today?
Tim1: I'm good.
George1: I'm Ok, how are you
John2: I'm good too.
George2: Glad to hear it
John3: Thanks
Tim2: Yeah, me too

Notice that the number next to the name represents the number of times
that person has said something (it doesn't matter WHO they said it
to).

What I am trying to do is figure out a way to have the numbering done
for me, but I can't wrap my head around how to do that.  You would
need separate counters for each person, and you wouldn't know how many
people would be a part of the conversation (no fewer than 2 people,
probably no more than 10, usually 2-5).

I've tried to come up with WHILE loops or FOR loops using counters and
such, but I can't get past the first hurdle, which seems to be: how to
keep track of a counter for each speaker when you don't know how many
speakers you will have.

Any help appreciated.  The fact that it's 2:30am may have something to
do with my brain fog (I hope!) so my apologies if I am missing
something obvious!

TjL
