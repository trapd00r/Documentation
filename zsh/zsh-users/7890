run-help and which-command are built-in aliases created by the zsh binary
(they ought to be created by the zsh/zle module as they're used by two of
the default widgets, but for historical reasons they're still created as
part of the regular zsh init).

The path is inherited through the environment, from a default established
by the the login program or the equivalent (whatever it is that waits for
you to type your user name and password, be that xdm or sshd or ...).
