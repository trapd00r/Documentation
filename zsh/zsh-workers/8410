I understand.  I submited the patch because I used to do
ZLS_COLORS=$LS_COLORS and thought most people would do that (in wich
case behaving like GNU ls seems the right thing to do).  Maybe I was
wrong.

This sounds good.  And allow to have file type colored differently
from the filename.

BTW, there is another thing I *do* like in GNU ls, it's its
multi-column's output with variable width for columns.  This allow to
put more files on less lines.  Do you think Zsh could do that too ?
