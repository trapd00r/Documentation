Hmm.

I had a bit of trouble applying this patch, because it includes hunks for
config.h.in -- but config.h.in is in the .cvsignore file, so it's never
included in any of the "cvs co" directories where I apply patches.

Since config.h.in is auto-generated from configure.in, I presume that none
of the changes are actually necessary as long as the configure.in patch
applied successfully?
