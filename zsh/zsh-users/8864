FWIW, I tried this patch:

diff -r1.1 _combination
91c91,93
<   compadd "$@" -a tmp || { (( $+functions[_$key] )) && "_$key" "$@" }
---
>   local expl
>   _wanted $key expl $key  compadd "$@" -a tmp ||
>       { (( $+functions[_$key] )) && "_$key" "$@" }

and it does *not* change the behavior I'm seeing.  I checked functions
to make sure the updated version was cached. :P
