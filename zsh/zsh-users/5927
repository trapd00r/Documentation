I would welcome both the loss of the spam and unecessary bloating of my
mail from text/html messages. Are the hotmail mesages multipart/alternative
with text/html and text/plain versions and if so, can't the mail filter
reformat the message into just text/plain (I know there are external programs
like reformime that can).

There are plenty of XXXX->html converters for all sorts of doc types but I'm
not aware of a html->text converter - everyone seems hellbent on producing
html even if just to be able to print the heading in *boldface*.
