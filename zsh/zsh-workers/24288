Ok, I just did a ^K BS and it output <Nul> instead of <BS>. I can get
around this in vim by mapping <Nul> to <BS> but there's problems sshing
or using any program that uses bs. Anyone know how to change my
backspace key codes? I'm pretty sure that's the problem.  stty erase
blah doesnt seem to work, and I cant force a ttyctl f before running the
screen...
Thanks!
