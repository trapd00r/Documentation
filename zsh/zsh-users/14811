It's probably safest to assume PCRE isn't available:  pcre is often not
a package installed by default, may well not be present at all on
systems that aren't Linux or BSD distributions, and enabling it is a
special configure option.

You probably *can* assume POSIX regular expressions are available, i.e
[[ ... =~ ... ]] with REMATCH_PCRE turned off.  That's tested for in
configure, but I would expect most systems to provide it.
