Remember you need `. compinit -d' or `source compinit -d' to get things to
work --- executing it as a shell script won't do anything.  The bindings
should then be set automatically, provided they were previously bound to
the usual old-style completion functions; you shouldn't need to do any
rebinding yourself.  Try doing `set -x' and seeing what functions get
called when you hit tab; you should start off inside the function
_main_complete.  If nothing at all shows up, then the functions probably
aren't being found, either a problem with $fpath or it hasn't been
autoloaded (or both, if compinit didn't find anything).  Also try
`functions' and see if you get a long list of undefined functions beginning
with `_', as you should.

Somebody will probably write some installation code when they get a chance.
