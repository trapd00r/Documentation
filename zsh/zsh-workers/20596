It's because that's how we do it at CSR, and switching between the two
is too complicated for me.  It's not intentional.

I think this is mostly done by putting the ";" on the next line, which
makes the intention clear enough.  Putting a ";" on the same line
immediately after the loop statement is certainly more bug-prone.

Anything that makes it more readable is fine by me, although it's quite
hard to enforce this sort of nicety.
