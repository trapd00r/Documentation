Subject: trying to learn zstyle

Hi,
	I am trying to learn zstyle to do command completion, but I am
	very very confused how everything works after reading the doc
	and trying out.

	I have the following lines in my .zshrc:

	zstyle ':completion:*:hello:*:hosts' hosts $HOSTS
	zstyle ':completion:*:mtvp:*:hosts' hosts $HOSTS
	zstyle ':completion:*:telnet:*:hosts' hosts $HOSTS

	But all of them behaves differently.

	hello [TAB] gives me a completion of list of files in my current
	dir.

	mtvp [TAB] give me a completion of -display    -geometry

	telnet behaves the way I want, which gives me a list of hosts
	defined in $HOSTS.

	What I am doing wrong?

	How do I use zstyle to make mtvp to complete to the files with
	*.mpg or *.mpeg or *.MPG and so on.

	Thanks for the help very much.

Shao.
