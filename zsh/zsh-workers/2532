I see the point, but do you really want to try and explain this to the
average user?  ``The PATH is sometimes empty, and sometimes really empty,
but only if you set it as an array; if it looks empty, it may be empty
or really empty; if it's empty but not really empty it pretends to be
set to the current directory...''

Besides which, when passed as an environment variable --- even down to another
zsh --- the only possibilities are either not having it set or an empty
PATH (which is therefore not really empty in the above sense).

Still, there's some confusion in having both $path and $PATH which is
probably unavoidable, so I can live with it.
