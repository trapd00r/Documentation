Some of them (mostly utility functions that are useful in building your
own) are described in manual, Completion system. Man zshcompsys or
info->Completion System.

If you want to write completion for some command, I recommend look at
_arguments (documentation may be better, sigh). It allows describing
options and arguments in simple table form without almost any shell
code. Else look in zsh source tree, Completion/*.
