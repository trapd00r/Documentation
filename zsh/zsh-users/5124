yes, but if the From address is forged, isn't there a good chance that
the person whose address is in the From: header isn't a subscriber?

anyway piping the list through demime might help a bit, although a lot
of viruses would still get through that.  i am not worried about being
infected, but it is a waste of time and bandwidth for all parties
involved.

also, closing the list (or better, requiring confirmation for posts from
non-list members) would still cut out most / all of the spam that gets
sent to this list.

i haven't personally used TMDA, and it looks like it's a bit of a pain
to setup, but it would be good for this sort of thing (and i'd imagine
it can be configured to work with qmail / EZMLM).

just my $0.02
