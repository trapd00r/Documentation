Hi,

I know that. I wrote "(And yes, I know I can add \, but I liked it when
the completion added it for me...)" in my previous mail. I just see no
reason why the shell is completing environment variables there. If there
is a good reason, I would like to have the possibility to restore the
old behavior...

Greetings, Tobi
