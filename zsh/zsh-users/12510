This reminds me that I wanted to ask a question about _svn:

With _cvs, the commit contextual completion offers only files that have
been touched since the last cvs update.  With _svn, it completes with
everything in the directory, instead of only what has changed.

Is that a limitation imposed by svn, or just a design difference?
