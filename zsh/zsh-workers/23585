Thanks for trying it.

I forgot that %e doesn't use errno directly, it expects an argument
(that's because sometimes we save the number and do something else
before reporting the error).

I've also reset errno to 0 beforehand, on the off chance that one of the
possible failures doesn't set errno.  I don't think that should happen,
but I don't want a stray ENOENT from a previous error confusing the
matter.
