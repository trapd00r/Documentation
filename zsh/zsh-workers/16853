Subject: special/readonly variables in sh emulation

I've recently set /bin/sh to be zsh on my Debian Linux box to see what
if any problems occur.

The only problem with the init scripts was this:
/etc/rcS.d/S45mountnfs.sh:29: options: attempt to set slice of associative array

The offending line is:
   while read device mountpt fstype options

Everything else was fine including several configure scripts until I
tried to configure, of all things, zsh:

./configure:10594: functions: attempt to set slice of associative array

We perhaps ought to rethink the status of any special variables
in sh emulation mode. Especially those which are autoloaded out of
places like zsh/parameter. Any ideas on how to solve this?

Oliver
