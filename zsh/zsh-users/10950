Maybe something like:

SAVED_DIRSTACK=~/.zsh-dir-stack-shared
get_saved_dirstack() {
  [[ -r $SAVED_DIRSTACK ]] &&
    . $SAVED_DIRSTACK
}
save_dirstack() {
  print -r "dirstack=(${(@qq)dirstack})" > $SAVED_DIRSTACK
}

functions[preexec]+='
  get_saved_dirstack'
functions[chpwd]+='
  save_dirstack'

(untested).
