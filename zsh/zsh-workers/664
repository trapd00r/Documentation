				well - it's not quite a bug. GNU termcap v1.3 has entries that
are longer than 1023 bytes, so it'll quite happily SEGV when setting
TERM to certain values (like linux, for example, which is a bit of a
bummer). here's two ways around it - change termbuf[1024] into
termbuf[2500] in globals.h, or link with ncurses rather than termcap
(though i'm not certain when ncurses added termcap emulation -
1.9.7/2.1 definitely has it). alternatively, you can tell me to stop
using it (i've been kicking myself for not making a backup of my old
libtermcap ever since i installed it), and get a real termcap
library. thanks for your time.
