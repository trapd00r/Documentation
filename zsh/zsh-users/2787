Hi,
	Somehow, I found the old command completion style is easier to
	understand and has more documentation.

	I am wondering, is the old command completion style going to be
	obsoluete? Or it is going to co-exist with the new command
	completion style?

	Where can I find more info about the new completion style?

Shao.
