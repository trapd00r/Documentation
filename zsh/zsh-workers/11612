} ksh behaves the same way as zsh.

That's probably -why- zsh behaves that way, then.

} IMHO the bash behavior is the most reasonable one.

I think they're both strange.  Look at what happens to zsh scripts when
you put a `set a b c d e' in /etc/zshenv.  (Bash doesn't have that problem
because it has no init scripts that are run for non-interactive shells,
but the principle is the same.)

The positionals should be local, always.  Unfortunately that probably
breaks some expectation of old Bourne shell scripts, or some such.
