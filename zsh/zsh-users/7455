No; please please don't do this.  Consider:

	foo='x*'

	print ${~foo}*

Or

	bar="$foo*"
	print $~bar

Completely unexpected results.

Also it seriously breaks sh compatibility, so at the very least it should
be disabled when SH_GLOB or similar options are in effect.

There's a reason that only **/ and not blather**/ is special.
