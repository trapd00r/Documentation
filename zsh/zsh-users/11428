Hi

I much too frequently write the following

cp _!^ _!$

Which I'd like to shorten somehow and save my sore pinkies.

Ideally I'd use an alias but aliases don't know about history commands.
I guess I could write a script, but what I'd really like is some kind of 
keyboard macro which would spit out the above if I typed say cpfl (copy first 
to last)

Ideas? I'd use Shortkeys but that doesn't work on De-Vista-ted
