Subject: PATCH: _mutt option repetition
Message-ID: <20000722003819.A17534@scowler.net>
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
User-Agent: Mutt/1.0.1i

I was bitten when trying to complete arguments to multiple -a's.
The same applies for -b and -c, but not, as I had suspected, -i.
