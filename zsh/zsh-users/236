Since folks are talking about what a future zsh might have, here is my
idea:

Zsh would be able to automatically figure out what each program might
need for options/arguments and do completion accordingly.

This would require that every program have some way to tell zsh what
its options are, so this idea is pretty far-fetched.

GNU programs have the --help option.  The output format of "find
--help" is meant to be viewed by a person, not parsed by a program, so
perhaps if there were a --synopsis option or something.

The first time a zsh user runs the "find" program, zsh would run "find
--sysopsis" and parse the output to create a completion map for that
command and cache the results.

Auto-created completion.
