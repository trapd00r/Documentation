Subject: PATCH: distribution documentation files
Date: Fri, 04 Apr 2003 14:06:33 +0100
Message-ID: <7347.1049461593@csr.com>
From: Peter Stephenson <pws@csr.com>

Patches for information files in the distribution for 4.1.  I couldn't
think of any obvious incompatibilities with 4.0, can anyone?

The main documentation probably needs a read through again.  In fact, I
suspect the completion documentation still needs a write through.

 Possible incompatibilities
 ---------------------------
 
-Some particular differences you may notice between version 3.0 and 4.0
-(mostly based on 3.0.8; there are other differences from earlier versions):
+Some particular differences you may notice since version 4.0:
 
-  o  The options ALWAYS_LAST_PROMPT (return to the line you were
-     editing after displaying completion lists) and LIST_AMBIGUOUS
-     (don't do AUTO_LIST if there was an unambiguous prefix that could be
-     inserted, i.e. only list if it is ambiguous what to insert next) are
-     now set by default.  This is in response to complaints that too many
-     zsh features are never noticed by many users.  To turn them off,
-     just put `unsetopt alwayslastprompt listambiguous' in your
-     .zshrc file.
-  o  The editor commands history-search-{forward,backward} are implemented
-     slightly differently, as are {up,down}-line-or-search.  You may
-     well not notice this, however.
-  o  Cursor keys are now usually bound in both vi command and insert
-     mode.  In the latter case, this may result in a slight delay after
-     hitting ESCAPE to exit insert mode.  Purists who object to this can
-     unbind the appropriate key sequences (see zshzle(1)).  Most beginning
-     users of zsh apparently find the current behaviour preferable.
-  o  History file format is incompatible with versions older than 3.0.6,
-     but this should only affect people who try to share history files
-     between the two versions -- 4.0 can read the old format, 3.0.6 and
-     later can read the new format.  Just beware of INC_APPEND_HISTORY,
-     which could conceivably mix the two.
-  o  Default compctl completions have been removed for some builtin
-     commands.  Either use the new compinit-derived system, use the
-     improved compctls from Misc/compctl-examples, or restore these
-     equivalents yourself:
-	 compctl -b bindkey
-	 compctl -v export typeset vared
-	 compctl -o setopt unsetopt
-         compctl -c which
+The bash-compatibility zle functions described in the zshcontrib manual
+page have been removed as a more configurable set of editing widgets for
+dealing with words have been added.  The following code in .zshrc will set
+up for bash-style word handling:
+  autoload -U select-word-style
+  select-word-style bash

 CHANGES FROM PREVIOUS VERSIONS OF ZSH
 -------------------------------------
-				     
+
+New features between zsh versions 4.0 and 4.1
+---------------------------------------------
+
+Configuration:
+- upgraded to use autoconf post-2.50
+- improved compatibility with other shells through shell options,
+  builtin arguments and improved builtin option parsing
+
+Syntax and builtins:
+- new printf builtin
+- `+=' to append to parameters which works for scalars, arrays and (with
+  pairs) associative arrays.
+- enhanced multiple parameter `for' loops:
+    for key value in key1 value1 key2 value2 ...
+  maintaining full compatibility with POSIX syntax
+
+Add-on modules and functions:
+- zsh/net/tcp module provides builtin interface to TCP through ztcp
+  builtin.  Function suite for interactive and script use with expect-style
+  pattern matching.
+- zsh/net/socket module provides zsocket builtin.
+- zcalc calculator function with full line editing.
+- builtin interface to pcre library
+- zsh/zselect module provides zselect builtin as interface to select
+  system call
+
+Completion system:
+- general improvements to command and context support, low-level functions,
+  display code.
+- in verbose mode, matches with the same description are grouped
+- highly configurable completions for values of specific parameters,
+  specific redirections for specific commands
+- support for bash completion functions (typically zsh native functions are
+  more powerful where available)
+- New completions provided for (some of these may be in later 4.0
+  releases):  valgrind, tidy, texinfo, infocmp, Java classes, larch, limit,
+  locale parameters, netcat, mysqldiff, mt, lsof, elinks, ant, debchange
+  (dch), email addresses, file system types, Perforce, xsltproc.
+
+Line editor:
+- special parameters $PREDISPLAY, $POSTDISPLAY available in function
+  widgets to configure uneditable text (for narrowing)
+- recursive editing
+- supplied widgets read-from-minibuffer, replace-string use these features
+  (more intuitive prompting and argument reading than 4.0)
+- access to killed text vai $CUTBUFFER and $killring
+- supplied highly configurable word widgets forward-word-match etc., can
+  set what constitutes a word interactively or in startup script
+  (implement bash-style behaviour, replacing previous bash-* word widgets)
+- interface to increment search via $LASTSEARCH
+- better handling of keymaps in zle and widgets
+- better support for output from user-defined widgets while zle is active
+- tetris game which runs entirely in zle
+
+Local internal improvements:
+- disowned jobs are automatically restarted
+- line numbers in error messages and $PS4 output are more consistent
+- `=prog' expands only paths, no longer aliases for consistency
+- job display in prompts; `jobs' command output can be piped
+- prompts: new $RPROMPT2, %^, %y, enhanced %{, %}, %_.
+- rand48() function for better randomness in arithmetic
+  (if the corresponding math library function is present)
+- $SECONDS parameter can be made floating point via `typeset -F SECONDS'
+  for better accuracy
+- improvements to command line history mechanism
+- many bugfixes
+
+
