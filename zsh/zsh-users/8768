The whole keeper function suite is in the development version of zsh,
available from CVS on sourceforge:  Functions/Zle/keeper

You need at least zsh-4.2.2 to run that edition of the suite, as it
has been updated to use the "always" syntax.

(I presume one of those is supposed to mention "insert".)

You're missing a couple of "zle -C" commands; go back and look at the
article again.  There should be a total of three "zle -C" commands in
the final script, but you've only included one of them.

Also ...

You don't need to define the "keep" function twice.
