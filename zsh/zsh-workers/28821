Here's one: When using the git-branch completion, the `-d' option (`-D'
likewise) offers the `-r' option. But then doing:

zsh% git branch -D -r <tab>

does not offer remote branches but just local ones.

Also when reversing the options:

zsh% git branch -r -<tab>

doesn't offer `-d' or `-D' and

zsh% git branch -r -d <tab>

only offers a few more options, but no non-option parameters at all.
