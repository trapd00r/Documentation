What's going on here? With -f:

  % a='a{b,c}d'
  % b=( ${${(q)a}:gs/\\{/{/:gs/\\}/}/} )
  % echo $b
  a{b,c}d                       # OK
  % setopt braceccl
  % b=( ${${(q)a}:gs/\\{/{/:gs/\\}/}/} )
  % echo $b
  a,d abd acd

Oops. (Yes, works with just `echo ${${(q)a}...}', too.)


Aha! It's the `{' and `}' in the replacements strings. They get
tokenized by the lexer, etc. etc.

Urgh. How... What... Where...

Bye
 Sven
