Subject: PATCH: another double-width character fix

This came up when inserting a string of double-width characters then
going back and inserting an ordinary character in front.  The tortuous
logic intended to ensure we didn't stop in the middle of a double-width
character in the old line meant it went too far along the new line and
tried to output a null.
