Say that I have

#compdef craptastic

_arguments \
  '-s[omething]:with an argument' \
  '*:directory:_directories'

Then, at least with my setup, if I have the following command line and
press <Tab> I get:

% craptastic -s <Tab>
::: with an argument :::

but if I have the following and press <Tab> I get:

% craptastic src -s <Tab>
::: with an argument :::
::: directory :::

Why is directory all of a sudden a viable option here?

It makes no sense.  No banging my fists against my head has made me
any wiser (and, believe you me, I've tried...repeatedly).

  a really f:ing pissed off nikolai
