} In fact this would be useful if somebody want to change a
} shellscript's behavior to not abort more than the current program on
} SIGINT and go forward with the next statement in the script.

No; if the shell doesn't un-ignore the signal, then any program that
is started from the script will also still have SIGINT ignored, and
(unless *that* program re-handles the signal) neither the script nor
its children will be interruptible.
