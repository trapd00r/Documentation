Have you tried e.g.

  cp -r -s $PWD/baz ~/baz

??

Assuming you have access to GNU "cp".

I have a zsh function called "ltree" (no relation to the sorting
algorithm) that I wrote back in 1996 to copy directories by hard
or symbolic linkage; but I haven't used it in probably 10 years and
it certainly hasn't been confirmed to work with zsh newer than
3.0.x (and maybe not even that new), so I'm hesitant to post it.
