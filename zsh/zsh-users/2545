Only one more comment: once such a pipe is suspended, the shell
builtin/construct at the end is put in a sub-shell (and the
environment of the parent won't change any more, of course).

This has caused some trouble lately... (but you *can* suspend such
pipes and if you don't do that you can use parameters changed there -- 
its an attempt to get the best of both worlds).
