:${i:s/foo/bar/} does work (and has worked for years and years), you
:just need the final / (though I'm working on that, too), but no-one
:has.  I can't believe no-one else knew?

We just didn't want to add noise to the discussion.  I've always used
${i:s/foo/bar/} and didn't really know about $i(:s/foo/bar) until this
discussion.  But finding out $i(:....) is good too, not that I'll ever use
it since I've been typing ${i:...} for years.  See, now you've just got
more noise on the list :-)
