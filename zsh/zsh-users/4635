Sorry for the late reply.

I'm not really sure I understand what you mean, though. Do you want to
be able to move the cursor inside menu selection with `j', `k', etc.?

You can always define that yourself with

  bindkey -M menuselect 'j' ...

and so on.

I'm not sure I'd like changing the behaviour of these keys in menu
selection even if the user normally uses vi keybindings, because such
`normal' keys currently should leave menu selection and immediately
execute the key's normal function which seems very sensible to me.

Bye
  Sven
