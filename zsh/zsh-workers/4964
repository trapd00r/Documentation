Hi

The zsh-announce, zsh-users and zsh-workers mailing lists has been
moved from math.gatech.edu to sunsite.auc.dk. All old subscribers has
also been transfered, so there is no need to re-subscribe. The old
message archive will be transfered to the new list system next
week. Message numbering is continuing from the old sequence.

The new lists is run by ezmlm, so the procedure to subscribe and
unsubscribe as well as archive retrieval is changed a little. To
unsubscribe, just email to zsh-announce-unsubscribe@sunsite.auc.dk and
to subscribe, just mail to zsh-announce-subscribe@sunsite.auc.dk and
similar for the zsh-users and zsh-workers lists.

For more information on how to use the list system, just mail to
zsh-announce-help@sunsite.auc.dk.

If you have problems or questions, please contact 
zsh-announce-owner@sunsite.auc.dk, which will be read by a human
(well...Me :-)

For more information on ezmlm, please see www.ezmlm.org.

Thanks a lot to Richard Coleman for hosting the zsh mailing lists the
last 4 years!!!

Best regards,
Karsten
SunSITE Denmark admin, and now zsh list maintainer.
