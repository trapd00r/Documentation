} Here is the patch. Lotsa `#if's.

I slightly disapprove of using `#if 0' when it's scattered around like
that.  Suppose we ever want to re-enable it:  How does someone other than
Sven know which `#if 0' to remove and which ones to leave behind?

Not a big deal right now because there aren't any other #if in that file,
but ... perhaps put a comment on each #if line?
