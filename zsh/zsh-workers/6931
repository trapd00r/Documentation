I was going to complain about this myself.  Not only that, but I somehow
managed to get it to set FPATH to a string consisting of a space-separated
list of the dirs in which the functions were installed.  (That made it as
easy as "vared fpath<RET><RET>" to get the path set correctly, but it sure
was confusing.)

} Hmmm ... in command line editing multiline input I can insert new line by

I can insert one with ESC-return, and though "bindkey -m" doesn't make that
equivalent to alt-return, "bindkey '\M-\C-M' self-insert-unmeta" does so.
