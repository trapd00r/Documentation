Yes.  One of the things I had thought about trying to write several
times but never came around to really trying.  It's one of the things
inherited from the times before I started hacking zsh (the fact that, as
Alexandre said, the code doesn't store the type character with the
matches or uses it in its calculations and that it use spaces instead of
empty strings for normal files).
