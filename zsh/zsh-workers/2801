I suppose this is just my ignorance, but I was amazed to discover just
now (playing with the history lines thing) that the `mark' in zle is
not a mark at all, just a character offset which is confused by
insertion and deletion.  Shouldn't it be possible to do something
about this by adding code to spaceinline(), backkill/del(),
forekill/del() -- or are there hidden problems?
