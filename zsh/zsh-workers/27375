Hi Bart,

Duh.. see below.  It's just not considering the last word from the
line when generating the ignore pattern.  What I think is needed is to
generally remove the current word from incorporation into the ignore
pattern, but I don't know how to do that.  If I knew how to relate
$CURRENT to an element of $line that would do it.
