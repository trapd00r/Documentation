Not very useful, except maybe to avoid the use of typeset.

typeset -A a
a=(foo bar)

can be written:

: ${(AA)=a::=foo bar}

You could use "${${(@qqkv)A}[*]}"
$ typeset -A A
$ A=("foo" "b bar" \' \" "" q)
$ print -lr "${${(@qqkv)A}[*]}"
'' 'q' 'foo' 'b bar' ''\''' '"'

So that in the function you can have

typeset -A local_hash
eval "local_hash=($1)"

or:

typeset -A local_hash
local_hash=("${(Q@)${(z)1}}")
