} It also screws everything up completely, appearing at that point.  That's
} why I tried to do the minimum, saving the options to an ordinary array,
} first.

Right, sorry, I noticed that just after I'd sent the message.

I think actually that the "emulate" could just be discarded entirely from

matter, pattern matching with (...|...) works even with kshglob, and there
are no ordinary arrays to be affected by ksharrays.
