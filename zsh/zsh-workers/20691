YMMV.

~$ tail --version
tail (coreutils) 5.2.1
[...]
~$ tail -1 /dev/null
~$

tail -n 1, even if POSIX, is not portable. I think I've come
across a system where it was not supported recently (maybe
Solaris).

Maybe:

dircount() { print $((${${(z)${(f)"$(dirs -v)"}[-1]}[1]} + 1)); }

Or:

dircount() { dirs -v | awk '{n=$1}END{print n+1}'; }
