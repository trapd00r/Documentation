The trouble is syntactical stability.  As things have been, you'd have to
alter your completion stuff completely with each release, which I think is
a bit much even for a beta release.  But now that's got more stable, we
should certainly go for 3.1.7 early in the new year.  I style have to fix
typeset, traps and compinstall.  Grmp.

I'll try to send 3.1.6-pws-12 to the main archive later today, it might get
the development versions a bit more exposure.
