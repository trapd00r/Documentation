Peter,
I've just tried using zftp (on cygwin) it's marvellously intutive, I wrote a script to upload a file
in seconds and it worked straightway without any fiddling!!!

I had been scared by the idea of installing zftp but that's simple

here's my script

cd /my_local_directory
# init zftp
autoload -U zfinit  
zfinit
# login & connect
zfparams www.rayninfo.co.uk myuserid mypassword
zfopen
# lets ftp a file
zfput my_local_file.html
zfls -l my_local_file.html
