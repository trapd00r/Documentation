IMHO there can be no 4.2 unless module dependency problem is fixed
(dynamic modules that depend on other dynamic modules).

To remind - it is impossible to dlopen() a shared object that has
unresolved data objects even on Linux, that currently rules out any
solution that encodes dependencies in binary itself.

Two possible solutions are

- major rewrite that will eliminate external variables completely. It
may even make code cleaner and create basis for some interesting things
(line multiple ZLE instances) as example

- adding external files that are installed together with binary shared
object and describe dependencies for Zsh.
