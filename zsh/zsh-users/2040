I'd like to see more tutorial-style documentation.  Not just reference
material, but something showing me how to use zsh for things I'm
likely to want to do.  

(Aside: one thing that really annoys me is computing magazines
comparing Unix command lines to DOS.  The DOS command line is crud,
but that doesn't imply that all command lines are crud.  But if you
come to bash or zsh from DOS, then probably you wouldn't see anything
other than an irritatingly case-sensitive DOS, simply because you
wouldn't know what to do with all the extra stuff.)

There's a potential problem of market: does anyone have any idea how
many people use zsh?  I'd buy an O'Reilly book on it.

I don't see a problem in that.

Alternatively, you could help to improve the documentation that comes
with zsh.  That would have the disadvantages that you wouldn't get any
money from it, and there wouldn't be a nice printed version (which
would be nice).  But even if O'Reilly (or whoever) turned down your
proposal, you could still contribute to the free documentation.

"Linux Programming Tools" has a chapter on zsh, but it's horribly
limited.  It doesn't even mention things like $(...), which also exist
in bash.  It's not a bad book, but I certainly wouldn't recommend it
as anything other than an imperfect reference book.  The Tcl/Tk tables
use an invalid syntax, too.
