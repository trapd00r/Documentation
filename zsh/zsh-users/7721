Yes, I said something about that before.  This is as close as you can get 
to what was asked for, but (a) it's still not precisely the same [*] as if 
both streams went directly to a single TTY, and (b) you can't invoke it 
blindly/automatically on every spawned command, because it will play havoc 
with any text editor or other fullscreen UI.

[*] E.g. your sample program always writes stdout first and then stderr, 
even when both are found to be available by the same call to select().
