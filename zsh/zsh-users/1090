I don't know if any of you are familiar with mush but it is basically a
mail program based on csh and Mail. It has some very cunning and
powerful features but is a bit old, unreliable and very hard to compile. 

Anyway, I was thinking that it might be possible to write a zsh dynamic
module which when loaded in gave you all the features of mush but used
the command-line and script handling of zsh.

Does anyone else think that this would be a good idea, have any
suggestions or think they might want to help with writing it?

For more information about mush, see:
