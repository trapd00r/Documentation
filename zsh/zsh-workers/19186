Hi,

For quite a while now, every now and then I'll type "cd=20
<some_letters><tab>" and zsh will get very confused, dump some ldap=20
directory information to the screen in binary and stay stuck in this=20
mode until I press ^D.

This has happened twice to me today, though I can't seem to figure out=20=

how to reliably reproduce it. Has anyone noticed this before?

Any info appreciated. Thanks.

Cove

E.g.
