You might want to check into something like SFS:

    http://www.fs.net/

The Self-certifying File System lets users securely share resources
between systems.  It's not yet release-quality code, but several
developers have been using it without lost data for several years now.
I haven't tried it yet, but it looks very interesting to me.
