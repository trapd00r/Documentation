I'm a bit confused (well, perhaps more than a bit  :)  ).

What does !^<tab> expand to.  Is it the first argument of the preceding
command?  What does the # do?

Thanks in advance,

Oh, excellent. I've been wondering for ages if there's such a thing and
never got around to hunting it.

A related joy: !$ tab-expands to last word of previous line. Notably this
has a corresponding keypress, M-. or M-_  Is there a key for !#^ as well?
