Hi all,

I'm giving zsh a try after using tcsh for most of my life, and I'm having a
pretty good time with it so far.  2 things - how would I make it so I could
type in ssh dthiel@red (tab) and have it complete to ssh
dthiel@redundancy.redundancy.org, or if I type in ping deepthought.red (tab)
and have it complete in the same way?  Also, does anyone know how to get the
mailchecking functional with Maildir format mailboxes?

Thanks much,
David
