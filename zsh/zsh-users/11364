My zsh doesn't seem to have a -0 print option.

Maybe print -f '%s\0' ...

Also, you may want to use xargs -r0

It should be noted that xargs -0 is  GNU or BSD specific.

--target-directory is GNU specific.

zmodload zsh/files and mv becomes a builtin, so the problem
disappears along with eventual compatibility issues and you can
even do:


mv ../../cur/* /back/up/folder

You can also speed things up with:

mv ../../cur/*(oN) /back/up/folder

to prevent zsh from sorting the files which may not be necessary
here.
