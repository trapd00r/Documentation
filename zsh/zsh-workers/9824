zsh 433 % /usr/bin/X11/imake <TAB>-display      
-display    -geometry

Not very useful.  OTOH, /usr/openwin/bin/imake will
complete files, which is perhaps more desirable in
this instance.  Since not every binary in */X11/*
is going to take -display and -geometry, and most
are likely to take other arguments, a better solution
is needed.
