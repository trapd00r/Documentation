List,

I figured out the expectations of zsh v. tcsh, save "set ellipsis"...  
zsh seems to be able to do this, but I can't sort out the syntax  
using '%<...<%/'

For example:

user@host [...seg1/seg2/seg3] % in tcsh might be set with:

     set prompt = "%n@%m %B[%b%c3%B]%b %% "
     set ellipsis

In zsh, I can get everything but the ellipsis to behave, e.g.,

%
% cd really/deep/path/to/resource
% print -rP '%n@%m %B[%b%3~%B]%b %# '
user@host [path/to/resource] %
%

My various uses of the truncation syntax can't give me the "ellipsis"  
I hope for... any hints? Maybe I'm fretting to much, but given some  
of the really complex options and sample paths I've seen, mine must  
be simple... right? :)

Thanks in advance,
Tim
