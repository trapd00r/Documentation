You must have pretty old version.

bor@itsrm2% texi2html --version
1.64
bor@itsrm2% ll zsh.html
-rw-r--r--   1 bor      sinix      20737 Jun 28 17:21 zsh.html

Actually, older versions produce buggy html files, so if it the same version
you use for generating zsh-doc you may consider upgrading it.

Anybody knows if texi2html is still supported/developed? Home page was not
updated for almost a year and CVS repository is broken:

bor@itsrm2% cvs up
? doc/texinfo.tex
cvs server: failed to create lock directory in repository
`/usr/local/Singular/cvsroot/Texi2html': Permission denied
cvs server: failed to obtain dir lock in repository
`/usr/local/Singular/cvsroot/Texi2html'
cvs [server aborted]: read lock failed - giving up
