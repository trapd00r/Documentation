You can force a script to be run in interactive mode by including "-i"
in the options to the shell.  This may have side effects, however.

I suspect this is coming from the trashzle() when ZLE exits.  This is
quite well buried.

I'm too lazy to try it, but if you have a sufficiently recent zsh you
could try something like

zle-line-init() { stty onlret; }
zle -N zle-line-init

before vared.
