I have uploaded a test version for 4.2.1:

ftp://ftp.zsh.org/pub/development/zsh-4.2.1-test-A-doc.tar.bz2
ftp://ftp.zsh.org/pub/development/zsh-4.2.1-test-A-doc.tar.gz
ftp://ftp.zsh.org/pub/development/zsh-4.2.1-test-A.tar.bz2
ftp://ftp.zsh.org/pub/development/zsh-4.2.1-test-A.tar.gz

(The name was chosen mainly so that the shell function is-at-least
doesn't think it's a version after 4.2.1.)

If this version doesn't fix any bug you've reported, please report it
again.
