Maybe this problem I am having is actually related to another, very
irritating, problem and like the problem previously mentioned I don't
understand why it's happening... The below screenshot[1] is when I run
my Gnome session from GDM it doesn't happen when I ran it from usual
startx command, I really don't get it, what would be different when I
start my Gnome session from GDM or from startx ??

Take a look at this screenshot[1], it speaks for itself...

I tried what Andrei has found and Actually the terminfo is returning
weird values...
