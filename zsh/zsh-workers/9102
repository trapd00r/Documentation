This shouldn't be happening.

Clearly, $modfile is empty here.  That indicates that xmods.conf lists a
module that doesn't exist (or at least isn't in the module index).  Do you
perhaps need to do a "make prep", having applied my module names patch?

Your patch shouldn't be used, I think.  $modfile being blank here is an
error; if it is to be detected, then an error message should be generated.
