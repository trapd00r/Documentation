And I do still give the simpler 1-echo alternative for those that can't
use the 3-echo version.  There's probably even be a way to code up a
check for the termcap module and the RI capability, but that seems like
overkill to me.

Interesting!  One way to deal with that would be to output some
characters other than spaces that would only become visible when zsh
makes a partial line visible.  For instance:

	echotc so
	echo -n '[EOL]'
	echotc se
	echotc RI $((COLUMNS - 7))
	echo -n '  '

That puts a standout-string "[EOL]" at the end of the output.  I like
the extra indication that the output did not end with a newline.  What
do you think?
