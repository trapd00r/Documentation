I guess he is lazy enough to want to get this without having to type
the `*'s. Some time ago I posted a patch that added partial word
completion, case insensitive completion, and an option called autoglob 
which implemented this. Andrew decided that it shouldn't go into the
baseline. I have some ideas (based upon some older ideas from Peter)
for a suggestion to control the matching behaviour of completion
in a zsh'ish way, so that it should be powerful enough to get this and 
other things. You will hear more about this when (and if) I find some
time to implement it so that you can play with it.

And while I'm at it... our network acces works again for some days now 
and it seems that I received all messages from the list, so I guess
noone has found the time/was interested enough to look at my last
patch, right?

Bye
 Sven
