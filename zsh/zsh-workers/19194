    If this is done, be sure than then I *will* use zstyle to store
state information }:)))

    Seriously, this is a pretty good idea, although I think that the
automatic reload is a good thing. Make persistence optional, but
optional in both ends: saving and reloading. If style persistence is
active, then both save and reload automatically. If it's disabled,
don't save nor reload automatically. This can be controlled by an
option (persistent_styles maybe?), like history.
