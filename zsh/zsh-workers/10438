Feature.  The lack of this kind of convention is one of the things that
bugged me about the old single-maintainer repository system.

In my personal repository, I always used to include the patch number
(from the mailing list) in the log message.  This doesn't make it *easy*
to extract the patch from the archive, but it makes it possible (it
certainly points you towards a good set of date tags to compare), and in
cases where the patch exists separately (e.g., it's on the mailing list)
it provides a handy reference.  If we're going to have patches in CVS
that don't appear on the mailing list, it's still possible to come up with
unique IDs: we just need to each keep track of our own sequence numbers.

The pseudo-label "HEAD" is supposed to evaluate to the latest
version on the trunk.  Does this web interface accept version labels?
