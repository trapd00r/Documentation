Try a combination of AUTO_LIST and NO_LIST_AMBIGUOUS:

  setopt autolist
  unsetopt listambiguous

Just btw: the use of `menu' in your mail is somewhat irritating
because, as I think, you really only want a list. Menuing is done with
AUTO_MENU or MENU_COMPLETE or the `menu' style. And menuing with a
list sounds like menu selection, where you can move the cursor in a
listing to select matches (turned on with the `select' value of the
`menu' style).


Bye
