I'm trying to get the let function to work.  I need to do some integer
based math in the shell, and it seems to be what I want, but I can't get
the thing to work.  Could someone either post or email directly to me a
couple three examples of let?  I would be most appreciative.

Or tell me what part of the man pages I overlooked in my search for help?
:)

Thanks in advance;
Jason
