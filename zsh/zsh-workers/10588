Thanks for the explanation.  I've upgraded my remarks in the user guide
(which actually already gave half the story) to say `don't use tag-order
with files'.

I was still struck by one slight hickup:  I expected to be able to say
'*.lst:globbed-files *(-/):directories' to get them named differently but
called at the same time, but it seems you have to do
'*.lst *(-/):globbed-files' which kind of defeats the object of giving them
a name.  But maybe I've missed something again.
