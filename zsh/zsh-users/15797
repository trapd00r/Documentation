You could use something like this:

# usage: bindtc <cap> <default> <string>
bindtc () 
{
        local keyval=${termcap[$1]:-$2}
        [[ -n $keyval ]] bindkey -s $keyval $3
}

I use something similar to bind commands to things like pgup and pgdn, whose
escape sequences vary across terminals.  With it, you can run:

bindtc k7 "^[[18~" 'ls -l'

which will use the termcap entry for F7, or if it's missing, will fall back
to "^[[18~".
