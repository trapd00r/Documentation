I removed the interact test and played around with fc and don't see
any difference.
The current regression tests which all work fine.

So here's a suggestion that I believe will have little impact on zsh developers.

Attached should be a two-line patch to #ifdef this code out. Apply it.
If people find problems in fc as a result of this change, I'll fix
these. If we get to a release and people for whatever reason feel the
that life was better disallowing fc unless in interactive mode, then
it is a matter of deleting two lines and you have the old behavior.

I will also remove the interactive flag on zshdb as another means of
getting test coverage there with a program that uses fc without
interactive mode set.

And to show good faith in fixing whatever bugs come up, attached is a
test in an new "fc" file for the bug I recently discovered which by
the way has nothing to do with whether or not interactive is set.
