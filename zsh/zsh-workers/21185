    Hi Frederik :)

    In fact I've tried to use zpty for building frontends to 'dumb'
programs that doesn't support history or line editing. I tried first
with a simple ftp client, since zftp has some problems for me. The
result is incomplete because I haven't had the time to do it.

    You already can open an arbitrary config file with zsh using
/etc/zshrc and $ZDOTDIR/.zshrc and a bit of magic (like an
environment variable). If you want, you can use '-c' too or '-s' to
read commands from stdin or from a file. Be careful about closing
stdin too soon or end your script when you shouldn't ;))

    If what you want is to run 'zsh --config=configfile', ok, there's
no support for that.

    For the rest I don't understand clearly what do you want. If you
could give me some use cases I can try to tell you ways of achieving
what you need.
