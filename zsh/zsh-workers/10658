Ah, now -there's- an aspect of obscurity that I neglected to explore.
"Behind" like one car is behind another in a train [*], not like your
sister is hiding behind the couch.

[*] Train cars aren't automobiles, but automobiles are cars.

Oliver's suggestion:  Yes.

A new widget:  Yes.  Call it repeat-prev-word or copy-prev-shell-word or
some such.  (The distinction is whether the word boundary is typographical 
or shell-lexical, right?)
