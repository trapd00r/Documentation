} "id -u" works form within bash and zsh.

It would seem that once you've gotten as far as having an interactive
shell, whatever conditions are causing the failure no longer apply.

Try putting a call to id -u in ~/.zshenv (which should get executed
before /etc/profile) so you have a chance to see what it's returning
(or not).  E.g.:

echo calling id ...
id -u
echo done with id

} Odd.

Yes.
