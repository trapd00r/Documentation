Autoconf is broken in this sense, the Cray ld does not bug out if you
try to link with nonexistant libraries, and autoconf thinks it has to
include them. I will send a patch for this some day.

I think I tried to build pre1 on a J90 (which basically is a YMP in
CMOS) with Unicos 9, but I'm not sure. What version are you using?

One other problem I have is that it fails to change the terminal
settings (with stty) - it looks like they get reset back when stty
exits (and no I don't have that option on). I think it might have to
do something to do with the way it opens the terminal, but Im not
sure. Bash works all right.

While on the subject of supercomputers; it seem to work on a 
Fujitsu VX :-)
