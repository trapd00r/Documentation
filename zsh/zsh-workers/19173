You need to set the option NO_PROMPT_CR.  This is explained in the FAQ:
zsh usually prints a carriage return before the prompt, so that it knows
where the screen line wraps.  Long lines can't be edited properly
otherwise and right prompts don't display in the same place.  If you're
not worried about either of those, you can safely

setopt nopromptcr
