I've got this in my .zshrc:

    man() {
        screen -h 0 -t "man $@" man $@
    }

This works fine as long as I only supply the function with one argument,
such as "man access", but when I do "man 5 access", it interprets
"5 access" as one argument (even though that is not what I meant ;-).

I have read through the zshexpn man page, and tried quite a few
variations on this, but can't seem to figure it out. Can anyone help me
out?
