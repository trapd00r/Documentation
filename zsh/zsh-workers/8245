} It needs only 8205 and 8216, as far as I can see.

I finally found that it failed because of a set of braces around the body
of an "if" that appear in one hunk in 8219.  You said "not everyone should
use [8219]" so I wanted to do a build/install without it before applying it.

I inserted those braces and then the .rej applied cleanly.

Later, after installing, I deleted the hunk that included the braces from
8219, and was then also able to apply 8219 successfully.
