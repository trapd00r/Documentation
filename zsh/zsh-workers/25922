There's a history of 64-bit Sparc failures with this (and, in the dim
distant past, other) tests: search for fooGRUD at
http://www.zsh.org/mla/ .  This was already failing in 4.3.5.  This is a
bit too bizarre to make any obvious progress without debugging it
directly.  My guess would be something screwy in memory management.
