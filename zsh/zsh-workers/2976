:Yuck.  issetflag() evaluates Y twice, and there aren't enough parentheses.

Really, give me an non-extremely convoluted example where my macros would fail.

:But why bother with these macros anyway?  We've always been happy with
:the (much clearer) plain bit operations anyway.

Fine.  Zoltan's removed them anyway with his replacement patch.

BTW, termok-patch.gz gunzips to a file ``f'', unless you turn original
names off.
Also, the line 

oxtabs = (SGTTYFLAG & SGTABTYPE);

needs to be changed to

oxtabs = ((SGTTYFLAG & SGTABTYPE) == SGTABTYPE);

There is absolutely no guarantee that SGTABTYPE contains unique bits.  On
my machine it's  0xc00
