I followed the instructions as per the subscription confirmation email, but I
keep getting a "failure notice" (attached).  What does it mean, and how do I
unsubscribe?

Hi. This is the qmail-send program at sunsite.dk.
I'm afraid I wasn't able to deliver your message to the following addresses.
This is a permanent error; I've given up. Sorry it didn't work out.

<zsh-users-unsubscribe@sunsite.auc.dk>:
ezmlm-manage: fatal: I don't accept messages at this address (inlocal and/or inhost don't match) (#5.1.1)
