Specifically you need development RPMs. I do not know what do you mean
under "Linux 7.2" but both Mandrake and RedHat do have separate runtime
and development RPMs (and AFAIK SuSE as well; any distro else that had
7.2 version?)

Check for package named like ncurses-devel or libncurses-devel or
libncurses*-devel (Mandrake switched to versioned libraries at some
point so it may be libncurse5-devel e.g.). Likewise for termcap.
