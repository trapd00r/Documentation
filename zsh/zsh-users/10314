This reminds me I was going to post a general solution along the same
lines which deals with embeded spaces etc.:

% array=(one 'two three' '"four five six"')
% typeset -A hash
% array=(${(q)array})
% hash[key]="${array}"
% array=(${(Q)${(z)hash[key]}})
% print -r $array
one
two three
"four five six"

I couldn't work out how to do the encoding in a single step,
since "${(q)array}" and all the variants of it I could think of quote
the spaces that are to be used as separators.
