I am stuck with the following seemingly trivial problem:

Let us define the following function:

test () { echo \"$*\" }

Now, if I do ``test blabla'', I get "blabla", which is what I want.
But if I say e.g. ``test *.aux'', I would like to see "*.aux" printed out,
but instead I get the message: zsh: no matches found: *.aux.

So the problem is that I have to somehow prevent zsh from trying to expand
the result of $* any further. I have tried all kinds of means to achieve
this, but to no avail. (By the way, the above syntax works just fine in
bash, so I am beginning to wonder whether this is a bug in zsh...)

Any help would be highly appreciated...
