I think the bug is in the error message:  at the point it's actually
testing I don't see any reason why there shouldn't be the end of the
string.  Maybe the patch below is what was intended.

By the way, you actually just need:

args "${(ps:\C-@:)$(print -N *)}"

since the single quotes are taken as literal characters inside the double
quotes.  It seems to work without single quotes with the double quotes just
around the command substitution, too.  I suspect trying to quote the
separation string is going to be problematic, because it isn't untokenized
properly.  But until you can find something that doesn't work that
should...
