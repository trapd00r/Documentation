Hello,

mutt's section in email_addresses is incomplete. 

It checks for ~/.muttrc, but not for ~/.mutt/muttrc which is also
acceptable in mutt's case. 

A IMHO better solution:

But that does not help that much, since in order to keep one's muttrc
publicly readable and aliases private, aliases are often keept in a
different file. Normally one uses: 

source my_own_alias_file

You can't know that without searching since one can use several
'source', but it's safe to bet on the value of alias_file, retrivable
with 

`mutt -Q alias_file` 

(This retrieves the file to which mutt is supposed to save new aliases
into - default value '~/.muttrc' ;-)) 

It's very likely that the alias_file is the same file loaded with all
the aliases, though it's not necessarily the case (not in mine at
least), still it should be a better call than ~/.muttrc or
~/.mutt/muttrc. 

Francisco
