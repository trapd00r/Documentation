    Hi all :)

    I'm not sure if this is a bug or if I'm doing anything wrong, but
I can reproduce it even without reading RC's (neither /etc/zshenv
nor /etc/zshrc exist, and I run zsh with "-f").

    $ print $ZSH_VERSION
    4.2.5
    $ touch a b c filename1 filename2 d e
    $ zmodload zsh/complist
    $ COLUMNS=3
    $ ls <TAB><TAB><TAB><TAB><UP><DOWN>
 
    The screen messes up and, depending on the filenames, zsh
sometimes segfaults or hangs. I don't have at hand any zsh compiled
with debug support, but if anyone can reproduce this behaviour I'll
build one and try to post here a backtrace. Anyway, the most common
behaviour is to hang, so the backtrace won't help.

    The problem happens whenever any item in the completion list is
longer or equal to $COLUMNS.

    If more information is needed or whatever, feel free to tell me.

    Thanks a lot in advance :)
