Hi everyone,

zsh displays the home directories of users in a shortened form (in a suitable 
prompt), but only after zsh "knows" about them, for instance after actually 
using the directory name in the shortened form or after doing a completion 
like this:
% cd ~<TAB>

What would be the best way to let zsh figure this out already when it starts?
Thanks,

Christian Taylor
