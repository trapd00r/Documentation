POSIX 1003.2 and X Open Single Unix Spcification Version 2.  It says:

     (7)  A range expression represents the set of collating elements that
          fall between two elements in the current collation sequence,
          inclusively.  It shall be expressed as the starting point and
          the ending point separated by a hyphen (-).

          Range expressions shall not be used in Strictly Conforming
          POSIX.2 Applications because their behavior is dependent on the
          collating sequence.  Range expressions shall be supported by
          conforming implementations.
