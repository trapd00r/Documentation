It works at present so that you get the EOF behaviour if the widget
failed, which means returned non zero status for a builtin widget.

But if the current behaviour is good enough to make sure the shell exits
when the tty goes away (because the read should fail) then it's an
unnecessary complication.  Maybe the documentation could be reworded, since
the `exit after ten EOFs' is not now the behaviour most users will see.
