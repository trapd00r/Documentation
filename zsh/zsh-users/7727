Hi,

Why does zftp appear to be bit of a dark horse?

In Cygwin it doesn't seem to be installed by default (although files are there). I Googled for
tutorials or example scripts and got very few hits.

Is it a relatively new feature? I've been looking for a really flexible FTP client for ages, can't
tell if zftp would fit the bill

Comment?
