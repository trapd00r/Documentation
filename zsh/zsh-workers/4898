That's a general feature.

% testal() { al='print alias'; al; }
% testal
zsh: command not found: al

The entire function is parsed before the alias is defined, so the `al'
never gets expanded.  A script is parsed line by line, so this doesn't
happen.

I don't think there is another way of making functions have local
scope at the moment.
