First, the lack of a space in a BR directive messes up `man zshoptions'.

Second, I should have noticed this before, but ...

`man zsh | helpfiles' doesn't do anything useful, so the comment should
probably be changed.

`man zshall | helpfiles' generates the following spurious output files:

    A             Default       Some          These         zshzle

`man zshbuilins | ...' works better, but produces a very unhelpfile file
for `compctl' (not that zshall gives that much better a one).
