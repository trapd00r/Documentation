Agreed fully!

Agreed fully!

Maybe it's just a question of people knowing your schedule. With each
test/release you could repost the schedule of (class of) problems
you're tackling, like you did some time ago, with the explanation of
why you passed from one class of problems to the other. This way
people will see the position of subst.c, where the biggest part of
Zoltan's changes are.

On the other hand Zoltan did what seems a very good job and fixed many
*longstanding* bugs. This means that his patches are something
important, that deserve specific consideration. Maybe people feel that
you don't consider them important enough to influence your schedule? I
do understand what you mean by "do things serially and
systematically", but it may not be so clear to others...
