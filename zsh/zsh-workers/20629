I believe that it is the binary name of the software described at
http://bazaar.canonical.com/ .  I've never used it.

larch was the original implementation of Arch, thusly named because
there's already an 'arch' binary present on most systems.  It was a
shell script and some C programs reimplementing FTP and whatnot.  I've
never used it.

It looks as though baz is diverging from tla in terms of UI as well as
archive format.  ArX ( http://www.nongnu.org/arx/ ), which I have also
never used, is a fork of tla that I believe is completely incompatible
by this point.  I believe that there have been other Arch forks and
reimplementations, but I can't think of any of their names.

Canonical guys should feel free to correct me on any of this.
