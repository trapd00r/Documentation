Hmm.  Maybe something else in my config is bad.  (I don't use precomp 
emacs binaries because I'm working on it and usually have it built for 
debug etc. -- but when I noticed this I went back to a stock 21.1 build. 
 I could try the prebuilt emacs bins, but I've never noticed any 
difference before.

Yeah, you're probably right.  Thanks for trying to reproduce it.
