When using sudo it seems the $words array is not that useful in the  
following context:

   zstyle -e ':completion:*:processes' command 'if [[ $words[1] ==  
sudo ]] reply="ps auxw"'

If I run

   % sudo kill <TAB>

$words[1] contains "kill", not "sudo".

Is there another way to find out whether a command is run with sudo?  
What I want is make the processes completion return all processes.


Sebastian
