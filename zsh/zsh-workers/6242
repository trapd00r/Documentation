We could change the new ones I added to all start with hist, if we
wanted to.  For instance, `hist_sharing' instead of `shared_history'.

And how about `hist_append_each' for the `incremental_append_history'
option?  Alternately, I still think it would be OK for us to just
lose the incremental append option and have it be the new way that
`append_history' works.
