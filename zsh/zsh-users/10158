I just downloaded and built "zsh 4.3.2", (i686-pc-cygwin). 

It seems that at times when I hit the <CR> key, it will display the
message "You have new mail.".  

My MAIL and MAILDIR environment variables are set to my MH mail folder.

I doubt that zsh knows whether I have mail or not, since it comes in through an external proxy.  

Is there anyway I can turn this off, or set it so that it is correct...

Regards,
