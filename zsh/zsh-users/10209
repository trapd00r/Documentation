Subject: compinstall and command to add to the .zshrc

After running compinstall, I get:

Enter file to save in (~ will be expanded), or return to abort:
file> .zcomp
If you want this file to be run automatically, you should add
  . .zcomp
to your .zshrc.  compinstall will remember the name of this file for
future use.

But the zshbuiltins(1) man page says that the shell looks in the
components of $path to find the directory containing the file.
So, I don't see how this can work, unless ~ is in $path, and it
usually isn't. Shouldn't compinstall have said ". ~/.zcomp"?
