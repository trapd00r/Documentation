[ I forgot to Cc the reply to the list.  Also, I've noticed that a few
  people are still using the address zsh-list@sterling.com.  Rick is
  currently forwarding these, but it is better to use the new address
  which is zsh-workers@math.gatech.edu.  Check the FAQ for the addresses
  of all the zsh lists. ]

I've fixed the above problem (as well as others) in the baseline source.
Beta10 should be out by the end of the week (and maybe even by Wednesday).
