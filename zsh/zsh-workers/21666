Nice.

Presumably this works perfectly well in non-unicode locales if the
resultant character is available. Given that, is insert-unicode-char (as
opposed to something like compose-char) the best name?

I'm sure you know this but for the benefit of anyone that doesn't, it's
possible to configure a compose key with xmodmap. It think the
applicable line (for the rightmost Windows key) is:
  keycode 117 = Multi_key
