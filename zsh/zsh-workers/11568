I think I'm up to date, I know there was a complist patch this morning...

I have a completion list with 4 columns by 10 rows... that's probably not
important, what probably is, is that there is a gap at the bottom right,
i.e. there are 39 entries.  With menu selection, various weird movements
seem to happen:

- going up from the top of column four (the last) goes to the bottom of
  column two, not three;

- going left from the bottom of column one goes to the previous line but in
  column three, not column four.

- going down from the end of column four (the second last line, with
  nothing underneath) goes to the last entry in column three.  It's hard
  to say whether it should go to the top of column four or column one, but
  I don't think the current behaviour is right.  I suppose it should mirror
  the behaviour of moving up from the top of column one and move to the top
  of column four, given that the current implementation never does both
  a vertical and horizontal wrap in the same move.

I don't know if anything else is relevant, but just in case here is the
entire list (I typed `Get', as you can guess).  I confirmed the behaviour
by touching files of the same name in an empty directory.
