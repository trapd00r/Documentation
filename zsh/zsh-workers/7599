Why? Since a first non-option argument is the `a', I think the
`*::...' should take affect the `-e...' after the `a'.

I want to stop completion by _arguments until first non-option
argument --- the `a'. So In the example, I want the behaviour that
there should be no completion after the `a'.

I think this is another issue.

Even if the empty string is a valid option-argument, getopt does not
take the option-argument from the same word because getopt never
knows it. In general, it is impossible to parse command line with the
rule that enable the empty string option-argument just after (without
white space) the option-argument word. So I think it is useless.
