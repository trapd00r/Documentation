It doesn't handle exits, exits are immediate.  That's why it doesn't
mention it.

They are ignored (except exit).  Statuses generally use the value from
the try block.

But it exactly indicates whether or not there's an error.  $? indicates
the status.

$? is like the other variables, it's restored after the always block
to what it was in the try block.  (Internally, the exectry returns the
try block status or'd with the error flag --- I think that's redundant
but it seemed safer --- which gets stored in lastval.)
