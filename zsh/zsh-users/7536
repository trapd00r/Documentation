Ah, no good.  This shows my public IP address (the official internet IP
given to me by my ISP when I am dialed up).

[My apologies for being too vague.  I hope I haven't wasted anyone's time]

I'm actually on two private LANs (one home and one work)... home uses
10.x.x.x and work uses 192.168.x.x but they are both given out via DHCP.


Right now the ugly hack I have is this:

    ifconfig en1 | fgrep 'inet ' | awk '{print $2}'

which works for the Mac, but it would have to be

    ifconfig eth0 | fgrep 'inet ' | awk '{print $2}' |\
    sed 's/addr://'

on Fedora, and possibly even something ELSE for FreeBSD.  Obviously less
than ideal to have to keep hacking several different ways of doing this, but
if that's the only way...

Ah yes, sorry about that.  I saved about $340USD by waiting for Office:2004
to hit the Microsoft employee store, so I've been using the demo version
while waiting.  I should have an official copy soon (aside: I've never liked
Word or Office but Office:Mac 2004 is quite nice).

[no, I'm not an MS employee, but a friend of mine is]

Anyway, I'm running zsh on Fedora, FreeBSD, and Mac OSX. (I actually just
got my old Dell 7500 setup to dual boot XP/Fedora/FreeBSD today, which is
what prompted the question.  I'm all of a sudden going to need/want to know
several bits of information which I haven't needed to know before.

The real challenge is going to be to see if I can write one .zshrc which I
can use on all my difference zsh shell accounts by use of conditional
statements.

Cool, will check it out.

Thanks
