zsh --version gives

3.1.9-dev-6

It also happends independently of the terminal (console, rxvt, xterm),
so the problem's not there too.

No... Here's a quick test that also fails:

function tests {
  test_desc="asdasd
asdasdas
asdasd"
  reply=(`ls`);
}
compctl -K tests -y '$test_desc' testa

When I try to complete 'testa' I get the same behavior.
