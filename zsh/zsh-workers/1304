why are these different, i.e., why does the `rm *' job not tell me
when it's completed, but the `sleep 10' job does?

  $ echo $ZSH_VERSION
  2.6-beta19

  $ rm *
  zsh: sure you want to delete all the files in /scratch/mdb/wrk? y
  ^Z
  zsh: 19348 suspended  rm *
  $ bg
  [1]  + continued  rm *
  $ # notification of job completion never occurs
  
  $ sleep 10
  ^Z
  zsh: 19404 suspended  sleep 10
  $ bg
  [1]  + continued  sleep 10
  $
  [1]  + 19404 done       sleep 10

  
  $ which sleep
  /usr/bin/sleep
  $ which rm
  /home/mdb/gnu/bin/sunos-5.5/rm
