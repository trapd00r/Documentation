This seems reasonable.  Question to everyone (and -workers in
particular): should we add a `urls' style, comparable to `hosts' and
such, that just gives a bunch of strings to complete as urls?
Probably taking precedence over the other things (different from
`hosts' and friends).

Hm, I had hoped there were some `--help' option saying something about 
kerberos.

Then we'd like to know about the other special options and which other 
commands are affected (rsh? rcp?).  With that we could integrate it
into _rlogin (does any of the -workers have a kerberos-rlogin?).
