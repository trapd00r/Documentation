My initial patch broke completing cd into a symbolic link pointing to
the directory (if sorting with follow was turned on).  That is because
for cd completion final flags are (-/) and with sorting set to "date
follow" flags were becoming "(-om-/)" thus 2nd dash was turning
following links off.

Correction below: make sort-files follow option restore the
follow-links qualifier to initial state:
