Hi all,
is a few weeks with satisfaction that use zsh, but have not yet
managed to set some things. The AutoComplete of pkill does not work,
does not show <TAB> with the name of processes but that the files in
the directory is located here.

I tried with zstyle but we are not successful ..

Thank's
