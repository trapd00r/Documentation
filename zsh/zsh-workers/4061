OK.  I've done my best to live with this for six weeks.  But it just isn't
working for me.   This was a really major feature for anyone who had it
turned on, and having read the code now, IMHO the hit far outweighed the
benefits of a fractionally less broken architecture:  it was doing no real
harm until it was the last of the residual state variables.

So I really must protest.  This is purism over usability!

Thus unfortunately, I'm going to have to switch back to 3.0.5 until
the brave new dawn.
