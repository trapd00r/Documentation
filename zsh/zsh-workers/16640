This is fairly common practice and doesn't alarm me by itself.  What

notice.

What worries me about these two is that it sounds like they're setting up
to be able to pull the plug on the whole service without having to stay
on-line after the decision is made.  If there's any reason to move the
repository elsewhere, that would be it.

These don't bother me, but only because I haven't and wouldn't trust them
with any information I considered private in the first place.

zsh.org is sort of a distributed entity right now, isn't it?

The only reason to move the mailing lists would be because of the problems
with zsh-announce and general inattention by the sunsite.dk sysadmins that
Geoff mentioned.

One thing I'd like to do is preserve the contents of the patch manager,

SourceForge released their own site software a bit ago, didn't they?  Does
anyone know of any SourceForge clones?  (Not that we'd necessarily want to
move to such a site over any other host, but I'm curious.)

If we move we should of course turn off all write access to the CVS on
SourceForge.  It wouldn't do to have two active repositories.

Do we have shell access to the actual filesystem of the zsh CVS trees?
(I haven't looked since they rearranged all the servers some months ago.)
If so it wouldn't be difficult to set up a periodic rsync.
