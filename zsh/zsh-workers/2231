I'm getting a `test is always zero' message from getlzlequery() in
zle_utils.c due to testing whether a char is EOF.  This is something
to do with:

        * Src/utils.c: getquery always returned n on cray-unicos. From
          Richard D. Slater (2136)

Either the test shouldn't be there, or the variable c should be an
int, or the variable should be a signed char and we need to check
whether the compiler supports it (and we presumably lose the ability
to recognise character 255, so that's probably wrong).  I don't know
which avoids reintroducing the UNICOS problem.
