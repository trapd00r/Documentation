What's wrong with:

	alias glob='print -N'

I usually use `typeset +x' rather than `unset' for unsetenv because in
{t}csh the environment and non-environment settings are independent;
you can have `set FOO=bar' and `setenv FOO blat', and if in that case
you do `unsetenv FOO; echo $FOO' you will still get "bar".  On the
argument that `unsetenv FOO' shouldn't do anything surprising if FOO
was never exported in the first place, `unset FOO' is bad.

I suppose you could do

	for var
	do
		export | grep \^$var\= >& /dev/null && unset $var
	done 

but that seems overkill.
