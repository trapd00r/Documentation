Hi,

Does anyone have a completion for the finger command? I need 

finger username@hostname
"username" is the system list of users 
"hostname" is my predefined list of various hosts

I also need to be able to execute the command with just
finger username

Any help will be appreciated alot. I spent some time on the man pages and
although I learnt alot of things this continues to elude me.

Thanks
sameer
