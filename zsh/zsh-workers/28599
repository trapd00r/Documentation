I could be convinced the latter is correct.  Apart from KSH_TYPESET,
nothing stands out in my mind as needing special behaviour during the
expansion phase.  A careful search of the manual might be warranted.

There was some discussion of the KSH_TYPESET behaviour on the Austin
group list; I can't remember the exact upshot, but it's possible it
makes the proposed change a requirement.
