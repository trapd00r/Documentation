1. Yes, you need the backslash there.
2. You didn't tell it that it can insert characters at the end (`r:|=*').
3. Look at your character class.  Closely.

     [.,_-\ ]

   That's `a dot, a comma or one of the characters between an underscore
   and a space'.  Since the space is ASCII-wise before the underscore
   that's the same as `a dot or a comma'.

   You might want to try 'r:|[.,\ _-]=** r:|=*'.


Bye
  Sven
