I can reproduce it.  Type

/usr<left to u><tab><control-e>

This is actually a more general problem, because it doesn't have to be a
slash character which gets deleted.  It'll be whatever would be deleted
with a backspace.

I saw this quite some time ago, but was too busy to submit a full
trouble report.  I'm running 3.1.1; I've seen it with 3.1.2 and 3.0.5.
(No, I can't remember why I backed out of 3.1.2, yes, I do feel it's
time to upgrade.)
