dict takes a number of options, so some of them will probably find their
way into the _arguments call.

dict doesn't require any data to exist on the client machine; I content
myself to use dict.org, rather than running a server.  For the
distribution, I'd rather see dict used itself to get the available
words, say, by parsing `dict -m -s re '.*'` or perhaps something
more efficient.  Of course, I just tried this, and was greeted with
dict (xmalloc): Out of memory while allocating 4072 bytes

Figures.
