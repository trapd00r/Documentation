} According to POSIX, I think, the following should work.

Bash2 chokes on it as well:

bash2: command substitution: line 2: syntax error near unexpected token `abc'
bash2: command substitution: line 2: ` abc'

The following works in both shells, and is the reason that the fully-
parenthesized case conditions were introduced, IIRC.

    echo $(case $TEST in
     (abc)
      echo a   
      ;;            
     (def)
      echo b   
      ;;   
    esac)
