Assignable positional parameters are an intentional feature.  There's no
way they can cause a problem, because a POSIX conforming shell script must
not even attempt it.  (Even in POSIX the positional parameters can be
replaced with the `set' builtin, so claiming that they should be read-only
does not hold water.)

I don't have an immediate answer to that, although having looked briefly
at the bash2 web site the other day and it's possible that it now has even
more of its "builtins" as loadable modules than zsh does.
