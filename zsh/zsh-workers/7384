} The patch below tries to do that in the simplest way I could think of.

Hrm.  One problem which may not even be worth mentioning is that

	${(Qq)param}	acts like ${(q)param} and
	${(qQ)param}	acts like ${(Q)param}

whereas other "inversions" like using (j///s///) always both happen and
always happen in the same order regardless of the order in which the flags
appear.
