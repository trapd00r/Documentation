} Hmm, it wouldn't be something to do with the fact that the length of the
} output, even excluding %{...%}'s, varies with the status of the previous
} command, by any chance?

(Sound of hand smacking forehead)

The prompt system internally knows that %U/%u %S/%s %B/%b don't take up any
space, but they don't disappear from ${(%%)...} expansions.  There's a
conditional on exit status that includes a %S/%s pair.

Now I just have to figure out what to do about it ...
