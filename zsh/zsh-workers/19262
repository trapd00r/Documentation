Well, doing that would fix the compile problem that has been mentioned
for FreeBSD and that I have on my Debian machine. Not the nicest way
but it'd work just as long as no system uses something other than -1
for ERR.

The rest of this looks like the 4.1 patch for echoti to take arguments.
It lacks the changes I made in 18626 in response to the thread starting
at 18544. I take it from the subject line that you're suggesting this
is applied to 4.0. I really don't think we should be making changes
like this on the 4.0 branch. Especially not this shortly before a 4.0.8
release. terminfo/termcap are one of the more common causes of
portability problems and 4.0 is at least working at the moment.
