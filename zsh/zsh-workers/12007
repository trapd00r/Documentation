Since I just subscribed to zsh-workers, I had to look at the archive:
 First of all a BIG sorry for the huge attachment!
 If I had realized how big it is I would have gzipped it.

And then: Sven is right.  I found a copy of _mailboxes in ~/.zsh/functions 
I completely forgot about that.  The reason then was to change

 local i j expl muttrc="${muttrc:-~/.muttrc}"
to
 local i j expl muttrc="${muttrc:-~/.muttrc:~/.mutt/local}"

because my "mailboxes" command is in .mutt/local.  That doesn't semm to be
a problem anymore.

Anyway, "mutt -f" completion now works!!!  Thanks a lot!
Just one thing: I noticed that "Mailboxes" and "mailboxes" is offered as
completion now, too.  Where does that come from?  It's listed under
"mailbox specification".  And
 % mutt -f \= <TAB>
 mailbox specification
 \=alert             \=brnet      \=junk.spiegl    \=postmaster    \=tripwire     \=wwwcron  
 \=ard-webtechnik    \=bugtraq    \=orakel         \=root          \=weberror                
 \=backupmaster      \=junk       \=out            \=sub           \=webmaster               

althought I have quite a few other "mailboxes" defined, too.  Hm...?

Thanx so much,
 Andy.

PS: I am really looking forward to upcoming surgeries...  :-)
