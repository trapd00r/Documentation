So i conclude from your response that nobody is working on it ;). 
I understand the time problem, everybody is short on time, including
myself. The thing is that i have zero knowledge about zsh source,
and this seems a good time to start some source reading ;). I don't
want to go back to the readline hell ;) to have full utf-8 support.

But i need help to know where to start. What parts of zsh would need 
to be worked on, only zle? Is there already, some kind of, although
minimal, support for utf-8? Also, if you know from some documentation
about zsh internals, besides from source ;), please point me to it.

Thanks,
