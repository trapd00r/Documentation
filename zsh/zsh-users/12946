Just in case: you've probably seen Thomasz Pala's solution, setting
LC_CTYPE=de_DE.ISO8859-15. This worked for me, but if there's a more
"intuitive" solution, I'm all for it. After all this is a quiet
change--what worked before has stopped working and needs to be
re-enabled by some non-obvious magic spell :-)
