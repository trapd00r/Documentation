[later corrected "read" to "vared"].

Here the thing though. The debugger sometimes *does* read from a file
(the debugger "source"
command).

So in light of a program that does both - sometimes read from a file
and sometimes from a terminal,
any suggestions?

clone seems intriguing, although right now I'm not sure what other
problems I'll get into.
A simple test with another tty gave:
   could not make /dev/pts/1 my controlling tty, job control disabled

Still for the case I was originally concerned with -- a
non-interactive script that becomes interactive -- it might work
better. Since the debugger wants to keep around a list of the input
and output file descriptors in use, would it make sense to use both
the exec <> and the clone? Or is there a way to capture the file
descriptor after the clone is done?

(So happens in the real code I *do* want shell escapes expanded ;-)
