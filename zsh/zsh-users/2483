} '[PIPE MESSAGE Result: zsh: command not found: ^C]'

That message would make me guess that zsh is finding in $PATH a binary for
some other architecture and is attempting to execute it as a shell script.
(I'm not sure why 3.0.6 wouldn't give the same message.)

Given that local/bin/zsh "determines the system I am on" and that it works,
probably some environment setting is either wrong or missing when you don't
use the wrapper script.
