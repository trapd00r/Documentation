Yes, this is the result of my last typeset patch.  As a side effect of
getting `typeset -p' to print `-i 2' where appropriate, the normal
typeset code prints `integer 2' if you the parameter has a base.  I
didn't see this as a problem since the output was never standardised and
anyone parsing it is presumably looking for particular words (I could
have made an exception but there are enough around already).  I should
have checked the test suite, though.
