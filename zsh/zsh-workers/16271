Subject: Zsh 4.0.4 and Emacs 21.1 in Windows XP
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii; format=flowed

I'm trying to use Zsh 4.0.4 on Windows XP with Emacs 21.1 in shell-mode. 
 I compiled both of them from sources.

Everything works OK except zsh thinks all my input has an extra CR (^M) 
at the end of each line.  So in order to do a 'ls' I have to do 'ls;' 
and then it does the ls properly and then gives me an error 'zsh: 
command not found: ^M'.  If I just type ls<CR> I get 'zsh: command not 
found: ls^M'.  I've turned off all my .z* scripts and it didn't make any 
difference.  All that's set in my .emacs is
  (setq shell-file-name "c:/bin/zsh.exe")
  (setq explicit-shell-file-name shell-file-name)

Has anyone tried this?  Is it supposed to work?

(By the way, zsh works fine in a regular command window.)

Thanks,
