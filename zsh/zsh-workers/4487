Take a look at this:

zagzig<106> bindkey | grep back
"^B" backward-char
"^H" backward-delete-char
"^W" "^W" "^W" "^W" "^W" "^W" "^W" "^W" backward-kill-word
"^X^P" history-beginning-search-backward
"^Xr" history-incremental-search-backward
(etc.)

It didn't look like that when I started up; a fresh zsh shows:

zagzig<3> bindkey | grep back
"^B" backward-char
"^H" backward-delete-char
"^W" backward-kill-word
"^X^P" history-beginning-search-backward
"^Xr" history-incremental-search-backward
(etc.)

Looks like "zed" tickles the bug:

zagzig<4> zed -f zed
(output omitted, typed ctrl-J)
zagzig<5> bindkey | grep back
"^B" backward-char
"^H" backward-delete-char
"^W" "^W" backward-kill-word
"^X^P" history-beginning-search-backward
"^Xr" history-incremental-search-backward
(etc.)

Every time I run "zed" I get another "^W" stuck on the front of that
binding.  They're being taken as part of the widget name:

zagzig<6> alskdjfa<C-W>
No such widget `"^W" backward-kill-word'
