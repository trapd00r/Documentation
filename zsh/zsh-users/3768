If you volunteer to make clean configure check for it ... Do not forget -
CVS is for developers. It assumes, that you have complete environment -
and in case of Zsh it includes yodl. I do not see any need to complicate
things any further. Better is to port yodl to Cygwin (if any port is
needed).

I mean, I first build zsh on Unix, that creates man/info and then build on
Cygwin.
