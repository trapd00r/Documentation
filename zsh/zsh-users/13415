Peter, All,

Peter Stephenson <p DOT w DOT stephenson AT ntlworld DOT com>:
] Vincent spotted a completion problem with completion of abbreviated
] directory hierarchies like /u/lo/li. I think I've found the fix and
] if so I'll make 4.3.9 tomorrow.

I'm now in my 19th year of using Zsh, and this is one very cool feature
that I was completely unaware of. I'm sure there are a ton more. Where
can I go to find an overview of such cool features?

Regards,
Eric
