Actually, it seems that the pages have found a new home, at  
http://www.peak.org/zsh/

The folks @ peak.org have donated the web space and I am currently  
working on changing the pages over to the peak site.

Final details are not yet available, and the pages are not done  
yet, but never fear, it will be taken care of in a day or two...  
maybe three, I haven't really looked at the HTML code all that much  
yet...

I will be able to maintain the pages for at least the next year,  
and hopefully longer...
