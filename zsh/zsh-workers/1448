} The (:...) modifiers stopped working only if the argument had no wildcards
} so *(:r) always worked.  And foo.bar(:r) works only since about a year.

Ah.

zagzig<1> i=foo.bar
zagzig<2> echo $i:r $i(:r)
foo foo.bar

Hmm.

zagzig<3> echo ${i(:r)}
zsh: closing brace expected

Oh, well.

} That particular bug is related to the execcmd reorganization

Right, I was using metafication for example only.

} to allow
} things like foo=exec ; $foo bar work which is probably more basic than
} the modifiers.

I agree (now) that in this case the problem wasn't serious; I thought
the parameter-substitution modifiers were broken as well.

} In beta21 there was no really serious problems.  I'm going to release
} beta22 within a couple of days.  It will contain a partial solution of the
} signal reentrancy problem by saving and resoring some variables which fixes
} the most serious problems.

Sounds worthwhile.

} If no problems reported within a few days
} of that release I'll announce this beta in some newsgroups as a 3.0
} pre-release.

Has this one, reported a few days ago by someone else, been fixed?

zagzig<9> echo "foo\
> $bar"
foo$bar

That seems like an important thing to get right.

} Maybe beta22 is not a good name for that.  It may be better
} to call it to zsh-2.99.0 as the next stable release will be zsh-3.0.0.

Why not 3.0-prerelease, or something like that?

} I know that there were many changes since beta16, more than I wanted.  RC
} announced a feature freeze a year ago.  New features were introduced in
} beta17 but these new features were already well tested as these were
} present in my non-official releases for more than a year.  Sine beta17
} there were many conceptual changes to fix long-standing bugs and to improve
} sh compatibility.

Yes; let me reiterate that I'm happy with all of this, I was just
wondering about how much longer it was going to continue.

} Also several debug tests were added and these are enabled by default.
} These debug messages might give a feeling that recent betas are more buggy
} than older ones but most of these bugs were always there.

I understand about that.  I based my impression on the number of bug
reports that crossed the list following release of beta20.
