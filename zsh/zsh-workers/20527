You've replaced a couple of open()s which were O_NOCTTY with one that isn't.
Does this affect anything?  Were they erroneously O_NOCTTY or were they
specifically that way for scripts or something else?  You haven't mentioned
either here or in the ChangeLog that this was intentional.

Regards,
Geoff
