Subject: AIX build problem - compiler is cross-compiler
Cc: .@corridor.com

For some reason configure is incorrectly determining that
the AIX native compiler is a cross compiler.

This has never happened before.

I do have gcc installed, however I am setting CC=xlc, which
gets picked up properly.

Suggestions anyone?

Thanks.
