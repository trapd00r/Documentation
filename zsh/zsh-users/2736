If you use

	setopt autocd

then you can leave off the "cd" entirely and just type

	directory

You could also try

	bindkey -s 'cd' '^Vcd '

but then you may find yourself needing to erase an extra space in other
unexpected places, like in the middle of the word "anecdote" (not that
you're ever particularly likely to type "anecdote" in the shell).
