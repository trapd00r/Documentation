"builtin" should be added to the list of precommand modifiers in the
zshmisc man page.  I think Zoltan removed that when he converted
"builtin" from a reserved word, to a shell builtin.  Apparently all
the precommand modifiers other than nocorrect are actually shell
builtins now (they were previously all reserved words).

I remember this, because this was the reason I started rewriting the
hash table code, so that you could disable and re-enable reserved
words.
