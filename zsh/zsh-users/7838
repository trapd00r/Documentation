This should probably be considered a bug.

In addition to Philippe's suggestion of using precmd so that $? is saved
and restored for you by the shell -- which is what should be happening 
during command substitutions in prompt expansion, but isn't -- a simple
alternative is to use $(<...) instead of `cat ...`.

You can also use $'...' instead of `echo '...'`

export PS1='$(</tmp/temperature)'" %m%~ %(0?."\
$'%{\e[1;32m%}:)%{\e[0m%}.%{\e[1;31m%}:(%{\e[0m%}'") %# "
