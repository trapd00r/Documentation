This may be the last message from me for about a week ... and I don't
have a lot of time, so just one comment:

}     - don't use the positional parameters, instead store the words in

I didn't want to do this originally, in part because of ksharrays.  You
have to remember to unsetopt that, or CURRENT won't be the correct index
into the words.  If you use $argv, ksharrays doesn't matter.
