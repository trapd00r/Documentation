OK, in that case I've created a branch called `zsh-4_0-patches' (after a
botched attempt called `zsh-4_0_1-patches', ignore that).  We'll have to
decide patch by patch what is important enough to go on that branch, but
for the time being, at least, everything will go on the main branch in any
case.

For those not familiar with this bit of CVS, to get this branch:
  cvs checkout -r zsh-4_0_patches zsh
will check it out with a `sticky' tag so that commits go back on that
branch.  The main (development) branch will be the default if you don't do
that.  You can also do tricks with `update' which can get rather nasty.
