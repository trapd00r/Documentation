} I am not enabling the printexitvalue or the monitor.  This must be turned
} on by default:

Monitor is on by default for interactive shells, but printexitvalue is
never on by default.

Here's a wild shot in the dark:  How are you starting zsh?

	zsh -l		# Dash-ell, makes zsh a login shell
	zsh -1		# Dash-one, turns on printexitvalue

I could envision someone looking at the FAQ or manual pages in certain
typefaces/fonts and misreading dash-ell as dash-one ...

The only other possibility is that some /etc/zsh* file is setting the
option for you.
