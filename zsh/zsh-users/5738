Yes, I've tried both your suggestions to no avail.  It
doesn't matter where I put the descriptor, it just
won't work.  After some research into terminfo, I
found out that not all terminfo support is created
equal.  Some programs just worked, others (non-curses
programs) required modification of '/etc/termcap'. 
Apparently Zsh is in the latter category.  I added the
termcap entry, and all is well now.

Thanks to all who offered help.
