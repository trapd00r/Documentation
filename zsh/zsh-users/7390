    But I really like Gaelic, I love the sound, the musicality,
etc. This summer, if I can afford the time, I would like to start
learning gaelic, seriously. Is a really beautiful language. Anyway I
love to learn languages, but I don't have the needed time :( I should
learn Català before... Well, this is OT O:)

    I really like the categories that Bart showed. I've saved the
message for future reference ;)
