Well, here's some documentation.  But I'm worried about what happens with
control-space.  Might it not be better to use an array with the literal
codes in (so a null-string means ^@), or alternatively provide a length
parameter, or use some form of metafication?

Can probably be done quite simply with a shell function, which could be
marked #autoload if needed.
