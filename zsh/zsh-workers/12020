Now that the completion system is able to set up all this wonderful context,
I'm wondering about being able to use it elsewhere in zle.

For example, I'd like backward-kill-word to stop at dots when I'm editing
an IP address in an ssh or telnet command, but to delete past dots and stop
at slashes when I'm editing a file name.

It can almost be done with a completion function that figures out how to
modify the word and then calls compadd -U, but that doesn't work for e.g.
transpose-words (or anything else that spans more than one word).
