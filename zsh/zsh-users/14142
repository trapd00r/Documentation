================

edge case. apparently it's the '(e)' in this line from my zshrc that's 
causing the trouble:
 	${(e)PR_STUFF[FILLBAR]}

zshrc - http://smasher.org/zsh/

i'm not sure if this is a priority bug, but i still think that unsetting 
IFS should cause it to return to its default, rather than setting it to 
'\n'.
