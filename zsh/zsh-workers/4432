POSIX does require the historical behaviour of mv.  However, as this
mv can only be used by taking explicit action (loading/autoloading
the module), I consider POSIX conformance to be less of an issue than
it is for the shell itself.  If someone wants to write a patch to add
the copy/remove fallback to the builtin mv, I don't have a problem with
putting it into the baseline; I just don't consider the current behaviour
to be broken.

Ugly.  There are a number of nasty issues here.

zsh is not GPLed, and it's written much more neatly than most GNU
programs anyway.
