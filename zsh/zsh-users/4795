I don't parse out the classpath. Rather I perform the completion function, and
generate the possible package names (and cache them for later use). So I can
complete on a classpath setting (including .zips and .jars) rather than on a
directory basis. Which is what you really want.

Don't know yet if the zsh 4.x completions handle this. Unfortunately my current
client is stuck on 3.x at the moment :-( Hopefully I can check this out next
week.
