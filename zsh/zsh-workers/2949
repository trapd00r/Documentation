As far as I know, the user side of the zle code hasn't changed yet, but
I'm having problems:

bindkey -s "^X^L" "^@"

should make "^X^L" do set-mark-command, but actually it produces a
pound (sterling) sign on my keyboard.  The sequence bound to doesn't
seem to matter.

Is this a statement against European monetary union or a bug?
