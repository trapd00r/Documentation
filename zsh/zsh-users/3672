Subject: Completions under NT / cygwin

At work I have built zsh from the latest CVS sources using the cygwin
toolkit.  When I use the new completion system, I can not complete
fully-qualified filenames, be they of the form "/cygdrive/d/views/..."
or (more conveniently) "d:/views/...".  Is there a magic style setting
I need to use to complete these filenames?

TIA,
  vin shelton
