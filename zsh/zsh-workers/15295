Hello,

I have some problems with zsh 4.0.x on OpenBSD/sparc but not on
OpenBSD/i386.  The problem is simple, the regular expression code
doesn't seem to work on sparc:

sparc:

  zsh% ls *
  zsh: no matches found: *

i386:

  zsh% ls *
  file1  file2  file3

What part of zsh is specifically called when doing * evaluation ? 

Ciao,
  ...David
