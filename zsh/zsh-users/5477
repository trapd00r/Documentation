    through the list? i filter this list into its mailbox on the
    Delivered-To: header, so anything that goes to the list should end
    up in that mailbox, and i don't remember a single spam or virus
    getting in the folder. I don't use anything like SA, nor any AV,
    just a few maildrop rules... Hm, but they route quite a few emails
    to /dev/null, so that might be it: aol, juno, msn, yahoo, to name a
    few.
