I've had other problems, including `\c' not being interpreted by echo,
which is actually deliberate for `emulate sh', and lots of tests failing,
but there's something wrong with setting up here since a lot of tests fail
anyway.  The errors include usage messages from grep and egrep, and errors
from perl, so I don't think I'm going to be going very far as things stand
at the moment.  However, zsh does produce more errors.  I haven't seen
memory problems, though.  Maybe I'll try at home.
