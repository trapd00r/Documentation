Subject: PATCH: Capitalize a parameter containing combined characters

I did some quick tests of parameter expansion with combined characters,
and found a small bug:

zsh$ x=3D=C3=A9fg            # =C3=A9 is a combined character, e + =
U+0301
zsh$ echo ${(C)x}     # capitalize
=C3=89Fg                   # should be "=C3=89fg"

This may be fixed, for example, by the patch below.
