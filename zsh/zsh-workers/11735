Subject: Bug: TRAPEXIT not executed
Message-ID: <20000603152904.A948@eggink3.rrz.uni-hamburg.de>
Mail-Followup-To: Zsh Workers <zsh-workers@sunsite.auc.dk>
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Disposition: inline
User-Agent: Mutt/1.3.2i

When the following script exits, TRAPEXIT doesn't get executed:

    function TRAPEXIT
    {
       print BYE
    }

    function f
    {
       print f
    }

    f

However, if function f is *not* called, TRAPEXIT gets executed. 

Regards,
Bernd
