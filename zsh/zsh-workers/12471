} compdef -P _use_lo '*'

I've been fooling around with a function to be a front-end to _use_lo
that would try to determine whether the command accepts --help and poke
_use_lo into _comps if it does.  Maybe there's some way to combine it
with Adam's completion caching layer so zsh could "learn" which commands
can be completed that way.
