} What might be a good idea is to get sourceforge to mirror ftp and web
} from sunsite Denmark.

To do a SOurceForge file release, you first upload the file to the
download.sourceforge.net/incoming directory, and then submit a web form
via HTTPS to cause it to be moved to the project's releases area.  They
have all sorts of dire warnings about what will happen to you if you use
this mechanism to snatch some other project's files out of the incoming
area, which is shared by all projects.

If there's a way to automate this procedure with cron, I don't know it.
