Yes, that could be considered a bug.  Suggested patch below.

But under what circumstances would you write that?

The only case where I can think offhand of that coming up is something
like this:

  original_cmd="lsof -ag $$ -d 0-2,10-15 >&2"
  # ... time and code passes ...
  modified_cmd="$original_cmd >&-"
  # ... more time and code passes ...
  finished_cmd="$modified_cmd >&2"
  eval $finished_cmd

Here's the patch.  This relies on the fact that mfds[] elements are heap
allocated; it also means that repeatedly opening and closing a descriptor
with MULTIOS on will repeatedly allocate and discard a multio structure,
whereas before it would re-use it even after closing.

Patch line numbers may be off because I've applied 20632 (PWS, I think
you could commit that, it seems to be fine).
