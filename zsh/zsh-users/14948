i'm working on my zshrc <http://smasher.org/zsh/> and i'm trying to 
add/optimize some features that are OS specific... but for now i only have 
access to linux and freeBSD systems.

it would be great if anyone can provide shell access to darwin, solaris, 
*bsd and any other *nix flavor (and linux distributions) with zsh on it. 
old or new... the more surprises i run into, the more robust the outcome 
will be.

thanks...!
