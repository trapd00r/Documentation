Excellent - I can confirm "mkdir /c" does provide a workaround, and "ls
/c/<TAB>" now works.

However, with "setopt nocaseglob", I can no longer complete using "ls
c:/<TAB>" regardless of whether I "mount -c /" or "mount -c /cygdrive".
If I "setopt caseglob", I can then complete using "ls c:/<TAB>". This
again also used to work fine with "setopt nocaseglob" in zsh 4.2.6 (with
earlier cygwin library) on WinXP.

I've tried setting the following but they don't help:
$ zstyle=20
fake-files
        :completion:* /:c /:d /:b /:o /:w /:r /:v
accept-exact
        :completion:*:paths c: d: b: o: w: r: v:


Btw, thanks very much for all the time you've spent looking into this.

That's very strange, since that's got nothing to do with Cygwin and it
does work elsewhere.  But I can see that too, and I can see that
fake-files does produce files that actually aren't there (e.g. if I use
"/:a b c" I get a and b).  However, unfortunately the setting in
question
disappears into the horrors of compfiles.  This looks like a bug that
may or may not be associated with the other problems.

This is likely to be the cause of why this case is different (even if
the shell is doing something a bit weird, too).  If globbing can't see
it compfiles won't.  What's more, with this knowledge I can reproduce
your problem: I had a directory /c that I was using for mount c:
directly and with "cygpath -c /" this was appearing for globbing an the
completion system.  This gives a workaround, at least: "mkdir /c".

I can't see why /c wouldn't appear to globbing, but it doesn't in bash
either so presumably readdir() doesn't return it.  This is a question
for the Cygwin people.  Since, as you say

> If I "mount -c /cygdrive" then "print /*" includes "/cygdrive" (and

drives.

this looks to me like a bug, or at the least a limitation of overlaying
the drives on an existing directory.

I've no idea why this would be different.  None of the changes I can see
in compfiles look like they would make a difference.  It ought to be
possible (even easy, if you know how to do it) to add a special case so
that a statable file is always added as a match.  However, maybe it
should
be doing that anyway.  If anybody understood compfiles they might be
able to answer this.  I hesitate to do this without more thought.

It would help if I could debug this on a native Unix operating system.
