====================

if a command returns non-zero, i see the return status in my prompt. 
sometimes that can be a distraction, and i'd like to "clear" it by hitting 
<return>.

i guess i can add a check for "${options[interactive]}" before resetting 
the return status so i should be able to avoid the case you've pointed 
out... but in the test i ran here it seems to not get have a problem with 
that in a script.

######################
## clear the return status by pressing <return>
accept-line () {
     if [ '0' != "${?}" ] && [ ! "${BUFFER}" ]
     then
         BUFFER=:
     fi
     zle .accept-line
}
zle -N accept-line
######################

this works, but aesthetically i'd prefer if it didn't put a ":" on the 
command line... any ideas...?
