Yes, and that's what the original example above was about -- the
`user' `invented' the tag names `foo' and `bar', linking them to the
`method' `files'. And before that I made the suggestion to allow the
file-patterns style to contain invented tag names.

I had played with the idea to first try it with a function, too ;-)

Yes! It's annoying, isn't it? I was tempted more than one to change
it. Or maybe add an option to make it be quiet... unfortunately `shift -q' 
has always been interpreted as `shift -$q'. Sigh.
