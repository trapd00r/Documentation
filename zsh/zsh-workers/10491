Removed functions are not handled gracefully:

bor@itsrm2% zrecompile
re-compiling /home/bor/.zsh.d/std.zwc: failed (missing files)

This is the result of renaming _try and _loop.

Is it possible to remove function definitions from wordcode file? In
this case, something like "synchronise wordcode file with directories"
comes in mind.
