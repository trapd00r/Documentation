The extended glob used excludes those filenames which match the second
glob.  The first one excludes filenames starting with "f".  The second
excludes those ending ".o".

If a filename ends ".c" then it can not also, at the same time, end
".o".

This says nothing about whether or not there exists a different filename
which has the same basename, but ends ".o" instead of ".c".
