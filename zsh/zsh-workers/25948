I tried to write the patches to offer msdosfs and not msdos as an option
to -t.  Since msdos is still accepted, I wrote the patch to display the
msdosfs options for both when -o is completed.  DragonFlyBSD is
basically the same except for the "fs" suffixes on three of the file
systems offered according to its man pages.

It appears to work correctly for me.  Did I miss something?

Examples:
1. mount -t <Tab> shows msdosfs and not msdos.
2. mount -t (msdos|msdosfs) -o <Tab> show the exact same options.
