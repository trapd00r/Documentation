Yes, there's a few more on the web site. The relevevant URL is:

	http://www.mal.com/zsh/

or more specifically,

	http://www.mal.com/zsh/Contrib/

A couple users sent me some of their examples. I put them up on
the web site, but I'd prefer a link so that users can just maintain
what they want to share (like what Peter Stephenson has allowed me to
do).
