Hm, I tried that before I saw Sven's patch, but it doesn't change anything.
Probably because I am using the new function-based completion.  Is compctl
useless in that case?  Or can the two methods be combined?

I turned it on because I wanted tcsh's behavior.

Thanks again for your fast answer,
 Andy.
