  Just out of curiosity, isn't this a problem that's neatly solved with
a utility like find(1)?  I realize that zsh is more than qualified to
perform this task, but don't we have dedicated binaries to do things for
a reason?  This isn't a rhetorical question; I'm sure there is an
answer, I'm just wondering what it is...=20
