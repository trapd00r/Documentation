                                C Communication

   This appendix provides information on how the VT320 communicates with a
   host computer, printer, or modem. The appendix shows the cables you can
   use for different system configurations. It describes how XON and XOFF
   characters help control data flow. The last section describes the
   signals carried by the connectors on the rear of the terminal.

   The terminal operates on full-duplex asynchronous lines only, with 10
   possible transmit and receive speeds. You can use split transmit and
   receive speeds, but you must use the same speeds as your host system
   and printer.

   To match your host system's speed, use the Communications Set-Up
   screen. To match your printer's speed, use the Printer Set-Up screen.
   See Chapter 4.

   For more information on communication, see the VT320 Programmer
   Reference Manual.

Cables

   You can connect the VT320 directly to a local host system with a cable.
   You can also connect the terminal indirectly to a remote host system,
   using (1) a terminal server, or (2) a modem or acoustic coupler
   connected to public-switched or dedicated telephone lines. See "Modems"
   in Chapter 6.

   You can connect the VT320 to a local, asynchronous, serial printer by
   using a null modem cable.

   Figure C-1 shows the DEC-423 and RS232 cables you can use to connect
   the VT320 to a host system or printer. To order cables, see Appendix B.

XON/XOFF Flow Control

   The VT320 stores incoming characters in a character input buffer. The
   buffer can hold 254 characters. The terminal processes characters from
   the buffer on a first-in/first-out basis.

   When the input buffer fills to 64 or 128 characters, the terminal sends
   an XOFF character to stop the host system from sending more characters.
   The default setting is 64. You can select from three settings -- 64,
   128, or no XOFF -- using the Communications Set-Up screen.

   NOTE: If you select "No XOFF" in set-up, the terminal does not send an
   XOFF character to the host system when the input buffer fills.
   Selecting "No XOFF" also disables the Hold Screen key. With XOFF
   disabled, there is no way to ensure that data will not be lost.

   If the host system fails to respond to the XOFF character, the terminal
   sends a second XOFF character when the input buffer fills to 220
   characters. The terminal sends a third XOFF character when the buffer
   is full.

   When the input buffer falls below 32 characters, the terminal sends an
   XON character to tell the host system to start sending characters
   again.

   If you enable XON/XOFF, the terminal recognizes received XON and XOFF
   characters. When the terminal receives XOFF, it stops sending data
   (except XON/XOFF characters). If the keyboard data buffer overflows,
   the keyboard locks and the Wait indicator turns on. The terminal
   resumes transmission when it receives an XON.

Modem Connections and Disconnections

   When the VT320 makes a connection to the host system via a modem, the
   terminal performs the following operations to ensure it is ready to
   send and receive.
     * Unlocks the keyboard (if it was locked).
     * Clears any transmission in progress.
     * Clears the keyboard buffer and all message buffers.
     * Clears the input buffer.
     * Clears XOFF sent and XOFF received.

   Any of the following conditions will disconnect the connection to the
   host system.
     * You type Shift-Break.
     * You use the Recall or Default features in the Set-Up Directory.
     * You change the host port you are using from the RS232 port to the
       DEC423 port, or from the DEC423 port to the RS232 port. See the
       Host Port Selection feature in the Communications Set-Up screen
       (Chapter 4).
     * The terminal loses the data set ready (DSR) signal.
     * The terminal loses the receive line signal detect (RLSD) signal for
       the period of time you selected in set-up. See the Disconnect,
       _____ Delay feature in the Communications Set-Up screen.
     * The terminal receives a self-test command from the host system.

   The usual way to disconnect communications is to type Shift-Break. The
   host system's response to the disconnect signal depends on the system
   and the software.

Break Function

   A break condition is the occurrence of a continuous space on a
   communication line for greater than one character time. If you are
   using a modem, this condition causes the modem to disconnect the
   terminal from the host system.

   The Break key has three functions. You can enable or disable the Break
   key in the Keyboard Set-Up screen.
    1. If enabled, pressing Break sends a break signal to the host. If
       disabled, you can still send a break signal to the host by typing
       Shift-Break.
    2. Pressing Shift-Break disconnects communications when you use a
       modem.
    3. Pressing Ctrl-Break sends the answerback message (Communication
       Set-Up) to the host.

Connector Signals

   The VT320 has two host system (comm) connectors and one printer
   connector on the rear of the terminal. Table C-1 describes the
   interface signals for the 25-pin host system connector. Table C-2
   describes the signals for the 6-pin host connector and 6-pin printer
   connector. The following figure shows the pin numbers for the 6-pin
   connectors.

   CAPTION: Table C-1 25-Pin RS232-C Comm Port Interface Signals

   Pin Signal Mnemonic EIA/CCITT/DIN Description
   2 Transmitted data TXD BA/103/D1 From VT320
   Sends serial characters. Held in mark state when characters are not
   being sent.

   In modem control modes, sends data only when RTS, CTS, DSR, and DTR
   signals are on.
   3 Received data RXD BB/104/D2 To VT320

   if RLSD signal is off.
   4 Request to send RTS CA/105/S2 From VT320
   When on, places the modem in transmit mode.
   5 Clear to send CTS CB/106/M2 To VT320
   When on, tells the VT320 that the modem is ready to send.
   6 Data set ready DSR CC/107/M1 To VT320
   When on, tells the VT320 that the modem is in data mode and is ready to
   exchange RTS, CTS and RLSD signals.
   7 Signal ground SGND AB/102/E2 Serves as common ground reference
   potential for all connector signals, except protective ground.
   8 Receive line signal detect (carrier detect) RLSD CF/109/M5 To VT320

   line is good enough to ensure correct demodulation of received data.

   When off, indicates no signal received, or signal is unsuitable for
   demodulation.
   12 Speed indicator SPDI CI/112/M4 To VT320

   Pin Signal Mnemonic Description
   1 Data terminal ready DTR From VT320
   When on, tells the modem or printer that the VT320 is ready to send or
   receive.
   2 Transmitted data TXD+ From VT320
   Sends serial characters. Held in the mark state (-) when characters are
   not being sent.

   In modem control modes, sends data only when DSR and DTR signals are
   on.
   3 Transmit signal ground TXD- Provides the common ground reference
   potential for transmitted signals TXD+ and DTR.
   4 Receive signal ground RXD- Provides the common ground reference
   potential for received signals RXD+ and DSR.
   5 Received data RXD+ To VT320
   Receives serial characters.
   6 Data set ready DSR To VT320
   For the comm line: When on, tells the VT320 that the modem is in the
   data mode and is ready to communicate.

   For the printer line: Receives DTR on this line. If DSR is present at
   power-up, the printer controls print operations. If DSR is not present
   at power-up, the terminal checks for DSR before each print operation.
