Some arbitrary time after sending the original, I get a confirmation
mail.  It's normally long enough after that I've moved on from reading
zsh-workers, so it's a while (sometimes >1 day) before I check again and
see the confirmation mail finally made it in; I then reply to that.  An
empty body is fine.

As long as it's the same day, the SMTP envelope sender will be the same,
but I think the qconfirm stuff is using a cookie in the recipient
address so I don't need to confirm from the same original address if it
does no longer match.
