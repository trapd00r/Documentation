It's the same as the following from the FAQ (though you might not
immediately realise that it was the prompt deleting back to the first
column, which it is).


3.23: How do I prevent the prompt overwriting output when there is no newline?

  The problem is, for example,

    % echo -n foo
    % 

  and the foo has been overwritten by the prompt %.  The answer is
  simple:  put unsetopt promptcr in your .zshrc.  The option PROMPT_CR,
  to print a carriage return before a new prompt, is set by default because
  a prompt at the right hand side (`$RPROMPT', `$RPS1') will not appear
  in the right place, and multi-line editing will be confused about the line
  position, unless the line starts in the left hand column.  Apart from
  PROMPT_CR, you can force this to happen by putting a newline in the
  prompt (see question 3.13 for that).
