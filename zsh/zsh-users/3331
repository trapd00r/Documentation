This is more the sort of thing which I would like: a few simple routines
for pop-up messages and dialogue boxes. If that was implemented, what
would be good is if there were separate modules for Tk, gtk etc which
all had the same interface in zsh so they could be used interchangably.

I agree, most of the things a low level GUI interface in zsh could be
used for might be better written in something else like Python, Perl or
C.
