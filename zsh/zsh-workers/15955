I'm a rank newbie but I got zsh 4.0.2 to build on Darwin1.4/Mac OSX 10.1 by
commenting out two lines in the makefile that configure generated. The two
lines were:

# LIBLDFLAGS      =  -s
# EXELDFLAGS      =  -s

In the compilation section.

Make install didn't seem to to be set up for Darwin so I installed the
binaries and man pages by copping them over the zsh 3.0.8 equivalents which
comes installed with Darwin. This was basically putting the binaries in /bin
and the man pages in /usr/share/man/man1/

I don't know when, if ever, I'll understand configure well enough to
automate the build/install process but I would be glad to make binaries
available for manual installation.
