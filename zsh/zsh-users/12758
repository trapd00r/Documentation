} It's still a rather confusing bug since there's no indication you can
} can only do this with forward array indexing.

Er, but the doc quite correctly says you can't do *anything* else with
the (i) flag, and what you just wrote about (w) is actually wrong:

schaefer<521> print $X[(wi)p*] 
9
schaefer<522> print $X[(wr)p*]
paz
schaefer<523> print $X[(wR)f*]
foo

The (w) flag works just fine with (r) and (R), it's only (i) and (I)
that are oddballs.

} +separator is whitespace.  Currently this flag does not work
} +with reverse subscripting (the tt(i), tt(I), tt(r) and tt(R) flags).
