Subject: typo in _match?
Mime-Version: 1.0 (generated by tm-edit 7.106)

In zsh-3.1.9-dev-6, the last few lines of .../functions/_match are:

> [[ ret -eq 1 && "$ins" = yes &&
>    $#compstate[unambiguous] -ge ${#:-${PREFIX}${SUFFIX}} ]] && 
>     compstate[pattern_insert]=unambiguous
> 
> return 1-ret

Should the two occurrences of ret there be $ret instead?
