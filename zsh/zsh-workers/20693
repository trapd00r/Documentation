As Vin said, it's more about the _POSIX2_VERSION env variable and
the default value (defined at compile time of it).

_POSIX2_VERSION=199209 tail -1

should be OK, whatever the value of POSIXLY_CORRECT for
coreutils 5.2.1 at least.

(unset POSIXLY_CORRECT; _POSIX2_VERSION=200112 tail -1)
tail: `-1' option is obsolete; use `-n 1'
Try `tail --help' for more information.


But I seem to remember there was also a warning message in some
other version, and it may not have been triggered by the same
envvar values... sigh.
