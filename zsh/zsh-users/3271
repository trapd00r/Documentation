I have this completion function that I have a question on:

_p4_submit () {
    _arguments \
        '(-i)-c[changelist#]:changelist #' \
        '(-c)-i[input from stddin]' \
        ':submit file:_files'
}       

I have made -i and -c mutually exclusive.  How can I make all three
mutually exclusive?  This command accepts only one of the three
possible arguments.
