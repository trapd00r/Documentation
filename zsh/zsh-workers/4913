I think, that was never resolved, so I remind.

root@itsrm2:/usr/sadm/sysadm/add-ons/SIcdin/software_prod/software_on_cd/inf
o#> <====

This (with blank) is exactly 80 characters long. I am on dtterm with 25x80
size. If I now enter "cd" I have

cdot@itsrm2:/usr/sadm/sysadm/add-ons/SIcdin/software_prod/software_on_cd/inf
o#>c<====

Note, that I never get line shift, and for some reason the whole "cd" is
output again on "new" line.

My first thought was, it has something to do with am capability. Dtterm does
not have it on my system, and I normally configure it with 'line wrapping
enabled'. I tried different combinations of disabling line wrapping/setting
am in terminfo without any help. So it looks, like ZSH bug.
