The purpose is to record the GNU-style system identification string that
was used when configuring zsh.  The full system identification string is
"$MACHTYPE-$VENDOR-$OSTYPE".  Note that it is about the zsh configuration,
*not* the system on which zsh is running.

These three parameters should all be left as they are; they should be
directly comparable to the output of config.{guess,sub}.
