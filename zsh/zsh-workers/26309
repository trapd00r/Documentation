FWIW, I use a git import which doesn't do any keyword expansion, so
the define is empty in my case, which obviously breaks the build. I
don't know if you want to a) not care b) add some #ifdef to set it to
"unknown" or such or c) add some shell code for git to set it.

If b or c I can construct a patch.
