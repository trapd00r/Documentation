Time for the next unofficial release.  Version 3.1.2-zefram4 exists, and,
as before, ftp space is hereby requested.  I have made patches relative
to 3.1.2 and 3.1.2-zefram3.  The full release tar also contains man
pages and texinfo this time.

Changes
=======

There are lots of fixes for the build process.  There are a few
outstanding bug reports from zefram3, but I can't be sure which
reported bugs have actually been fixed.  Therefore please report any
build problems with zefram4, even if you previously reported the same
problem with zefram3.

Most nifty compctls that have been posted are included, though I don't
think any of them are unmodified.  Could the various authors please
check that I haven't broken anything.

Peter's KSH_GLOB patch is included, but I backed out a lot of the changes.
I'd like to have options affect as little as possible, preferably just one
thing each: KSH_GLOB in this version *only* affects the interpretation
of parens preceded by the magic characters (in fact, the option is
only tested on one line of the source).  Parens *not* preceded by the
magic characters are unaffected by the option.  Glob qualifies are also
unaffected: that `-', mandatory with KSH_GLOB and forbidden without,
was just too nasty to use.  I added an option BARE_GLOB_QUAL to enable
interpretation of glob qualifiers -- in a future version I'd like to add
an unambiguous syntax (maybe `(&...)') to make glob qualifiers available
in ksh emulation mode.

I also backed out the special handling of `(^...)', which changed
the semantics of `^' in an extremely non-obvious way.  You can use
`(^(...))' to invert the whole group.  This turned up a very old
bug in the exclusion handling: `(foo~bar)BAZ' is actually treated as
`fooBAZ~barBAZ', rather than the exclusion being properly localised.
This bug is not fixed in the zefram4 release -- it has taken long enough
already.  It'll be fixed in the next release, by me unless someone
else gets to it first.  The Misc/globtests scripts do a proper test of
exclusions, and so some of those tests currently fail.

The Zoltan Situation
====================

I think it's pretty obvious by now that Zoltan will not be taking an
active part in zsh development in the foreseeable future.  It's time to
start thinking about a permanent replacement in the post of maintainer.
Opinions are hereby solicited.
