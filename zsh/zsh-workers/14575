It's that problem.  I'm now getting two .RE's right at the end of the
`read' entry, which appears to be wrong.  Maybe your nroff simply doesn't
care if there's an extra release at that point (the one at Sourceforge
doesn't, either), while mine does.  Still looks like the fundamental
problem is in yodl (both in this case 1.31.18).
