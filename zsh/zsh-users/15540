Ben: sorry; I just sent this email only to you while it was intended
for the list. Here it goes again.


I get the same behaviour. I don't set
zstyle ':completion:*' accept-exact true
anywhere I'm aware of. In fact, zstyle -L ':completion:*' does not
show this setting. And, when I set it to false, behaviour changes, so
it was this option indeed.
