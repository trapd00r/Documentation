There is, isn't there.  The - seems to be right, almost.  How about 
**/*(@-^.,@-^/)

Meaning those symbolic links whose referents aren't files or directories?  On 
the other hand, I'll bet this won't work, because the property of existence is 
probably required when globbing.  The question is a good one though: there 
ought to be a way of doing this, and it probably ought to be an example in the 
manual, because it's a common enough task, and it would be cool to have a 
one-liner for small trees.
