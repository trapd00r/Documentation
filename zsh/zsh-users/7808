I'm interested in keeping my .zsh(rc|env) files synced across 3 
different machines.

Anyone have any good techniques for doing so, especially when there are 
some things ($PATH) which are different on each machine?

Should I have separate .zshenv files and the same .zshrc file perhaps?

Do .zshrc and .zshenv both get used when logging in (ssh)?

Thanks!
