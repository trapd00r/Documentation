The problem occurs on line 31 of _files which is:
  for i in ${tmp//%p/${${glob:-\*}//:/\\:}}; do

Changing it to:
  for i in ${tmp//\%p/${${glob:-\*}//:/\\:}}; do

allows it to work again but I can't see any good reason why the `%'
should need to be quoted so I assume that this is a bug introduced with
the recent changes to quoting in these substitutions.
