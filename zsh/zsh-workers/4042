When translating yodl to info, the tt() text style comes out like this:

	`teletype'

That means that if the yodl source looks like:

	with the SUBJECT `tt(subscribe) var(<e-mail-address>)'

then it displays in info as:

	with the SUBJECT ``subscribe' <E-MAIL-ADDRESS>'

which is both misleading and strange-looking.  It gets even worse when you
get to things like:

	`for ((' [EXPR1] `;' [EXPR2] `;' [EXPR3] `)) do' LIST `done'

There's no perfect solution for this; the best would probably be for tt()
text to simply be inserted plain, without styling, for info purposes.  That
in turn probably means fooling with what goes into zsh.texi, using @ifinfo;
I'm not even sure it's possible.
