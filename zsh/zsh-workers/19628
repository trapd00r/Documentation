I really don't know anything about the pcre module, so I'm forwarding
this to zsh-workers.

Subject: segfault with pcre_study alone

hi bart,
greetings from hamburg/germany.
i today when playing with pcre-module found out that pcre_study alone
leads to a segfault when invoked without using pcre_compile.
seems to be at all versions i tried. for some strange reason debian does
no longer come with pcre-module so i compiled zsh myself and used
zsh-4.2-pre4 for it.

        Matthias
