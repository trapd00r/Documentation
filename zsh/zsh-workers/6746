Ahem ... I've never used GNU ls, so, what should I put in there? I believe, it
is better be described in Zsh doc.

I just looked fileutils-4.0. Man page for ls says nothing; info has entry for
dircolors that just tells, that it's output should be assigned to LS_COLORS
variables and suggests running dircolors --print-database for more info :-) I
don't have fileutils (and won't have on this system)

So - what should I put in ZLS_COLORS to get colored listing?
