Hello,

Running from the latest CVS sources, the following gives me an error:

Wed 7 15:10; ls $SRCROOT/<TAB>
_path_files:211: bad pattern: [^\

Apparently, this was caused by Peter's change to subst.c.  I tried to
modify _path_files by taking out the double backslash at line 211, but
that did not produce the desired results.

  - Vin
