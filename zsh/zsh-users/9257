As a compromise, I would suggest using the following:
(you need to autoload zargs first, either manually or in your .zshrc)

zargs -- **/*.bz2(.oL) -- ls -lU

This should work better than the for-loop because zargs calls ls with a few 
thousand arguments at a time, resulting in much fewer calls.
Although the manpage for ls claims that -U displays files without sorting, "in 
whatever order they are stored on the disk", on my system it displays them in 
the order of the arguments it is called with. Therefore, you can use any 
combination of sorting that zsh provides.
