    I still haven't solved this, and I've carried a lot of tests. Is
any way of using '%{%}' constructs, or escape sequences, using psvar?
I would like to 'chop' my PS1 into some pieces and use psvar for
that, but then I cannot use colours unless I move the escape
sequences out of the psvar array. Of course I can always use
$psvar[], but then my PS1 is longer and I want to have it as short as
possible to easily manage it, and I'm curious about what I'm missing
here, which may be just a simple quoting matter, or some limitation
of %v in prompts.

    Thanks a lot :)
