Well, specifically debugging completion functions you do not actually have 
control over it; functions just appear to return out of the middle without 
any apparent reason.

It looks intentional:

    /* Obsolescent sh compatibility: set - is the same as set +xv *
     * and set - args is the same as set +xv -- args              */
    if (*args && **args == '-' && !args[0][1]) {
        dosetopt(VERBOSE, 0, 0);
        dosetopt(XTRACE, 0, 0);
        if (!args[1])
            return 0;
    }

Anyone remembers the reasons for that? May be we can at least relax it if 
running in emulate zsh mode?
