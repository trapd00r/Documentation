[patch...]

    IT WORKS... I was testing with a script that had a bang path so
it was my old 4.0.9 who was failing. I sourced the script and now it
works O:)

    It works perfectly, all possible matches are presented if no
partial match is specified, sorted alphabetically (I mean, not
grouped by array of origin), and if I specify a partial match,
matches from *both* arrays are presented.

    Excuse me for the last message O:)
