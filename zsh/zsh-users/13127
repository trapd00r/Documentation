Could you actually get color for this?  I have:

export WATCHFMT="       %D       [%B%t%b]       %B%n%b \
%(a:%Blogged on%b:logged off)       %B%l%b       from       %B%M%b"

which puts "logged on" into a boldface (which boldface I have set to a gold
color); and "logged off" into a nonbold, which I have as my standard
grey-ish text color.

But I don't know how to put this text in color.  It would be great to have
"logged on" appear in green, say, and "logged off" in, say, blue or some
other color.

They accused us of suppressing freedom of expression.
This was a lie and we could not let them publish it.
