As is probably already clear from the examples I gave, I really meant
'inaccurate' (which is the particular concern) or 'needing improvement'.

However, I think we do sometimes get comments where someone has been
confused by the documentation and says so.  The trouble is it's usually
not possible to work out from someone's confusion what to do to improve
the docs.  That's why I'm really keen on getting suggestions afterwards
that say explicitly I got confused *here* and I could have done with a
better pointer *here*.  If someone was confused and has been put in the
right direction by the list, this should be useful for future readers.
