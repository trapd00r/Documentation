# That's an easy first thing to try...
# 
# One issue related to the multibyte changes is that zsh now pays much
# more attention to the locale.  As you say the accented characters used
# to work in the past, I presume that means they are in a single-byte font
# (something like ISO-8859-1 or ISO-8859-15 being the most likely).  Is
# your locale set up appropriately?  If "print $LANG" shows you something
# including UTF-8 (or similar) the answer may well be "no", at least for
# the encoding you are using.

$ echo $LANG

$ setopt print_eight_bit
$ <00e4><00f6><00fc>
zsh: command not found: הצ

None of the LC_* variables is set, either.
