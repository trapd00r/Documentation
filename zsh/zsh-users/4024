Oh yes, that makes a difference!

I posted to the list about this problem a short while ago.  Check the 
archives for a thread "Zsh observations".  Andrej Borsenkow sent a patch 
that fixes the problem.

(The problem is that zsh doesn't find "/bin/cvs", but 
"/bin/cvs.exe".  Therefore, it tries to correct "cvs" to the closest it can 
find, which is the autoloaded "_cvs" function.)
