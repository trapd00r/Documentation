This is SuSe 7.0 that has setopt recexact in its /etc/zshrc (arghhh).
My problem had nothing to do with zsh versions..

Recently, I found a truer "bug" in SuSe's startup files: /etc/profile
sets alias ls='eval /bin/ls $LS_OPTIONS'.
Appart of the question whether it is sensible to expand $LS_OPTIONS every time
you do ls, this distroys arguments with spaces. (confession: I do not fully
understand why)
Anyway, my solution for that was alias ls='ls `echo $LS_OPTIONS`'.


Dan.
