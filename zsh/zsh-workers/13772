I gather that the reason I was wrong there is because $state may
contain something before the call to _arguments (an may not be a local)
and without ->state actions, it would be unchanged.

I think doing something like this would definitely be a good idea. I
think it is better if the functions for user commands (like _bzip2) are
kept simpler at the expense of things like _arguments and _x_arguments.
I suppose the latter will also need to take the new option and when
called without it will need to use compstate[nmatches].
