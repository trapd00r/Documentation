After a very cursory look at the (synopsis in the) smbclient manual,
I'd sayy that you probably were better of copying not too much from
_cvs. That is pretty complicated because of the sub-command handling
which doesn't seem to be needed for smbclient.

And I'd like to point you to Peter's User Guide again. It contains a
short introduction to using _arguments that might be helpful
(together, as Andrej said, with the example functions from the
distribution).

Indeed. Any help will be greatly appreciated.

Yes.


For some of the things you wrote in 13052 I know or almost know the
reason, but I don't have enough time now. Maybe tomorrow...
