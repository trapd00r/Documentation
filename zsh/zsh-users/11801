} why i want this: i've tweaked my ~/.zshrc file to fill in the tabs of

Have a look at the variables jobdirs, jobtexts, and jobstates in the
zsh/parameter module.  Or there's a lazier way out:

} unless there's a way to simulate the fg command (ie; a "-n" dry run 
} argument)

The "jobs" command should accept all the same job-identifier patterns
as "fg", and in recent zsh "jobs" doesn't lose track of the job list
when run in a subshell, so you can do things like

    fg() {
	# Obviously this needs error handling added, etc.
    	typeset -g fgjob=$(jobs $*)
	builtin fg $*
    }

and then stuff the title bar (or whatever) with the something parsed
out of $fgjob.
