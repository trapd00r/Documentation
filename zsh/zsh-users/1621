That's why I use ~/tmp ;-) See the difference? :-)

Well, I have that in my .zshrc, no cronjob needed. But then, sometimes
the creating of the list when logging in is annoying...

Or zsh ;-)

Well... my completion was written within 3 minutes and I didn't test how
long it would take to find all the manpages on-the-fly. But if I think
how long it takes to build the file (some seconds), I think it's too
slow to run every time I need the completion...

OK, acknowledged :)

*looking*
tips.html is pretty cool :-)
compctl.html should have more explanations, but is OK :)

CU,
Thomas [still not having a zsh page]
