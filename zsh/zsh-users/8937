Subject: selecting a subset of an array
Date: Thu, 2 Jun 2005 16:28:03 +0900

X-Spam-Hits: -2.6

Sorry for another basic question, but how do I exclude a particular  
element from an array by using its name in a parameter expansion?   
For example, I would like to select everything except for  
'foo1:output file' from the following array, using only 'foo1' in the  
expansion.

_list=( 'foo1:output file' 'foo2:input file' 'foo3:output figs'  
'foo4:input figs' )

Help is much appreciated.
