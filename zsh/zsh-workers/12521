} But we need some kind of solution. I'm getting this with a normal
} True64 Unix installation (so it has nothing to do with any glibc
} whatsoever).

There are a couple of things we could do.

One, we could pitch out the path length test and simply let domkdir()
fail -- and perhaps test the value of errno to decide whether to break
or continue as a result.

Two, we could cause zpathmax() to lop off the tail of the path and call
itself until it actually does find a maximum path length, then add the
tail back on and repeat the strlen() test.  That might be a good thing
to have for the general case anyway.

Or we could do both of the above.
