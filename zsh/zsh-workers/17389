Subject: Bugs in set_buffer?
Date: Mon, 01 Jul 2002 11:49:25 +0100
Message-ID: <26657.1025520565@csr.com>
From: Peter Stephenson <pws@csr.com>

This has been there a long time, but is it right? 

  /**/
  static void
  set_buffer(Param pm, char *x)
  {
      if(x) {
	  unmetafy(x, &ll);
	  sizeline(ll);
	  strcpy((char *)line, x);
	  zsfree(x);
	  if(cs > ll)
	      cs = ll;
      } else
	  cs = ll = 0;
      fixsuffix();
      menucmp = 0;
  }

If the unmetafy() had any effect, then x may (i) contain a NULL, so the
strcpy() should be a memcpy() (this is exactly why we need ll at all),
(ii) be a different length from the one supplied, so zsfree() isn't good
enough to free it properly.

Have I missed something?
