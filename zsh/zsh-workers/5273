If you have a file `Maﬂe', this appears in a completion list as
`Ma\M-_e' since metafied characters are treated specially.

I vaguely remember a discussion about this but I don't remember why it 
was decided to print them in this way (and I mean metafied characters
that are printable). Or was this just an oversight? Giving people
using such filenames what they deserve?

Can anyone remind me?

Bye
 Sven
