It *should* be possible to do something like this:

  _files_belonging_to_pws() { _path_files -g '*(#qu:pws:)'; }

This basically works, but you'll find that the completion system
adds directories belonging to all users behind your back.  A quick
search suggests this is all part of the undocumented complexity of
_path_files in at least two different ways, so I didn't look further.
