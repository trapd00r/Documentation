There was also Completion/README at 1.1.1.6.

I think I've fixed this, but you might want to update and compare some
files to make sure.  What I did was the equivalent of the following for
each file:

cvs update -r1 file
cvs update -p -r1.1.1 file >file
cvs commit file
cvs update -A file

Comparing with a previously synced set of revisions seemed to show this
worked OK.

There are various files still at 1.1.1.1.  I haven't fixed these.
