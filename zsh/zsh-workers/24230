Thanks for letting us know.

This suggests the right library to use on OpenBSD is curses, right?
In that case I hope the following patch works.  We won't be able to test
this...  it would be great if you were able to ASAP.  I can send the
corresponding configure if you need it.

You should also find it compiles with --with-term-lib=curses.

Thanks
