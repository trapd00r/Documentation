} Some more thoughts about the user guide. The guide is, overall, well

} 1) Mark the terms appearing for the first time in *bold*,
} 2) A comprehensive index.
} Does that sound fine to you all? If so, I'll take some time to improve

Just to be sure ... you're talking about
    http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Guide/zshguide.html
??

We'd certainly welcome any help with the guide (or any other docs, for
that matter) so do jump in and send us suggested improvements.  As for
(1) in particular ... although the guide can be read linearly it's
really more intended to to be navigated as hypertext, so adding more
cross-references to places where terms are explained would probably be
more useful than merely highlighting the "first" place they are used.
Which ought to be possible if you're constructing an index anyway.

Based on SourceForge's progress so far we might have our CVS back by
sometime on Friday.
