Etc/zsh-development-guide:

* Send only context diffs "diff -c oldfile newfile" or unified diffs
  "diff -u oldfile newfile".  They are much easier to read and
  understand while also allowing the patch program to patch more
  intelligently.  Please make sure the filenames in the diff header
  are relative to the top-level directory of the zsh distribution; for
  example, it should say "Src/init.c" rather than "init.c" or
  "zsh/Src/init.c".
