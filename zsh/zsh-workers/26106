I noticed that your patch modifies _pdf to complete for Okular.  I
don't think you want to do that.  Okular is used for viewing documents
for many different formats like PostScript and DVI files.  By setting
its completion function to _pdf you are preventing it from completing
any of the other formats.  It would be better to create a new function
which uses _pdf and the other relevant completion functions.
