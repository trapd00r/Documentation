Subject: completion colors differ on BSD/Linux

Hi,

I have in my ~/.zshrc following line:

zstyle ':completion:*:default' list-colors
"${(s.:.)LS_COLORS}"

On a Linux, completion colors match nicely to colors
of GNU ls. But on *BSD, directories are red and tar/gz
are uncolored. Sym links and executables same as on
Linux. On Linux LS_COLORS has tons of definitions, on
*BSD it is empty. Replacing "${(s.:.)LS_COLORS}" with
'' doesn't help. The problem exists on xterm and on
console.

Any ideas what's going on here?
