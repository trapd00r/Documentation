You can't.  Environment variables are local to processes (and may get 
inherited by child processes, but that doesn't help here).

You can do something like (warning: untested code ahead):

PATH=$(echo $PATH | sed 's|/usr/local/lib/TeX|/usr/local/teTeX|')

You could stick this in a shell function (possibly autoloaded) or an alias.
