The mistake is that the ~'s are quoted, so don't expand to your home
directory: try `echo ~ "~"' and you will see what I mean.  You need
something like:

export MAILPATH=~/.mailspool/rusty:~/Mail/z'?Zsh mail.'

(zsh does know about assignments and colons when expanding ~'s).  This
is partly my fault:  I had something in the FAQ when the shell was
rationalised to quote tildes in this sort of place, but deleted it
when I thought it was no longer necessary.
