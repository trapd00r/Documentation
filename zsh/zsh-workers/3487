I haven't changed lete2ctl because as far as I know it still works.  I
shall fix any specific problems reported.

It might work a little better if we had special directory completion, like
tcsh, instead of relying on ordinary globbing.  Maybe it's time we bit
the bullet and did this:  I can't believe the code would be large or
difficult.
