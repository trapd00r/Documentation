Hey,

I'm trying to set Alt-h to be a backwards-delete-word, like in emacs, 
but can't figure out how to do this.

I have tried setting in .zshrc a line that says:
"bindkey '\M-h' backward-delete-word

But Alt-h still runs help on the currently typed command.

It almost appears as if Alt-H is hardwired to help as far as I can tell.

Regards,
Wingot
