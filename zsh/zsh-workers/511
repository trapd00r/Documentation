My patch contained the code to disable history saving on exec from an init
script.  The reason for that (as I wrote it when I posted the patch) is that
the history file is loaded after all of the init scripts have been completed.
Therefore whe history is empty in initialisation time, unless someone loads it
explicitely with fc.  Certainly noone wants to save an empty history.
