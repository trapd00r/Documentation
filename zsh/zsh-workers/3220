Dear&nbsp; Developer:

<P>World Creations has just released the Java development kit "BRAIN
<BR>TOOLS". Everyone knows&nbsp; there is an abundance of dull and uncaptivating
<BR>sites out in the World Wide Web, But! yours doesn't have to fall in
that
<BR>category. That's why World Creations has developed "BRAIN TOOLS". BRAIN
<BR>TOOLS brings a site to life, it is designed for beginners but has a
<BR>expert finish. Java as we know it is quite complicated and time
<BR>consuming, but with BRAIN TOOLS you produce the quality of professional
<BR>sites like Disney and Microsoft and in less than half the time. BRAIN
<BR>TOOLS are&nbsp; inexpensive and very easy to develop! NO PROGRAMMING
OR CODE
<BR>HACKING NECESSARY.

<P>Please take the time to visit the BRAIN TOOLS web site for a
<BR>comprehensive description of the kit.
