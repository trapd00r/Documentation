hi all!

What's the reason for unsetting promptsubst with 
prompt redhat or with
prompt suse after doing autoload promptinit && promptinit.
Both unset my existing setopt promptsubst.

ps: i, too, have had current 'job table full' -message again with latest
    cvs-zsh.
    this happens for at least 8 weeks, but i still cannot find the reason!
    This here is a "me, too!"
