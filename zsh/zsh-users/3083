Is anyone of you running zsh 3.1.6/7 on HP-UX 11.00?

While anything worked well with HP-UX 10.20, I have some
trouble getting zsh to work on HP-UX 11.00:

Compiling zsh with the native HP-UX-cc-Compiler completes without any
problems ,
running zsh yields error messages like "can't find termcap info for
xterm"
and various coredumps (e.g. when running the function compinstall)
