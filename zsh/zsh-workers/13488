        As a followup to my report of failures, I did get 07cond.ztst
failing and the directory in question was mounted NFS.  


        I just double checked on another machine with a local build
dir and 07cond passes fine there.  But 55arguments fails with the
local build dir on this other box as well (with the same output as in
my previous message).


        Configuration for this other box:
