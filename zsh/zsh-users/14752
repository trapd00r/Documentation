It's easy and harmless (I hadn't quite realized it worked as a script).
We've used /bin/zsh elsewhere and that's often good enough these days.

I found an oddity:  I assumed zed needed to be run with zsh -i since it
uses zle, but it turns out someone (quite possibly me) fixed vared so it
can be run in a non-interactive shell.  If you *do* use the -i option,
however, you get output at the end along the lines of

../Functions/Misc/zed:zsh:100: use 'exit' to exit.

This is because it's hitting end-of-file.  That's fine in an interactive
shell, except that we have a "return" just before, which at top level
should act as an exit.  It doesn't because there's a test not to do that
in an interactive shell, which is reasonable for protecting an
interactive user, but shouldn't be necessary if reading from a script,
so I've changed that.  (Sourcing files still does the right thing.)

Feel free to argue that the "use 'exit' to exit" warning shouldn't apply
if !isset(SHINSTDIN), either.

Thanks, I don't know how that escaped.
