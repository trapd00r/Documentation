I guess I had assumed that there would be some way to disable from
executing automatically without getting rid of it altogether, based
on this text from the man page:

  If no personal intialization files exist for the current user, a
  function is run to help you change some of the most common
  settings. It won't appear if your administrator has disabled the
  zsh/newuser module. The function is designed to be self-explanatory.
  You can run it by hand with...

which seems to indicate that it can still be run manually after it's
disabled.

Also, anyone who installs zsh from a distro package would have to
manually re-remove that script file each time their package was
upgraded.
