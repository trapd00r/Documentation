Adding the ./ prefix certainly helps, as Vim won't see the + signs as
special any more.  However, the solution I was looking for would
automatically add the ./ prefix when completing a filename beginning
with a + (perhaps only if vim is the command in command position).  So
I need even more basic information than the compadd command-line.  I was
hoping it could be done using zstyles.
