No, I didn't mean graphics. Certainly not.

What I meant was the up-to-date'ness (the `this is coming true no' at
http://sunsite.auc.dk/zsh/about.html has been around since when?),
probably links to Adam's zsh page with the automatically created rpm
files and to Peter's Guide (it definitely is useful already).

And later (when 3.2/4.0 is out or before(?)) we could think about
adding some kind of function repository so that people can keep their
collection of zle widgets, completion functions etc. up-to-date
without having to get the whole tarball every time.

Or something like that...

Bye
 Sven
