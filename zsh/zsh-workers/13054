I don't think it's really true.... I've never had anything odd about
smbclient's argument ordering.  I was going to use cvs as a model
since it is smart enough to use cvs with some of the existing
arguments to get the module list.  The same type of idea could be used
do completion for share names once the server has been specified.

I'll use this as incentive to get my current project finished -- my
reward will be letting myself play with zsh completion functions. :-)
It will probably be at least a week before I can start it.

You can count on it!  Once I get up to a certain level of competence
I'd like to do a thorough cover-to-cover read of the zsh documentation
with red pen in hand.  (I'll probably print the .yo files directly --
easier to generate patches and make comments that way.  Besides, I've
been considering whether to use yodl for some of my own documentation.
This way I could find out whether I like it or not. :-]) I have
written enough documentation to know how important it is to have a
fresh set of eyes read it.  One eventually becomes immune to errors in
one's own writing. :-) I don't know when I'll get to this but
hopefully before the next non-development release which I guess is
supposed to be 4.0?

See above.  Thanks.
