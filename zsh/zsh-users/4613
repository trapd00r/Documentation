I fought this problem too, and the fix was similar.  In HP-UX
11.00, they redefined the output values of tgetent to 0 (OK) and
-1 (ERR).  0 used to mean there was no such term capability.

The old tgetent is still available in the libHcurses library. 
Putting LDFLAGS='-lHcurses' fixed the problem for me.
