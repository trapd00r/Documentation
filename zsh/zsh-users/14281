You can make completion after c:/ work with

  zstyle ':completion:*' accept-exact-dirs true

This has the side effect (which, if you have slow network file access from
Cygwin as I do, is a major usability enhancement) that you don't get
partial-path completion of existing directories, i.e. in
/foo/bar/stuff<TAB> if "foo" and "bar" exist it won't try to look for foo*
and bar*, which is what completion does by default.  Actually, that's the
main effect; the side effect is that if c: exists the shell won't do
anything clever (i.e. stupid) with it.

This is a workaround---I don't know what the underlying difference is and
_path_files and its utilities are a disaster area.  Changing it always
somehow seems to make it more rather than less obscure no matter how much
time you spend on getting it right (and I for one have spent days of my
life).
