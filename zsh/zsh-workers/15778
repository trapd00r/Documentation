I think it is better as Bart suggested with the option to specify a
choice of fd because for everything else, you need to manage fd numbers
yourself.

What might be quite useful though is some sort of special variable
which would generate an unused fd number so you can do something like:
  ztcp -u ${fd:=$NEWFD} host:port
and then use $fd thereafter for the file descriptor.

I doubt there will be any spec for quite some time. I also doubt that
bash or any other particular shell will be declared the reference
implementation though any new feature will need at least one
implementation.
