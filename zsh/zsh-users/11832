There should be lots of files beginning with "_", as well as "compinit".

There are a lot of functions starting with _ in
/usr/share/zsh/4.3.4/functions

If you remove .zcompdump,

Removing ~/.zcompdump and then manually running compinit manually did the
trick.  Now ~/.zcompdump seems to be populated nicely and I can create more
zsh instances and it's working fine.

So then, I will formally thank you for your help!  I was lost .. . I'm still
not sure what caused this, but now I'm glad it's back.

Thanks again,
