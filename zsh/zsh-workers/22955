Ok, I have an even weirder test case for the "job control in cursh
construct" bug... No arguments, %-, %+, and even %2 work as expected,
but %1 doesn't?

~>{ jobs }

~>{ jobs %- }
jobs: no previous job
~>jobs %-
jobs: no previous job

~>{ jobs %+ }
jobs: no current job
~>jobs %+

~>{ jobs %1 }
~>jobs %1
jobs: %1: no such job

~>{ jobs %2 }
jobs: %2: no such job

~>jobs %2
jobs: %2: no such job
