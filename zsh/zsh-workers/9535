I think it's a POSIX requirement that atime must be updated.
 
Lots of unixes do let let you disable atime updates though (usually by
mount -o noatime).  It's useful for news servers or FTP archives that
do a lot of reading and don't really care about the atime field.  I
looked on my Solaris 2.6 box and there doesn't seem to be a way to
disable atime updates.  7 or 8 might very well be able to, though.
