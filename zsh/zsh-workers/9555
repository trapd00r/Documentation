Found it. getkey() in zle_main.c now resets `breaks' to the value it had 
before, so that the new value stored in bin_break() set by the signal
handler doesn't make it through to the execution code.

Dunno where this comes from, though. If it turns out that this is
wrong (at least doing it unconditionally as we do it now), we can
remove the tests in loop.c again.
