I've had trouble getting it to work as well which I assumed was to do
with it not having a tty. I tried the same trick with timedc and mailx
aswell with varying problems. Are there any tricks we can do so that the
programs think they have a terminal because it is potentially a very
useful idea? If we can get it to work reliably a generic function for
the purpose as Sven suggested would be a good idea. Can anyone think of
any other programs which it might be useful for?
