Committed with changes, thanks for the feedback.

By the way, there's still a test failing in 4.0; it appears that the
patch for B02typeset.ztst needed as a consequence of another parameter
fix hasn't been applied to the 4.0 branch.

I will have a grand release fest when I can summon the time and energy.
To answer Geoff's question of a few days ago, I won't be going away
again until late June.
