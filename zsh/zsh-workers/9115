Subject: trailing slash mandatory in cdpath list?

Hello..

Is there some reason for cdpath to require a trailing slash after each
element to work? Or could zsh's cdpath-handling code overlook a missing
/?

If not, maybe the documentation could mention it. On the other hand,
maybe it doesn't need to :).

I'm sorry I have no patches, I thought I'd just mention it..

Markus
