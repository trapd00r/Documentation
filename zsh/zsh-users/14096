No need for taking the current word into account yourself.

I don't quite know if I fully understand what you're after, but
consider this:

~/.j:
[snip]
/foo/bar|34|1234
/foo/baz|54|1434
/fop/bag|64|3234
[snap]

j_complete() {
  local -a dirs
  dirs=( ${${$(<~/.j)}%%\|*} )
  compadd $dirs
}

% compdef j_complete j
% j <tab>
results in 'j /fo'

% j /foo<tab>
results in 'j /foo/ba'

% j /home<tab>
results in 'j /home'

By common convention, completion functions are named starting in an
underscore. So you'd name your completion _j_complete().

If you do so, you could also put it into a file names _j_complete in
your $fpath, like this:

[snip]
#compdef j
local -a dirs
dirs=( ${${$(<~/.j)}%%\|*} )
compadd $dirs
[snap]

If that's in a directory in your $fpath before calling compinit,
compinit will take care of calling compdef for you. You could also
distribute the completion via your github repository.
