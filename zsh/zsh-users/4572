} I don't use it but I tried setting it and it changed nothing.

OK, that means there can only be one other reason for this happening:
the directory containing `sudo' is not readable.  That is, it has execute
permission set so that by giving the full path to `sudo' you are allowed
to execute the file, but an `ls' on that directory would deny permission.

In this event, `which' searches for and adds to the hash table the single
command by full name, and therefore succeeds, whereas the spell checker
and `rehash -f' try to examine all names in the directory and therefore
fail.
