I'll generate those formats, and send you a link to a tarball of them 
for uploading.

Ick.  Sorry (but not that surprised) to hear that.  Hopefully we'll get 
it sorted.

There's one problem with the HTML docs, though -- while they now have 
good, transparent names, the internal anchors are still opaque 
numerical forms.  I'll regenerate the docs locally, and see what might 
have happened.  And I'll include the HTML in the tarball, so you can 
use my version if it's not working to generate it yourself.

Thanks again for uploading the new version (and thanks in advance for 
uploading the corrected one ;-) )
