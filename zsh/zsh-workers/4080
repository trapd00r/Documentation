No, the only time history-search-backward omits the space is if you
start the search without a space on the line:

% ech<M-p>

As opposed to these:

% ech <M-p>
% ech command<M-p>

These examples only search for the command "ech", as opposed to
the prefix "ech".

You missed the following increment of histpos if it is less than ll
(i.e., if we found a space).  This is identical to how 3.0.5 works.
