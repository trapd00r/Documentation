I don't know if this is exactly what you're looking for, but I think you can 
save yourself some work by just using direct operations.

Prepending/Appending:
path=( prepended $path appended )

I never bothered about a deletion function, because I simply use:
typeset -U path
which will keep only the first occurence of any element.

Hope this is of some help,

Christian
