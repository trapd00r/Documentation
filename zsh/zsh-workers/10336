} `alias run-help=zman', right?

You're talkng to the original CSH_JUNKIE, Sven.  I have a shell function
named `alias' that pastes in the `=' for me and then calls the builtin.  I
often forget about that when cutting snippets for posting.

} 
} And it is really weird? And a problem? With FPATH=$f you say it should 
} search the directory .../run-help

D'oh!  How silly ... but that still doesn't explain how the function got
loaded in the first place!  Because it *is* loaded by the end of zman,
it just didn't *execute* during zman.  If it were just not loaded at all,
I'd be less mystified.

} FPATH=$f:h, I think. Or maybe everybody thinks we should also check if 
} the elements of $fpath are the names of the funtions searched?

No, no, it was just me making a typo when updating the function from its
form for a previous version of zsh.  That's why "it always worked before."

But fixing $f:h doesn't have any effect on the rest of the wierd exported
FPATH behavior that I described.
