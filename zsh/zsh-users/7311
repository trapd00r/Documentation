They're the contexts and tags used for setting completion styles.

"man zshcompsys" or the equivalent info doc pages.

Aha!  You're using the _expand completer.  That's where those home
directories are coming from.

Various styles you can experiment with (you probably don't want to start
with all of them at once):

zstyle ':completion:*:expand:*' keep-prefix true
zstyle ':completion:*:expand:*' accept-exact continue
zstyle ':completion:*:expand:*' subst-globs-only true

I find the accept-exact one to be the most useful.
