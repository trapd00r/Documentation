I looked at this a little more closely --- it turns out it's not
ksh-compatible: running ksh on a file containing

print this is before
exec <file
print this is after

shows that it doesn't change command input to stdin, only input for
'read' etc.

It might therefore be better to implement this a more specific way,
like handling `setopt interactive' specially, then passing initio() or
whatever a flag saying whether it has to switch to using stdin for
input.  This is certainly feasible, though probably it ought to wait:
it looks like being a bigger change than I'd hoped to do it properly.
If done properly, though, interactive sessions should be able to
behave just like they usually do.
