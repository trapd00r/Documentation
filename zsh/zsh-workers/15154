} This does not touch everything (I need some time to swallow the rest :-)
} 
} What happens in this case:
} 
} foo() {
}   typeset -n r=v
}   local v=foo
}   echo $r
} }
} 
} v=bar
} foo
} 
} I.e. does r refer to outer v ("by address" could you say) or to inner
} v ("by name" would it be then)? The latter would be badly broken; but
} to implement the former you must have reference to pm not the name.

You actually don't need the reference, you just need both the name and the
local-level.

Oliver's partial implementation got this right, by stashing the target
local-level in the reference's `ct' field, and then after looking up the
parameter by name, searching its `old' linked list for the right `level'.
But using a pointer directly to the pm is a lot faster.
