No.  The way it's done in Elate, the shell just treats the structured
variable name as an opaque string.  It's only convention that interprets
the name as having structure.  Associative arrays is a completely
separate issue.

That's relatively easy.  We already have some support for linked
parameters.

I'd like to do that too.
