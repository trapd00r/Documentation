I presume you get some kind of error message that leads you to believe
this is a limits problem?

Some versions of Sun operating systems have problems executing processes
if there's too much stuff in the environment.  I'd be surprised if Sol 2.6
was still susceptible, but it's possible.  You don't use `setopt allexport`
in zsh or anything silly like that, do you?

} My question is why is this happening and how can I fix it?  (I have 24

} there any way to increase the limit any more..

Have you tried the `unlimit` command (note the "n") which with no argument
should increase all limits to their maximum allowed values?
