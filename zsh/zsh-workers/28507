Subject: Vi motion commands and $BUFFER
MIME-version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Fooling with 33facebook's "dl" complaint, I find "zle .vi-delete" (and
any other vi command that must be followed with a motion to set the
operating range) appears to fail when used in a wrapper that makes
any kind of modification to BUFFER/LBUFFER/RBUFFER.  Even saving and
restoring CURSOR doesn't help.

This doesn't appear to affect the motions themselves, just commands
that use getvirange() internally.
