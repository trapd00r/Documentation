Subject: PATCH: Tiny documentation fix

The documentation was still referencing the old mailing list location in
one place.

Has anyone heard from zefram lately? If he isn't going to be back for a
while it might be wise to have an official change of coordinator.

The zsh-development-guide file states that diffs should be relative to
the top directory so, Doc/Zsh/metafaq.yo not zsh/Doc/Zsh/metafaq.yo. How
do I create diffs like this where the old and new filenames are the
same: I had to remove the .old from Doc/Zsh/metafaq.yo.old in the patch
below.
