With zsh 4.3.10, all of them: with the script

trap 'echo INT' INT
/usr/bin/emacs -Q -nw
echo OK

if I hit C-g 4 times, then C-x C-c to quit emacs, I get:

INT
INT
INT
INT
OK

when I run the script with zsh 4.3.10, but just

INT
OK

when I run the script with bash, ksh or zsh 4.2.3.
Why does zsh 4.3.10 behave differently?

With bash, the script exits, even though it doesn't exit in the
case of Ctrl-g in Emacs.

I've searched on Google, and found the explanations of the various
behaviors:

IMHO, zsh should implement WCE, just like bash.
