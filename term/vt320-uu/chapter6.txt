                             6 Printers and Modems

Printers

   The VT320 has a built-in serial printer interface that supports most
   draft and letter-quality printers, including the following Digital
   printers.

   LA12 LA38        LA120
   LA34 LA50        LQP02
   LA35 LA75        LQP03
   LA36 LA100/LA120

   You can select from four printing modes in the Printer Set-Up screen
   (Chapter 4): normal, auto print, printer controller, and local
   controller.

  Normal Mode: Printing Text from the Screen

   This mode lets you print displayed text by using the Print Screen key.

  Auto Print Mode: Printing Text from the Host System

   In this mode, the VT320 sends the current display line to the printer
   when the cursor moves to the next line after a line feed, form feed,
   vertical tab, or autowrap. Auto print mode lets you print each line of
   text as it is received from the host.

   While selected, "Auto Print Mode" appears on the status line. You can
   still perform printing functions with the Print Screen key in
   auto-print mode.

   You can also turn auto print mode on and off by pressing Ctrl-Print
   Screen. When you leave auto print mode, you return to normal print
   mode.

  Printer Controller Mode: Letting the Host Control the Printer

   In this mode, the host system can send text directly to the printer,
   without displaying the text on the terminal's screen. While selected,
   "Printer Controller Mode" appears on the status line.

   The Print Screen key does not work in printer controller mode.

  Local Controller Mode: Setting Up the Printer

   This mode lets you send information directly from the keyboard to the
   printer, without displaying the information on the screen. You may find
   this feature useful in setting up certain printers for operation,
   without involving the host system. To select this mode, you must set
   two different set-up features (Chapter 4).
    1. Set the On Line/Local feature in the Set-Up Directory screen to
       "Local".
    2. Set the Print Mode in the Printer Set-Up screen to "Printer
       Controller Mode".

   Remember to reset both features when you finish.

Modems

   A modem lets the VT320 communicate over a telephone line with a remote
   computer system. You can use a variety of modems with your VT320, such
   as Digital's DF03 and DF224 modems. You can also use compatible modems,
   such as the AT&T 103, 113, and 212 types. See Appendix B for
   information on ordering modems.

   The VT320 must be certified for connection to non-AT&T type modems used
   outside of continental North America. Your local Digital Field Service
   office has information on terminal certification and use of non-AT&T
   type modems.

   You can connect one of the standard modems listed above to the VT320 as
   follows.
    1. Connect the modem cable to the 25-pin RS232 connector on the rear
       of the terminal.
    2. Go to the Communications Set-Up screen (Chapter 4).
         1. Set the Host Port Selection feature to "RS232, Modem Control".
         2. Set the transmit and receive speeds to match your modem's.
