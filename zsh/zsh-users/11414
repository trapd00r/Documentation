I freshly compiled and installed on Cygwin and I get this is 
completion
% cd /[TAB]
[1;32m}directory[m}
bin/   cygdrive/   etc/   home/   lib/   proc/   sbin/   tmp/   usr/   
var/

I have this in my .zshenv
G=$'\e[1;32m'

and in my .zshrc:
zstyle ':completion:*' list-prompt "%{$G%}last line %l (%p)%{$r%}  %
{$W%}last match %m%{$r%}"
zstyle ':completion:*:descriptions' format "%{$G%}%d%{$r%}"
zstyle ':completion:*:messages'     format "%{$G%}%d%{$r%}"

4.3.2 was okay. I removed all .zwc files and .zcompdump before 
starting the shell.
