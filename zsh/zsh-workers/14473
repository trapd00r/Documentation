$ZFTP_SYSTEM appears to be unset. Did you mean $ZFTP_SESSION which is
`default'.

I'd probably do that but it'd be a hassle every time I upgrade zsh.
Would anyone object to having a style for this?

It isn't on the top of my list. I'm happy with wget etc for those sort
of things. zftp is really useful when you want to keep the session for a
while and mix it with other commands.

Yes, or whatever the default is after running zfinit. The only
configuration I've done of zftp is making sure zstyle -d is after zfinit
to clear the default styles.

Yes. That sounds like the sort of thing I was expecting to be the
problem.
