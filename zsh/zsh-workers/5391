And before I forget to mention this: people using the new style
completion stuff may have noticed that completion after `$', `=', and
`~' still automagically works if complist is used independent of the
options given to it. This is due to the fact that this is still
handled very deeply in the completion code. I was thinking about
skipping over this code when the completion code is called from a
completion widget and instead testing for it and reporting this to the 
widget as different CONTEXTs. This sound like the correct behavior, right?

Bye
 Sven
