IMO a list that can be changed would be better than just checking for
/dev/null. An example on my system is the sound devices /dev/audio,
/dev/dsp*, but these are system dependent (although used from scripts). 
(devices should be protected though unless specifically given, for 
disks etc.)

In fact, maybe that's YAOption? I don't have NO_CLOBBER turned on,
it's too annoying. But I would if it could be restricted to some
places (/, /dev, maybe /usr).
