} Yes, and that's what the original example above was about -- the
} `user' `invented' the tag names `foo' and `bar', linking them to the
} `method' `files'. And before that I made the suggestion to allow the
} file-patterns style to contain invented tag names.

So where do the method names come from?  I don't think we want this to
be so configurable that, for example, the file-patterns style could be
caused to generate parameter names.  Do we?
