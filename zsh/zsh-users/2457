Hm, I just had a look at this. If I've counted correctly, there are 38 
symbols used. Four of them could reasonably be put into minfo. But
adding 34 pointer variables just to support SunOS 4? And then: other
modules may rely (now or in the future) on the symbols of other
modules on which they depend anyway (after all this is one of the
reasons for the dependency system, isn't it?).
