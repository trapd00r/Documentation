} We did something pretty similar some time ago (1992?) --- the performance
} hit was ghastly, so we removed it.

The something similar was to actually block and unblock the signals, which
meant two system calls on every operation; queue_signals() does nothing but
increment/decrement a counter unless a signal actually arrives.  

I definitely am not recommending blocking and unblocking signals here.
