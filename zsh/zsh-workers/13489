}         I just double checked on another machine with a local build
} dir and 07cond passes fine there.  But 55arguments fails with the
} local build dir on this other box as well (with the same output as in
} my previous message).

Is there anything in /etc/zshenv or /etc/zshrc that's the same on both
machines?  "make check" has the problem that it's vulnerable to being
messed with by the global rcfiles, and completion is the most exposed.
