Some characters have strange effects when typed at the shell prompt:

o-umlaut (0xf6 on my Linux box) deletes the last character typed,
A-umlaut (0xc4) terminates the shell immediately.

zsh-3.1.2 didn't have this bug.

Maybe this is fixed in zefram4, but unfortunately I lost a lot of my
saved mail and don't remember where to get it. Can anybody repost the
address, please?

Regards,
