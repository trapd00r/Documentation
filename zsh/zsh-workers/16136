Subject: 4.0.3
Date: Wed, 24 Oct 2001 18:30:31 +0100
Message-ID: <7336.1003944631@csr.com>
From: Peter Stephenson <pws@csr.com>

I am in the process of uploading 4.0.3 to the zsh site.  It takes a long
time because I always make several dozen mistakes, so if anybody's
forgotten to commit anything it's too late.  I haven't altered the links
yet or moved 4.0.2.  It would be useful if a few people could check that
this version works before I announce it elsewhere and upload it to
sourceforge.

The announcement will look something like:


Version 4.0.3 of zsh, the Z-Shell, has been released.  Zsh is an enhanced
UNIX shell related to sh and ksh.  This is a maintenance release of the
stable 4.0 series.  There are very few user-visible changes, mostly
minor enhancements to the completion function system.  Some configuration
and compilation issues have been addressed to improve compatibility with
AIX, MacOS X/Darwin, and QNX Neutrino.

Please send comments and bug reports to <zsh-workers@sunsite.dk>.

The META-FAQ, giving general information about availability of the shell,
is appended.

Peter Stephenson <coordinator@zsh.org>

META-FAQ for the Z Shell
------------------------

The latest version of this META-FAQ can be found at any of the FTP sites
listed below.

Author
------

Zsh was originally written by Paul Falstad <pf@zsh.org>.
Zsh is now maintained by the members of the zsh-workers mailing
list <zsh-workers@sunsite.dk>.  The development is currently
coordinated by Peter Stephenson <pws@zsh.org>.  The coordinator
can be contacted at <coordinator@zsh.org>, but matters relating to
the code should generally go to the mailing list.

Availability
------------

Zsh is available from the following anonymous FTP sites.  These mirror
sites are kept frequently up to date.  The sites marked with (H) may be

The mailing lists are archived; the archives can be accessed via the
administrative addresses listed above.  There is also a hypertext
archive, maintained by Geoff Wing <gcw@zsh.org>, available at
http://www.zsh.org/mla/.

The Zsh FAQ
-----------

Zsh has a list of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ), maintained by
Peter Stephenson <pws@zsh.org>.  It is regularly posted to the
newsgroup comp.unix.shell and the zsh-announce mailing list.
The latest version can be found at any of the Zsh FTP sites, or at
http://www.zsh.org/FAQ/.  The contact address for FAQ-related matters
is <faqmaster@zsh.org>.

The Zsh Web Page
----------------

Zsh has a web page which is located at http://www.zsh.org/.  This is
maintained by Karsten Thygesen <karthy@zsh.org>, of SunSITE Denmark.
The contact address for web-related matters is <webmaster@zsh.org>.

The Zsh Userguide
-----------------

A userguide is currently in preparation.  It is intended to complement the
manual, with explanations and hints on issues where the manual can be
cabbalistic, hierographic, or downright mystifying (for example, the word
`hierographic' does not exist).  It can be viewed in its current state at
http://zsh.sunsite.dk/Guide/.  At the time of writing, chapters
dealing with startup files and their contents and the new completion system
were essentially complete.
