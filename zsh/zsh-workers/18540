I wrote that comment.  The intent was as described, and I have a mental
image of the fallback functions being in an appropriate conditional
section.  I remember adding mechanism to the build process to make that
information available to the preprocessor.  If the fallback functions
are no longer conditionally compiled, it'll be an accidental change,
unless I got it wrong to start with.
