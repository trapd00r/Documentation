Is there any straightforward way to make completion work when you're
inside braces.  e.g. I'd like:


cp ~gjb/archive/{zsh.tgz,xterm[TAB]

to complete on 

~gjb/archive/xterm

I realize the general case can be complex, but still seems tractable.
Can one do this w/o changing zsh source?  Is it doable?

Thanks,
Greg
