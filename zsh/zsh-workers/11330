Thank you, Sven! It even works here with not-so-fast connection ... really
nice.

Now, if just compinstall supported it :-)

Oh, yes, and you did not comment on per-completion widget styles. Is it

usefully set differently for different completion widgets)? The only
thing I had in mind was listing - but you did it with this patch.
