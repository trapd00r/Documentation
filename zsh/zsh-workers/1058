mult is used by zle and contains the numeric argument of zle commands.  No
C standard says that mult is a reserved variable I think.  Unfortunately
libmp.so.1 seems to use it.  It should have used something like __mult to
protect user programs.  mult is a quite innocent variable name and this
would mean that every application defining mult as an external symbol will
fail even it it did work under Solaris 2.4.  This is a serious bug in
Solaris.  Please report it to SUN.  I'll rename mult to something else in
the next beta anyway.

Bye,

Zoltan
