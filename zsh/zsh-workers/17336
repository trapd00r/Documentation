This is good but I have a couple of observations:

If I do ls -<tab><tab><ctrl-s>exc, the prompt changes to `failing
isearch'. It is matching the word `except' and the `c' didn't enable it
to move on to another entry so it says it is failing but this doesn't
seem correct because it is still matching the word `except'. It should
only say failing when there really is nothing found.

Keeping with ls, if I do a search for `co' and then repeatedly press
Ctrl-S to cycle between the matching completions, I have to press Ctrl-S
twice to move off the --color option. Perhaps because `co' matches in
both the match and description.

The binding of backspace to undo is not ideal when cycling between
matches because it goes back through the matches before removing
characters off the end of the search string.

Before you commit this, the `m' in unambiguous is missing and the
sentence seems to have a word missing (inserting `for' between `matches'
and `the' would be one fix). I also think the `normally' should be
`normal' but I'm not certain on that.
