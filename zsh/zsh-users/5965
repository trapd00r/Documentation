    Hi Eric :)

 Eric Smith dixit:

    Won't work. Just type 'exit' (that way, with the quotes) and the
true 'exit', not the aliased one, will execute :((

    Better run 'disable exit'. You can always 'enable exit' again,
but... If you really need all that control, how about tweaking the
source code?. It's not very difficult and you get control over what
builtin commands are present and what not.

    Good luck :)
