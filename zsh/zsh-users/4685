When I go into the history the prompt begins at the beginning of the command
for example. 

$ [e]cho "test", instead of 
$ echo "test"[] 

I've even tried removing my .zshrc, .zshenv files and it still has the same
effect, and no other user accounts using zsh seem to be affected by this, any
help would be greatly appreciated.
