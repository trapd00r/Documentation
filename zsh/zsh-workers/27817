Testing the existence of $gitdir/{refname} seems a fine compromise.  
(Really, I don't see the issue; this seems like a drop in the bucket of 
_git's performance issues...  I s'pose the forks are prohibitively 
expensive on Win32?  Revised patch below anyway.)

Also, this breaks the fact that my previous patch fixed 'HEAD' *not* 
completing in a newly init'ed repo.  (The file .git/HEAD contains the 
text "ref: refs/heads/master", even if HEAD doesn't exist.)  But, 
whatever; speed trumps correctness.

(In case it's unclear, I prefer my previous patch -- doesn't _git fork 
all over the place? -- but either one's preferable to no-change or 
always-adding-them.)

Best,
Ben
