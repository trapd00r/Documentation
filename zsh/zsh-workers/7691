Subject: MH completion
Date: Tue, 07 Sep 1999 14:57:20 +0200
From: Peter Stephenson <pws@ifh.de>

I was trying to rewrite MH completion to use _arguments; you can run
`command -help' and make the argument list up from the output as you
go along.  But it looks like _arguments can't deal with the +folder
syntax, i.e. that anything beginning with a + needs to be completed
specially by a separate function/state.  Ideas?
