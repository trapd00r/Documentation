Thanks for spotting another one:  this was was because insertlastword()
wasn__t consistently remetafying the line if it returned in error.  I__ve
added another UMETACHECK() in the handler for the zle builtin so that
this sort of problem emerges a bit earlier.

I__ve already committed this because of problems with my ISP__s mail
server.
