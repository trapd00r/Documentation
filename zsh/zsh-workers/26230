Hi all,

it has been requested[1] that Debian introduces
/etc/zsh_completion.d similar to /etc/bash_completion.d

Pros:

* Package maintainers can introduce their own completions
   independent from upstream
* Users don't need to upgrade zsh in order to get new
   completions for new features in a package
* Completions for different versions of software can be used
   depending on what is actually installed

Cons:

* Upgrades might not make it back upstream
* Broken/stale completions might override Zsh's


What does everyone think of that? Personally, I can't
decide whether this is good or bad. It does have potential
in both directions.


Richard
