I am not sure if they necessarily benefit from them. I did not analyze
every article but at least some changes are related to code rearranging;
I guess most real bug fixes and new completion functions did go into
4.0.

Then please put current state of affairs into BUGS. It is bug after all.

I am not sure what do you mean. Several modules in one shared object?
This requires even more changes.

I see that nobody (me including) is happy with extra files and nobody is
going to undertake major rewrite :-) I do not have much spare time
currently, but I still hope to find some automatic way to replace all
variables with functions.
