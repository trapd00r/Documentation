I haven't used clone before this, but I can reproduce the behavior
described below.

clone doesn't even work any longer. For instance:

In the first terminal:

greux:~> exec zsh -f
greux% tty
/dev/pts/240
greux% foo=bar
greux% echo $foo
bar
greux% zmodload zsh/clone
greux% clone /dev/pts/241
greux% 

In the second terminal:

greux:~> exec zsh -f
greux% tty
/dev/pts/241
greux% clone: could not make /dev/pts/241 my controlling tty, job control disabled
greux% echo $foo

greux% 

(The message "clone: could not make..." appeared just after executing
"clone /dev/pts/241" in the first terminal.)
