} With the standard zip completion function (under zsh 4.0.2), when I type
} 
}   zip blah.zip file[TAB]
} 
} filename completion works, but when I type
} 
}   zip -r blah.zip file[TAB]
} 
} it doesn't work any longer. Does anyone have a better completion
} function for zip?

Hm.  Completion/Unix/Command/_zip thinks that -R is the option for
recursing into subdirectories, but zip 2.1 and 2.3 (as distributed
by RedHat) use -r, and 2.3 says -R is "PKZIP recursion."  Also, the
_zip function thinks `zip -e' will encrypt, but zip 2.3 doesn't have
that option on my system.

Oliver, it looks like you wrote the _zip function, posted in 13600.
On which version of zip did you base it?

Meanwhile, Vincent, as a temporary fix, edit _zip and replace -R with
-r in what should be the obvious place near the top of the function.
