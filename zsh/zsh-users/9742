OK, the first thing to try is:

  zstyle ':completion:*:expand:*' group-name ''

If that doesn't work, then it has to do with the way that you're binding
the _expand_word_and_keep function to a widget, because when I try it
(successfully) I consistently get a context of
    :completion:expand-word:expand:::
but your trace output shows a context of
    :completion::expand:::

Can you show me that part of your setup?
