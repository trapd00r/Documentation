I just spotted this ChangeLog entry:

+2008-02-07  Clint Adams  <clint@zsh.org>
+
+	* unposted: Functions/Misc/run-help-git,
+	Functions/Calendar/calendar_add, Functions/Misc/sticky-note: remove
+	shebang line.

Functions/Misc/sticky-note is explicitly designed to be runnable as a
standalone script.  Removing the #! line was IMO wrong.
