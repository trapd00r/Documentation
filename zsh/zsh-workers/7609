Subject: Calling a zsh script via telnet/inetd.

Hi,

I am new to this list, so apologies if this has been discussed before.
Please point me to the relevant article if that is the case.

Does anyone have an example of using zsh to control a telnet session
that they could publish here please ?

I'm trying to write a POP3 redirector, but am having a few problems
talking to the POP server when running my script under inetd or
tcpserver. If more details are needed, I will post. When I run my script
from the command line, it works fine.

Thanks for any help,

Regards,

Rich Aldridge,
