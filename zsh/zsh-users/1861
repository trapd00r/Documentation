Yes you are right, I'm using Xmodmap for xterm, but shouldn't the linux
console be ok?

Anyway I can trick the last one with "loadkeys" but I don't think that this
the best option.

If you rely on generating 8-bit sequences then if I would use a plain
terminal(of course I won't do that :-)) which is not able to generate 8-bit
chars what would happen? IMHO the best choice here is to make an option to
swap between the two types.

But still why \Cv \C\My gives me only an ESC ???
