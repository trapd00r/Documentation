I think what I really meant to say is that I think it should be  
consistent. I.e., it should either never do it, or always do it  
(perhaps through a setting/option).

At least in my case I had been using my own custom prompt function  
that used $HOME (the abbreviation code stolen from fish) and I noticed  
I could use print -P '%~' instead of doing the tilde replacement  
myself. However, after switching to that, I noticed what seemed to be  
the random behavior of using a named directory. After looking at zsh's  
source code I realized it was using a cache and I had been populating  
the cache in some cases without realizing it.

Anyway, regardless of that, is there a way to populate the cache when  
I load zsh, and is there a way to disable named directory expansion  
for %~? Though I suppose I could just as well use "${PWD/$HOME/~}" in  
the latter case.

(Also, sorry for sending this twice. I meant to reply to the list as  
well.)
