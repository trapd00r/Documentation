-keyrepeat and -nokeyrepeat takes a sequence of words.  The words is
sequence of:
1) a keycode represended as an integer (one word)
2) a keycode range represented as an integer, hyphen and an integer
(three words)

For example,

  xwit -nokeyrepeat 61 - 69 128 

disables autorepeat for keys `q', `w', `e', `r', `t', `y' and ` '. 
(On my keyboard, of course.)

The arguments for -keyrepeats is end before next option as:

  xwit -nokeyrepeat 61 - 69 128 -sync

So, '-keyrepeat:*[0-9]##:keycode: ' doesn't work because [0-9]##
matches to the first argument: `61'.

If _arguments have a form like `:*pattern:message:action' but the
pattern is matched against to a argument *next* to an arguments for
the option, we can use _arguments for _xwit.

Wow.  Thanks.

Hm.  I'll read changed tag stuff...

Since I found that `xwit -keyrepeat 10 -<TAB>' runs _message, it is
fixed as follows.
