    You can always "unsetopt prompt_cr", but I find this one much
more useful:

    # After you've set your PS1
    PS1=$'\n'"$PS1"

    This prints a newline before the prompt itself. You can achieve
this with precmd, too, you can make it print a newline if there is
text on the current line (I think you can know that in Linux using
/dev/vcs), or if the cursor is in the last column, etc. For me adding
a newline character just before my PS1 is enough.
