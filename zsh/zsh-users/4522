Subject: zsh 4.0.4 on HP-UX?
Message-ID: <227320000.1007755459@ohm.mmt.bellhowell.com>

I installed the 4.0.4 package from the HP-UX freeware site at 
http://hpux.cs.utah.edu onto a few HP-UX 11.0 boxes, and everything works:

except for the backspace key. It works, but the cursor doesn't go 
backwards.

which is somewhat unusual to me, since they have it fixed so it works in 
bash, but as soon as I go run zsh from inside the bash shell.. backspace 
ceases to display properly. This was both with and without having a 
zprofile/zshenv file. stty looks the exact same from both sides. I tried 
some other settings, to no avail.

For background info, TERM is either xterm (konsole, PuTTY, xterm) or 
xterm-color (Eterm). Here is stty -a output:


speed 300 baud; line = 0;
rows = 55; columns = 120
min = 4; time = 0;
intr = ^C; quit = ^\; erase = ^H; kill = ^U
eof = ^D; eol = ^@; eol2 <undef>; swtch <undef>
stop = ^S; start = ^Q; susp <undef>; dsusp <undef>

I have a feeling that i'm missing something very simple :)
