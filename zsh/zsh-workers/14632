I have no idea why you had this undefine.  In addition it's an
``impure'' macro name, i.e., you can only use this macro via defn, or
indir, but not as is.

To me it is useless (but I have not read your configure.in).  autoconf
thinks its useless too as it complains about undefining something not
defined.



I believe you, zsh people, should find some simplifications to your
configure.in.  In particular, note that you no longer have to perform
tricks to have AC_OUTPUT work on builddir/srcdir files, it's now
built in Autoconf.
