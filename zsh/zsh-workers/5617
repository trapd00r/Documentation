What about following: add new item to compstate, say, last_nmatches, that
hold count of matches added by the *last* used compgen, compadd, compcall.
That can be used to test if we got something, and probably may be useful for
other tasks as well. And definitely better

if [[ $compstate[last_nmatches] -gt 0 ]]

than current

save nmatches
call completion
compare
