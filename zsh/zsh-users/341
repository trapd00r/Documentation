I'm not, on Linux, but I've only been using pre6 since a few minutes ago.

Did you compile with debugging and zsh_mem and so forth?  To what previous
version are you comparing it (so we know what changes to re-examine)?

The only recent change that would have any conceivable effect on this is
that all references to the variable `columns' in display update code have
been replaced by the ternary expression `(columns < 1 ? 80 : columns)'.
But your compiler would have to be doing something really awful for that
to have any noticable effect.
