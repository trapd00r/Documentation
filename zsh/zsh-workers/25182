Note that in math, -(a * b) and (-a) * b are equivalent (even in
the general case of a ring), and I'd say that most people regard
- a * b more like -(a * b) than (-a) * b. So, you can't really
compare to * without confusion.

Also ** is merely a replacement for the more conventional (and
shorter) ^ when ^ can't be used (e.g. because it already has
another meaning).

Math writing asside, the fact that -3**2 and 0-3**2 return different
results is quite confusing too.
