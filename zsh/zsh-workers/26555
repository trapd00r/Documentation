First of all, sorry for the subject of the email. I wanted to change it
after I found out what the actual issue was but forgot. The body of the
mail changed quite substantially. Duh..

Very good point. I'll check against the docs that my terminology is
correct.

Hardly significant, agreed. But when reading docs, I go into pedantic
prick mode, looking for stuff to improve :p
Liberal in what you require, strict in what you provide and all that.

I'll see where that fits and work it into the patch.

No idea about appropriate (did not dig too deeply), but it _is_ used
without any checking of return values etc. Namely in

Src/builtin.c 540 & 541:

    dosetopt(VERBOSE, 0, 0);
    dosetopt(XTRACE, 0, 0);

All occurences in Src/init.c

Src/options.c 506:

static void
setoption(HashNode hn, int value)
{
    dosetopt(((Optname) hn)->optno, value, 0);
}

Agreed, but I didn't know it's too low when I wrote this (and I don't
think it's my place to decide those matters, anyway). That said, I
should have checked all places it is used in before suggesting direct
printing. Return values? Or passing back an actual string?
