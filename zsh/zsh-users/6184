Crapload of these today. While the filtering seemed to be working for a
while, I still think that closing the list to offlist subscribers and /
or requiring confirmation =E0 la TMDA for non-subscribers is a good
idea...

I know it's been said before, but I find that the spam and viruses I get
through this list almost exceed the useful information I get from it.
Most technical lists these days require subscription, and while this may
be problematic for some, I think the benefits outweigh the drawbacks.
