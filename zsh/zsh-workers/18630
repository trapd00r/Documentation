I also found another problem but this time only when I try to compile
32bit binary.

Compiler is Sun ONE Studio 8, Compiler Collection
            cc: Sun C 5.5 Patch 112760-01 2003/05/18 

cc -c -I. -D_LARGEFILE_SOURCE -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -xO4  -o compat.o compat.c
"compat.c", line 441: variable length array can not be declared with a static storage class: llbuf
cc: acomp failed for compat.c
