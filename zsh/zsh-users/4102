Can you be more precise? You want complete glob patterns but do not want
to see completion list? You do not want to see completion listing always
or only in case of completing patterns?

To switch listing off use setopt nolist and probably nomenu, noautomenu.
I guess you know it. To switch list off only for patterns you need to
use new completion and set styles something like ...

... Oops! I was about to say that you need to use

zstyle ':completion::match:*' list off

But I realized that listing is not controlled by style. How weird.
Actually, according to documentation, the

zstyle ':completion::match:*' menu off

must work but does not.

What's the difference?

Why do you want to do it "bash style" with zsh? E.g. using zsh it is
much better to do

ls /u/l/bTAB

and get it completed to /usr/local/bin. Easier, is not it?
