That is nice. But a couple more questions about typeset:

- how can I get the names of _scalar_ variables? (I can list integer variables
with typeset +i) In 3.1.5+ with parameter module it is not so interesting - but
for 3.0.6 it may still be useful.

- what does this mean (taken from Zsh typeset docs):

                                                             Using
     `+' rather than `-' to introduce the flag causes the attribute to
     be turned off, and suppresses printing of the names and values.

- the form ``typeset -i +'' (and like) is not documented at all.

- the format of simple ``typeset'' output is not documented as well. It was
great surprise to me once ...
