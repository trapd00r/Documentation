Subject: git-svn completion issue

% git-svn <tab>
---- no match for: `command'

I opened up _git to have a look, it seems it checks if $state is
command, then declares an array $commands, which it then goes ahead
and never uses for anything. I don't know exactly what incantation of
_arguments or similar needs to be done here so no patch this time.
