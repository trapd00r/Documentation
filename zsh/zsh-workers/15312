Sorry, I made a mistake in my exaple.  I meant:
         % ./setu<TAB>
Another, less useful, example world be:
         % /usr/local/bin/zs<TAB>

Cygwin already has some handling for exe files.  Try
         % ls -l /bin/ls
         % ls -l /bin/ls*
It would be nice if this were more complete, i.e. if all file handling 
functions would pretend there is a file "/bin/ls".  Then it would be less 
effort to port individual applications, right?

Perhaps, but that's not what I meant.  And your tip,
         zstyle ':completion::complete:-command-:*' ignored-patterns 
'*.(#i)(exe|dll)'
takes care of that anyway.
