Thanks!  that mostly works - good enough for my uses anyway.  
The difference now is that scan (and other MH tools) completions handle
subfolders fine, mutt doesn't. 

% scan +inb<tab>

completes to:

% scan +inbox/

and my cursor is immediately after the /.

% mutt -f +inb<tab>

completes to:

% mutt -f +inbox 

and my cursor is after the space (two characters after the x)  

as I said - good enough :)   I think I'll just leave my home machine
running 3.0.8 for now though, eventaully moving to the new version.
