To hopefully reduce  the pain of typing, I'm  thinking about switching
to a  DVORAK keyboard. I'm looking  into somehow making  this keyboard
available on the  command line for the variety of  terminals I work at
(e.g. VT100, xterm) while using zsh.

Anybody have any experience with this? Does it make the vi keybindings
awkward?

Thanks.
