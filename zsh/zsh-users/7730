Hi,

Is it possible to imitate tcsh's behavior with 'set autolist',
which, when TAB pressed just at the beginning of the command line,
prints list of files and directories in the current dir (zsh by default
just inserts plain TAB, which in my opinion is rather useless).
Zsh version 4.2.0.
   
Best regards,
     Igor.
