Subject: PATCH: test on Cygwin
Date: Mon, 21 May 2001 11:30:33 +0100
From: Peter Stephenson <pws@csr.com>

This works around a problem with the tests on my version of Cygwin (not the
most recent) where rm -rf hung on a file which didn't have write
permission (i.e. did have the read-only bit set).  It was a Samba-mounted
disk.

Andrej, have you seen this and do you know if it's fixed yet?

There are various other failures on my version of Cygwin:  part of the
problem is that the test suite doesn't yet handle skipping tests for known
unsupported features.
