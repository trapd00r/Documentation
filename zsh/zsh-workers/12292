} Why is this messing with your preferences?  It's only setting a
} default which each user can override, surely?

It's setting a default other than the documented one, which I should not
be required to override when the documented behavior is already as I
prefer it.

} Again, I must be missing something because I don't see why you
} describe this as messing with /your/ fpath when at that stage you (the
} user) haven't made any changes to it.

What?  You said this was in /etc/zshrc.  At that point I *HAVE* made
changes to it, in ~/.zshenv.  But even if I hadn't made any changes, who
are you to say that I *WANTED* any changes?

} You are still free to set it to whatever you want, aren't you?

Once again, I should be able to rely upon the documented defaults, not
be required to reassert them.

} The only possible problem I can

} be, but if you didn't want it autoloaded, you won't be using it
} anyway.

How do you know I won't be using it?  Somthing that you autoloaded may
have the same name as an external executable, which is now masked.  To
get the external executable back, I have to know to unfunction things
you autoloaded.  No, thank you.

Please err on the side of my sanity instead.

} I'm curious now.  Why?

Zefram has explained, if it wasn't already clear from my remarks above.

Further, who are you to decide that I don't want the first N-1 arguments
of cp and mv to be corrected, just because it would be wrong to correct
the Nth one?

} 
} Just another default, surely?

Just another not-the-documented-default.

Sigh.  This is exactly the reason that a whole bunch of default setopts
got turned on in 3.1 that used to be turned off in 3.0.  I still remain
unconvinced that it was a good idea, though I've largely given up on
complaining about it (except for the occasional pot-shot like this).

Bells and whistles are great when one understands what's happening.  One
is more likely to understand what's happening if one has to take some
kind of action to make it so.  Otherwise, the more things that happen,
the more confused one becomes.  For most instances of "one".

} Which is exactly what StartupFiles/RedHat/* would be, no?

Yes, which is exactly why they ought to have nothing in them that is not
absolutely essential to making every RedHat system work correctly.
