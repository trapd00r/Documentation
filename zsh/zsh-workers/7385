} Fine. This adds the (X) flag to turn on error-reporting. Both `e' and
} `E' were already taken, I could have used `w' or `W' for `warning' or 
} something like that, but that isn't really correct. Other free
} characters are: DGHJKTVWYZabcdghmnuwxyz -- any suggestions, or is `X'
} acceptable?

I think X is OK.  I keep hoping for csh's :x, though ...
