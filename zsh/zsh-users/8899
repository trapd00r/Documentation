You could try doing something with ignored-patterns and zstyle -e:

Does keeper just keep it's words in an array? If so something like
'(${(j.|.)~keptwords})' may be a start. You may also need to remove
$IPREFIX and $ISUFFIX from the beginning and end of each word in the
array. You would also have problems if you want to use other
ignore-patterns styles.
