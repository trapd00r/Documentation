This one seems really strange to me.  Why is $(foo) different from `foo`
in ksh?  I think I prefer zsh's behavior, even if it isn't compatible.

    $ echo $(echo '\$x')
    \$x
    $ echo `echo '\$x'`
    $x
    $

Look, ksh isn't even consistent about it!  Why should that $ cause a
magically different behavior?

    $ echo $(echo '\x')
    \x
    $ echo `echo '\x'`
    \x
    $

(This is ksh88, I believe, in case that matters.)
