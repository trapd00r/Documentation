Gladly, but that should probably wait a bit until we actually know what
should be done by which part. Does anyone else have any thoughts
about the relative merrits/disadvantages of enhancing XDG or don't
people care either way as long as there is a 'standardized' way to do
this?

Even though this looks kinda comical, wouldn't

  $XDG_DATA_HOME/$XDG_SESSION_SHELL_DIR/$XGD_SESSION_SHELL_ID

make more sense? I switched the position of SESSION and SHELL
on purpose, as this would faciliate future enhancement for session
state of other programs.
