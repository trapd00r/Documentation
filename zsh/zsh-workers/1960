} Is the broken-printable lossage *really* necessary?  It's a real
} nuisance when trying to apply patches.

I didn't get any lossage ... the problem appears to be that Zoltan
is sending out

Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

which isn't necessary (his message is all 7bit) but which causes "smart"
ESMTP agents to convert to quoted-printable when gatewaying to an old
SMTP (not 8-bit-clean) agent.

Zoltan didn't do the encoding; it happened along the way somewhere.
But Zoltan could have prevented it by using 7bit as his C-T-E, if he
has that level of control over his mail client.
