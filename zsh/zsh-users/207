   Sounds like you have a lazy sysadmin.

   I've been a sysadmin at the C17 project office since 1987, and I've never
   had a problem with zsh on either a Pyramid or a Sparc that was due to
   anything except my own keyboard carelessness.  As a matter of fact, zsh
   has kept me from deleting important stuff on more than one occasion.

   I tried bash and tcsh for about a year apiece and finally settled on zsh
   as having the best set of functions for interactive use.  This was a few
   years ago and I have no plans on changing to a different shell.
