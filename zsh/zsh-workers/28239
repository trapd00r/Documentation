} While I'm at it, this seems a natural extension.

I just tried this out, and got this:

schaefer<501> bindkey -lL
bindkey -N .safe
bindkey -N command
bindkey -N emacs
bindkey -N isearch
bindkey -N listscroll
bindkey -A emacs main
bindkey -N menuselect
bindkey -N vicmd
bindkey -N viins

Is it really correct to include "bindkey -N .safe" in that output?  If
I turn around and feed that back to the shell again, I get

schaefer<502> bindkey -N .safe
bindkey: keymap name `.safe' is protected

Perhaps the .safe keymap should be treated as invisible for this.
