Below is a one line patch to Src/Makefile.in fixing .SUFFIXES.

Since the next FAQ is coming soon I think that we have to change this line
in the FAQ:

In fact, zsh is currently the most powerful freely available shell.

This is undoubtedly a questionable statement.  Several other shells (es and
AT&T ksh'93) are very powerful with some features not present in zsh
(ksh'93 is not really free but it's almost free).  Every shell has its
strength.  I feel that it would be more correct to say that zsh is one of
the most powerful (freely available) shell.

I'm mentioning this since there was a short discussion about that in
comp.unix.shell after that last FAQ was posted and even if this
statement were true it may irritate a few people.
