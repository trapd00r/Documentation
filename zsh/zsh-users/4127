I've uploaded a new version of A User's Guide to the Z-Shell which you
can find at
  http://sunsite.dk/zsh/Guide/

The main addition is chapter 5, which talks about all forms of shell
substitutions and expansions.  Chapter 3 has been slightly edited.  I'd
be interested in any comments on either, of course.  It's possible
chapter 3 is a little indigestible and I could move some of the
marginalia to a later chapter or appendices or whatever.

There are now PDF versions.  These were created by pdflatex; I suspect
they are not as well compressed as you would get with Distiller, but
they are certainly smaller than the PostScript versions.
