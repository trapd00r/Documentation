Subject: RPM files of zsh-3.0.6-test-1
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Due to the deafening silence since I announced the 3.0.6-test-1 patch, I've
made up binary RPM distribtions of zsh-3.0.6-test-1 for i386 and put them
on ftp.brasslantern.com.  There are two:

	pub/zsh/redhat-5.1/zsh-3.0.6-test-1.i386.rpm
	pub/zsh/redhat-6.0/zsh-3.0.6-test_1.i386.rpm

The former is RPM v2.5 compatible and uses glibc 2.0, the latter requires
RPM v3.0 and uses glibc 2.1.  (Note that RPM v3 won't permit a hyphen in
the release field, so that file has an underscore instead.)

Note that upgrading to this package will remove RedHat's /etc/z* files, so
root may find that /sbin and /usr/sbin aren't in his path any more, and you
may see a different prompt format or find that magic-space is no longer
bound.  On the other hand, you won't have "bindkey -e" forced upon you.

Please report any problems you have.
