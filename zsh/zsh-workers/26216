Hi Vincent,

in your bug report[1] about zsh using the wrong kind of lock
in lockhistfile, you mentioned wanting to look into the
issue. Did you have time to do that? If not, could you do
a quick test to see if the issue is still open? I don't use NFS
currently, so there is no quick way for me to check.


Thanks,
Richard
