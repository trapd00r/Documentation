It'd be a pity to loose the X-Seq headers. I'll have another go at
getting through to Karsten. He was very helpful with some rsync problems
and web problems not so long ago.

Bouncing messages to the old sunsite.auc.dk domain would cut the number
of spams by more than half and if the bounce message points people to
the new address we wouldn't lose real messages.
