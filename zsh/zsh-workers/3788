Squiggle is an indispensable tool for preparing "viewer friendly"
CAD-generated designs and illustrations.

For a limited time, we are offering Squiggle for only $49.00 - a savings 
of over 50% off our regular price.

Squiggle enables you to create drawings that are more approachable,
allowing your clients to feel more comfortable with your design process.

Squiggle works with all the popular CAD programs, allowing you to 
transform HPGL and HPGL/2 plot files into hand-drawn art in
a matter of minutes.  Squiggle allows for the customization of variable
line combinations, and allows the user to vary the width and color of up to
255 lines with an unlimited number of hand drawn styles to each line.

You can choose from a range of seven preset styles that range from
"carefully sketched with a drafting pen" to "scribbled on the back of a
napkin."

Each line is drawn independently, and results are not precisely predictable-
just like drawing done by the human hand. Styles can be combined into one 
image and pen effects can be can be saved into templates to create custom,
"in-house" styles.
