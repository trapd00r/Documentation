nop.  just an assumption on my part.  Sorry 'bout that, didn't mean to

Sol 2.6 has the same problem, it *may* build the smaller test program along
the way to linking the final huge executable, but compiling and linking
fails on both OSs, eventually.
The errors that I get from the links are duplicate symbols in different
libraries that use the same part of the STL (i.e. duplicate vector
class,etc.).
