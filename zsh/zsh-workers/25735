As a side note: there's a scenario I have at $work where use-server
won't work but the simple case will: multiple P4 servers and the file
named by $P4CONFIG, in the root directory of the client, setting P4PORT
to the correct server.

I don't know of a way to deal with this for the use-server case, since
environment variables can't be auto-set by directory (although I could
use precmd() to mangle that in, just for this, I suppose).

So ...

Suggest adding before the "See comments[...]" sentence:

  Using the tt(P4CONFIG) method may function better in environments with
  multiple P4 servers where tt(P4PORT) is set in the file named by
  tt(P4CONFIG).
