}     That f*cking 'big@boss.com' is spamming me not thru zsh, as

The big@boss.com mail is a worm (virus), not a spam.  There's no single
point of origin from which it can be stopped.  If you can't have it
filtered out by your ISP or some such, you're just going to have to live
with it until it runs its course and dies off.
