As I understand it, it gives you additional flexibility. You can have a single
function that is linked to more than one widget. Widget name is available so
function can behave differently. Currently I have e.g. function

((${+NUMERIC})) || zle .set-local-history
if [[ $WIDGET == .* ]]
then
    zle $WIDGET
else
    zle .$WIDGET
fi
((${+NUMERIC})) || zle .set-local-history

and redefine all *history* widgets to use this function. Implementing the same
directly as function would depend on FUNCTIONARGZERO setting.
