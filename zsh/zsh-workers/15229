Does `study' mean something completely different in PCRE than in Perl?

In Perl, `study' means to examine the *string that is to be searched* to
increase the speed of matching.  It has no effect at all on the pattern
that was compiled.  Hence in Perl, a `study' at the point where zpgrep
calls `pcre_study' would be completely useless as no input has been read
yet.  (And calling `study' on every line would be a waste anyway.)

I really don't know, having never used PCRE except as a side-effect of PHP,
but if we're going to include this then the doc (and the zpgrep example)
ought to be correct.
