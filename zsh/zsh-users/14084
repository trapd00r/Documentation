Well, yes, "should become" and "already is" are two different things, yes?
:-)

There's been much discussion about doing this (rebase on install), but as
yet no decision to actually have it done.  There seems to be some
disagreement as to weither doing rebaseall is a proper solution to
something that's viewed as a per-package issue.  I personally view it as
a flay in Windows' architecture, but that's just me :-)
