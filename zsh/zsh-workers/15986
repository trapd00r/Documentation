It is certainly the most sensible behaviour so I agree that making it
default would be better.

How do we go about making styles like tag-order and file-patterns

Didn't we used to have a bunch of styles set by default from compinit? I
still have `zstyle -d' in my .zshrc which was there to remove them.
