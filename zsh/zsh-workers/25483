Hmm yes, but what if you want to type --no-abbrev -v in that order?

The man page and the command are both happy with -l -s. With recent git
versions, the -l option is always a no-op anyway... But in all honesty,
I think I just hadn't figured out what the (I) construction did then :).
It is still mystifying to me why _git-branch cares where on the command-line
the -v appears.

And also, it only checked if -v was present to complete --abbrev, but not
the other way around. Besides, isn't this what the (-v)--abbrev syntax
is for? (Though that has always confused me, reading in the manpage at least
suggests that's what it does, *fiddles with that a bit*.)
