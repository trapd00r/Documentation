A3.On what machines will it run?

     Note for Solaris 2.2 and 2.3: The UCB versions of the routines
     for reading directories are not usable (the struct definitions
     are incompatible with the ones assumed by zsh). The symptom of
     this is that globbed filenames in the compiled version of zsh
     will be missing the first two letters. To avoid this, make sure
     you compile zsh without any reference to /usr/ucblib in (e.g.)
     your LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

It shouldn't (I can verify it doesn't in Solaris-2.3 and Solaris-2.5;
if it does in Solaris-2.4, then perhaps there is a configure bug).
