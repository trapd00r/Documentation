Somebody mangled the patch on the way ... I should note that :-( But both
are looking absolutely identically ...

Note that the patch is looking for lines ending with the
two characters ^ A, but the file itself ends with the
single character Ctrl-A.  (This happens to be much
more visible in the quoted-printable that you happend
to mail than it would be in an editor which represents
Ctrl-A as a ^A pair.)
