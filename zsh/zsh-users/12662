I want to take the session history, i.e. what was typed since last login,
and edit that. Then, I want whatever I save to replace the session
history.

Histories of other shells or in files should not be affected in any way.

It is probably easiest to just put it into $EDITOR with the commands.
I am using EXTENDED_HISTORY, but I don't mind the information
in my Vim. If all else fails, blockwise select & remove :)
