    Curious. If I try that (but with a longer name length, since I
have a 100 col-wide terminal) I have exactly the same instead of the
usual infinite loop or crash. The screen just messes up.

    This looks like confirming that the bug (well, the infinite loop
and the crash) only happens when any element in the list has exactly
$COLUMNS characters, including not only the "real" characters but
any backslash that metafies any other char. Longer filenames doesn't
seem to have this effect, although I should better test...

    BTW, Clint, which version of zsh are you using?
