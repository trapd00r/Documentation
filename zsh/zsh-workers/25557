Sorting or not sorting is done by whether you pass the option "-J group"
or "-V group" to compadd.  In your case it looks like the right thing to
do is to pass the option "-V" (only) to _wanted, which will construct an
appropriate argument list for compadd.
Completion/Zsh/Type/_directory_stack was the simplest example I noticed
of this happening.
