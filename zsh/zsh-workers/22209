Hi Raúl ;),

I know. Libtool is quoting positional parameters which has
shell metacharacters in them. But it's no working because the
string is already split in that point. I've been looking at the
libtool script and i think the problem is in a 'for arg in' that
it's failing with zsh in doing the right splitting.

No, i've already tested that option.

I just wanted to know if there was some zsh option that solved
this problem...

Thanks,
