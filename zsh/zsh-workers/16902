zsh 4.0.4, glibc 2.2.4, i686, 2.4 linux kernel

Creating an alias and a function with the same name leads to recursion:

[teg@halden teg]$ zsh -
halden% alias xx='echo ALIAS'
halden% xx
ALIAS
halden% xx()
function> { echo FUNC }
halden% which xx
xx: aliased to echo ALIAS
halden% xx
Killed
[teg@halden teg]$

(at this point, the zsh process was 500 MB large...)
