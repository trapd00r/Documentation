    I'm afraid I didn't explained correctly O:)) I forgot to say that
the choice must be done *before* 'configure' is run if file editing
is involved, so it can be compiled on destination.

    But I suppose that if I include a copy of config.modules it won't
be overwritten by 'configure' (I think that config.modules has a
flag to achieve that...).

    Thanks a lot for your answer, anyway :)))
