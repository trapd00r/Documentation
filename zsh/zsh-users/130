(zsh 2.6 beta 9).

I've noticed that <> doesn't appear to order the expanded files in
numeric order.  Eg.  <> in a directory containing 1 2 4 9 24 will
expand as 1 2 24 4 9.  This isn't completely useful behavior.
The only workaround I've found is to use a succession of ? ?? ???, etc.

Renaming files is definitely not an option, I'm working with news
spool directories and mh folders.

Has this been fixed in a newer beta?
