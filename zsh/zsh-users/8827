I checked your zsh-templates Fink package some time ago. I think your 
extensions are very useful, but some scripts seem to be written by 
copying and modifying files from original zsh distribution. It is not 
efficient and I hope you can write your scripts by just calling 
original functions, although I've not looked at your code well and have 
no idea about that for now. :(
