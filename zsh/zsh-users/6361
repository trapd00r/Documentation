Hi,
sorry for this offtopic question but I know
that there are very knowledgeable people
on this list.

I had problems with the invocation script of
the opera web-browser.
The reason was that when invoked via

opera -remote openURL(...,...)

this script gets the TWO parameters
-remote
and
openURL(...,...)

and concatenates these to a SINGLE
parameter like
'-remote openURL(...,...)'
and passed this to the true opera
binary.

This didn't work ofcourse.

I replaced this with 'pushing' the 
arguments to the script onto an array
and expanded this when calling the true
binary.
Unfortunately ancient shells (like on Sun)
don't have arrays.
Does anybody know a means to achieve what
I intend such that it's running on ancient
shells?

Many thanks,
