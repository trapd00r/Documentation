Hm, haven't heard anything about this issue since.  Did it make it onto
the bug list?  I still find it pretty annoying that completion doesn't
work in these cases. :-(

I investigated a little more:
Here are cases where no slash is appended after hitting TAB:
cd bar/..
mv foo ..
mv foo ../bar/..
ls ..
ls ../bar/..

And here are cases where a slash is appended:
cd ..
cd ../bar/..
mv foo ../bar
ls ../bar

Thanks for any help,
 Andy.
