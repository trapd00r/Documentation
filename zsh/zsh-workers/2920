Yes.  zsh doesn't require gcc to build; it can be compiled by any ANSI
compiler.  It's very easy to accidentally write illegal code that gcc
won't even warn about normally.

Yes, we use variable length arrays if they are available.  That's a
special case.

We use quad types where they are available and needed.

Do you really believe all that GNU propaganda?  They seem to be
encouraging the creation of an "all the world's a GNU" syndrome.  The
truth is that there is no reason to use -pedantic if one only wants to
compile some code with gcc, and is not concerned about any other
compilers.  We *do* care about other compilers, so -pedantic is very
useful.
