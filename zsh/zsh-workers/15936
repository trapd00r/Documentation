Hi,

I've upgraded to 4.1.0-dev-1 and would like to make use of the new grouping
of long & short options in completion listings I saw discussed on this list
a while ago.

I've looked for the list-group style as mentioned in the original patch but
can't find it anywhere. Is this change included in 4.1.0-dev-1? If so, how
can I activate it? (This is actually the main reason I upgraded, so I'm
hoping it is!)

Cheers,

Martin.
