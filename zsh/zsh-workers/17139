No it's the (core of) _describe which is causing this exception. I'll
have a look. It was always (intended to be) the case that the list
contained the words in quoted form. I vaguely remember some discussion
about this and the argument for using quotes that this should make
clearer which parts in the list belong together and which are really
separate matches.

Though this is probably less of an issue in the cases where _describe
is used.
