I made a test release which can be found on
ftp://ftp.cs.elte.hu/pub/zsh/testing/zsh-2.6-beta20-test1.diff.gz

The size and date of the file:

  42154 Jun  3 03:46 /home/ftp/pub/zsh/zsh-2.6-beta20-test1.diff.gz

md5 checksum: c287d2aa41b6f9bb3cf267195c065bdb

This test release comes with a mostly rewritten execcmd().  Most of the
globbing is still done after fork() which should make those happy who would
like to background long globs.  Only the first argument is globbed before
fork.  -, command, exec and noglob are now builtins.  enable/disable works
for these and a shell function with the same name will override them.  The
builtin builtin is now handled in exec.c.  You can write
% builtin exec builtin noglob builtin command something
which is usually the same as `exec noglob command something'.

The option reorganization patch from Zefram is also included which should
not be noticable unless zsh is invoked as sh/ksh.

$0 is not set to the name of the script or function when executing a
sourced script or a shell function if zsh is invoked as sh or ksh.

I added -DDEBUG to the default CFLAGS to catch possible bugs.

New DPUTS(X,Y) macro for debugging: print Y if X is true.  DPUTS expands to
nothing is DEBUG is not defined.

Zoltan
