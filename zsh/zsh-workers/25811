Hi,

With the current debian zsh-beta, I see:

~$ cd
_init_d:17: no such file or directory: /etc/init.d/cd
~$ cd st                                                                                                                                  16:28
start  stop

for every command I try completion with. It seems to be down to
line 26 in _dispatch and this:

~$ zsh -f
% typeset -A a; a=('*/(init|rc[0-9S]#).d/*' _init_d 'zf*' _zftp)
% echo ${(@)a[(K)asdad]}
_init_d
% echo $ZSH_VERSION
4.3.6-dev-0+0929
%
