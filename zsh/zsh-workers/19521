It seems to be falling over on the sigmsg(...) macros.

You should have a file in the Src directory where you are building
called sigcount.h containing something like

#define SIGCOUNT	45
#define sigmsg(sig) ((sig) <= SIGCOUNT ? sig_msg[sig] : "unknown signal")

Is your version similar?  If so, is there something weird in the file
signames.c in the same directory (feel free to send to the file)?

Thanks for the info.
