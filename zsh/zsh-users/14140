I've uploaded 4.3.9-dev-5.

ftp://ftp.zsh.org:/pub/development/zsh-4.3.9-dev-5-doc.tar.bz2
ftp://ftp.zsh.org:/pub/development/zsh-4.3.9-dev-5-doc.tar.gz
ftp://ftp.zsh.org:/pub/development/zsh-4.3.9-dev-5.tar.bz2
ftp://ftp.zsh.org:/pub/development/zsh-4.3.9-dev-5.tar.gz

This has some configuration tweaking for HP-UX, a few bug fixes, some
completion function changes, and a more configurable version of
the PROMPT_CR option using the PROMPT_EOL_MARK variable.  When the
configuration problems stop coming I will release 4.3.10.

(4.3.9-dev-4 appeared briefly yesterday but wasn't quite up to date and
has now disappeared again.)
