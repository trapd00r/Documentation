} Is there something like expand-completions or similar?

Do you already have _expand in your completers style?

If so, my only other suggestion would be to try setopt nocaseglob.  I
suspect that you have a lower-case to upper-case matcher-list style
that is producing the mixed-case completions in the second example.
