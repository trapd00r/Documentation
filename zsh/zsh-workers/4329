To be fair, I only tested 3.1.4 far enough to see that the $LANG
problem wasn't fixed, then didn't install it.  I'm running 3.1.3
(patched for the $LANG problem) as $SHELL and 3.1.2 as /bin/sh.

O.K.

Right.  I later recalled having older binaries laying around and found
2.6-beta20 exhibited the same behavior.

I didn't know that.  O.K.

I didn't intend any criticism of the One True Shell, or of its
developers.  You've created a remarkable program I can't live
without and I'm only trying to help.
