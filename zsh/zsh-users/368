Yes, I think this is a feature, not a bug.  You should say
"path=($path)" if you want to keep path as an array.  Perhaps arrayness
should be more first-class than this, to be intuitive (so to get rid of
arrayness you'd type 'path="$path"' or something), but the current
behaviour doesn't seem too bad, IMHO.
