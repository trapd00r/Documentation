This seems to have done the trick, it's always nice when fixing something
makes it work too. The only funny thing I've noticed in the past 5 minutes
is that if i type a''''<tab> i get the file as a\'foobar, but if i
leave out the a and
just tab the four quotes, i get it in the command line as 'a''foobar' which
seems weird, but maybe the _correct (i think?) completer does things
differently. This is not something that bothers me in the least, just thought
i should mention it.
