    Hi Felix :)

    Is any of them interesting? Bash is a quite good shell (I've been
using it for years until I discovered Zsh), but all new features of
Bash have been in zsh for a (long?) time.

    Good. I prefer the usual behaviour, because that way you can
'hid' any error value in a pipeline if you want. But it can be a good
option to have if you do a lot of scripting involving long pipelines
whose last commands can be successful thus hiding errors.

    That's nice :))

    Thanks for pointing. Is good to see that Bash is getting better.
Is good to see that any free software goes better :)
