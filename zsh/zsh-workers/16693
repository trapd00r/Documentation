Yes, I know... please remember how menu selection came into existence,
it started as a hack, actually. I can see a solution and maybe I'll
even try to write it -- being stuck on the other things I'm thinking
about.

Hm. I'll try to look out for this.

In which way do you want this to differ from what beggining-of-history
and end-of-history do in menu selection? To the first/last line of the
currently visibla part of the list? Shouldn't be too hard to implement.

Yes, I've been dreaming of this, too. Tricky. Especially when trying
not to re-implement everything.
