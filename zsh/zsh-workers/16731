Are these the currently agreed definitions?  If so, they can be added to
Functions/Zle and the zshcontrib manual page.


function up-line-or-beginning-search {
    if [[ $LASTWIDGET != $WIDGET ]]
    then
        if [[ $LBUFFER == *$'\n'* ]]
        then
            __last_up_line=up-line-or-history
        else
            __last_up_line=history-beginning-search-backward
        fi
    fi
    zle .${__last_up_line:-beep}
}

function down-line-or-beginning-search {
    if [[ $LASTWIDGET != $WIDGET ]]
    then
        if [[ $LBUFFER == *$'\n'* ]]
        then
            __last_down_line=down-line-or-history
        else
            __last_down_line=history-beginning-search-forward
