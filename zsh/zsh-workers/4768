Sorry, it's only a bit of it too, namely the manual entry.  I deleted
that from various versions of the patches, but not the final one, so
ideally you should remove this before patching --- all except the very
top of Doc/Zsh/mod_stat.yo which simply changes the linked texinfo
nodes.  I'll try and get a patched version ready this afternoon MET
(this time I'll modify the version number, unless anyone thinks I
shouldn't).
