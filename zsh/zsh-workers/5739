Subject: Problem with variable expansion.

I have been happily following the current pws patch
distributions. However, with zsh-3.1.5-pws-11 variable expansion has
begun to fail. Sorry if this has already been mentioned. But I used to 
be able to do:

prompt> echo $Z[tab] 

and I would get options for either ZSH_NAME or ZSH_VERSION however,
now it attempts to do pathname completion. I am running linux RedHat 5.2
with kernel 2.2.0-pre8 if it matters. 

Thanks,  

  Kevin Sullivan
