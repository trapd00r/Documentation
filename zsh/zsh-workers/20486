I followed the thread on the zsh-workers mailing list, but
I not subscribed the zsh-workers mailing list, hence I mail this to you.

I tested the "fixed" zsh-cvs version. The  ^@^@^@ are gone now, but I cant
use tab anymore when in interactive mode. 
ls <tab> <tab> <tab> to cycle through the menu or ls .* <tab> <tab> don't
work.

Same config.

BTW: woody has 4.0.4 with menu completion, and in woody with 4.04 its
works fine. Sorry for this fault. The "woody" system I checked to
figure out the zsh version, had a patched zsh-4.0.7 installed.
But on every other woody system I use, is it the original uptodate
woody zsh-4.0.4 and its working fine for me.


Thanks and regards 
rene
