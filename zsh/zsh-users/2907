The failure may have different reasons. How is anyone here supposed to
know what's going on? :-)
Possible reasons for failure:
- postfix didn't shutdown properly, still occupying the smtp port
- postfix didn't shutdown properly, having a pid-file still laying
  around
- your /etc/rc.d/init.d/postfix has a bug
- a zsh bug, as you suggest
- [many more reasons for failure may arise]

CU,
Thomas
