I have no enthusiasm for tracking the trendiest source code management
system.  I've got enough real problems without inventing them.  CVS does
the fairly limited stuff we actually need for committing code and the
git mirror provides git junkies with access.

I'm not interested in hearing how great anyone's favourite system is,
either, I'm afraid.
