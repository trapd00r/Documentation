} 
} That doesn't seem to be bound on my system - nothing happens.  

Hmm, odd.  "compinit" should be picking it up, it has a #compdef line.

} I bound it manually (bindkey '^X?' _complete_debug) and get a ton of
} output - I'll attach it to this message.  there is no _mh_cache in 
} there at all.

There is this, though:

+_mailboxes:6> ((  ! 1  ))

That's `if (( ! $+_mailbox_cache )) then' in _mailboxes.  So your zsh
thinks it has already cached all the mailboxes it needs to know about.
There probably should be some other way to force _mailboxes to reload
the cache besides:

unset _mailbox_cache

and then try C-x ? again.
