The arithmetic documentation isn't explicit about the return status of
"let" and (( ... )); it's just hinted at in the example.  The
description of the "let" builtin is explicit, but you probably wouldn't
look there for documentation on (( ... )) having found the description
in the Arithmetic Evaluation section (and who uses the "let" builtin
anyway?)
