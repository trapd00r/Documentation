One thing you might look at is the LASTSEARCH zle parameter.

I think there is some funkiness with the incremental search widgets like
history-incremental-search-backward widget that you might have to be careful
about.  I had an opposite request, take text I typed on the command line and
make it go into the search buffer.  Bart provided a very helpful solution in a
thread around zsh-users/3991 (http://www.zsh.org/mla/users/2001/msg00401.html).
