as i understand the documentation, this should either return 0 or !0 
depending on whether a command "foo" can be found in the path:
 	[[ -x =foo ]]

but if =foo can't be found, it craps out.

i've got this in my ~/.zshrc:
 	[[ -x =most ]] && export PAGER=most

and i would expect that if "most" isn't in my path, nothing would happen 
(nothing, in this case, meaning the PAGER variable remains unset)... 
instead what actually happens that processing of ~/.zshrc dies with an 
error. not good!

so....
a) should that work the way i'm doing it?
b) if not, what's the correct way to test if a command exists in the PATH?


as documented in zshmisc....

     -x file
         true if file exists and is executable by current process.  If file 
exists and is a directory, then the current process has permission to 
search in the directory.

...

Normal shell expansion is performed on the file, string and pattern 
arguments...
