I thought about this when I changed it, and came to the conclusion that the
new behaviour was a simple matter of consistency with patterns.  *
guarantees to match anything at all, so 123potato is bound to match <1-2>*.
I don't think it's an option to make * not match numbers in this one case.
You probably don't need to be told all the workarounds; I suppose the
simplest is <1-2>[^0-9]*.
