I've uploaded 4.3.4 with fixes for the problems noted in 4.3.3 (thanks for
the responses).

(add-zsh-hook was in the 4.3.3 tar file but not in CVS, since I forgot to
commit it, so the difference there is in the archive but not the
distribution itself.  I still need to document this in the zshcontrib
manual.)
