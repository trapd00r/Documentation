There are programs/scripts that will generate the
words to "99 bottles of beer on the wall" in many
different languages.  Since there was a version for
sh and 2 versions for csh, I decided we needed to
submit one for zsh.  This is what I came up with.
Unfortunately it doesn't use any cool features of
zsh.

Any suggestions for improvement?

  if (($1 == 0)) then

  elif (($1 == 1)) then

  else
    bottles="$1 bottles of beer"
  fi
  print -n $bottles$2
}

integer i=100

while((i > 0))
do
  printbottles $i " on the wall, "
  printbottles $i ".\n"
  ((i--))
  print -n "Take one down, pass it around, "
  printbottles $i " on the wall.\n"
done
