Then your doc is out-of-date. At least mine says `:complete::dvips::-o-1'
and that ever since I made the command name be surrounded by double
colons, as you observed looking at the output of _complete_help:

That's right. The double colons are *only* used around command names,
to make it very easy to unambiguously match it. See 8777 for further
enlightenment (and the up-to-date version of the docs, where I
mentioned this explicitly).
