} We had a case of very strange core dumps here:
} I compiled 3.0.2 with gcc 2.7.2 on a SUN Sparc10(sun4m) SunOS 4.1.3.
} This SUN exports all its Filesystems (except the root) to another
} 'sun4m' with a slightly different CPU (faster, more cache on chip).
} 
} On this 'second' machine contrary to the identical setup and type of
} machine this zsh coredumps during it's startup!
} 
} .................................................................
} Well, now I UN-Optimized 'mem.c', and (so far) the error was gone

Sounds like incompatible versions of dynamically-loaded libc, to me.
Are you sure that all the .so that zsh is loading are the same version
on both machines?
