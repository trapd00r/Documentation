Could my whole .zshrc be of any help?

    625 .zshrc

Perhaps it's only triggered by one of my settings?

Well, as zsh dumped core in /scratch2/mp3 while completing, it was
either "cd" completing directory names or "mpg123" completing file and
directory names, can't say for sure now.

But I think zsh also crashed for other things (hostname completion for
ssh or something)... Can't really say for sure at the moment.
