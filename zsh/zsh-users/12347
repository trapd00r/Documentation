people on the list like to use the lowercased non-delimited form of
setopts, but the manpage referes to them in caps and with underscores. 
So it would be under INTERACTIVE_COMMENTS, but you might not have found

       INTERACTIVE_COMMENTS (-k) <K> <S>
              Allow comments even in interactive shells.
