} Because (as it said above), there are too many matches to display
} them. I was aware of this when I wrote that code but didn't know what
} to do - -so I just made it give up. But what do you think, it should
} do? It *can't* display the menu in this case... Should we disallow
} a-a-i-n-h in this case? I think this would be even weirder.

How about this:  Drop back into regular menu completion and produce the
"do you wish to see ...?" prompt.
