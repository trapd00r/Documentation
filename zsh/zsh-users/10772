 "Multiline Anonymous Literal Strings" (Sep 28,  1:51pm)

} Anyone know of a way to compose a long literal string without doing

The following requires "setopt multios" (which is the default, but a
few people turn it off):

alias mycommand=${(j: :)"${(f)$(<<<'print this is one string'
# This is a comment, but you cannot use unbalanced quotes in it
<<<'this is a more "     " spacey "     " string'
<<<'this is a third string')}"}

I believe it to be a parsing bug that the comment is not treated as
a comment until the command substution is executed, rather than when
it is "compiled", but it's the closest approximation to what you want
that you're going to find.

} In C, contiguous quoted strings are implicitly joined at a compile time

You darned young whippersnappers and your fancy-ANSI programming!  In
my day you ate your backslashes with your K&R, and liked them.
 
} In Perl and other languages, concatenation operators like ., &, and +
} are available.

And your point is?

The syntax of the shell language (which is only implemented by zsh, not
defined by it) precludes the use of infix operators.
