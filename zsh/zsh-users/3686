Subject: cannot find termcap info for xterm-color

I've been using xterm-color for quite awhile with
bash and tcsh, but when I try to set my TERM to
xterm-color under zsh, I get the error:

/u/jeff/.zshrc: can't find termcap info for xterm-color [90]

and my terminal doesn't work properly. The info
for the terminal is located under /usr/share/terminfo/x
so how can I get zsh to find it and use it?
