No, that's all done after the line manager has exited.  It's a nuisance the
line doesn't appear in the history (or anywhere else), but it's an entirely
different problem.  Could save the last successfully edited line (whatever
happens to it later) in yet another variable...  Oh, actually, you can do
that yourself...  The following seems to handle both cases.  It would be
more logical to unset ZLE_LINE_ABORTED in zle-line-init.  This works for
the spelling correction part even without the last patch.

zle-line-finish() {
   typeset -g ZLE_LINE_EDITED=3D$BUFFER
   # This is only called on a successful exit, so we don't need
   # the last aborted line any more...
   unset ZLE_LINE_ABORTED
}
recover-line() {
   if [[ -n $ZLE_LINE_ABORTED ]]; then
     LBUFFER=3D$ZLE_LINE_ABORTED
     RBUFFER=3D
   elif [[ -n $ZLE_LINE_EDITED ]]; then
     LBUFFER=3D$ZLE_LINE_EDITED
     RBUFFER=3D
   fi
}
zle -N zle-line-finish
zle -N recover-line
