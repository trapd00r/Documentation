I've recently upgraded from SunOS 4.1.3U1 and zsh 3.0.2 to Solaris 2.6
and zsh 3.0.5. However I've encountered a problem were occasionally the
xterm I'm working in just disappears.

I think zsh is exiting causing the xterm to exit too.

I can't replicate the problem as it seems to happen unpredictably when
I'm using zle. A message fleetingly appears but I never have time to read it.

Has anyone encounterd a similar problem? Does anyone know how I can
trap the message and read it before the xterm vanishes?
