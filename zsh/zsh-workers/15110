} Any real reasons to retain current zsh exaustive path search?

Aside from the fact that I happen to find that behavior useful, one of
the reasons that zsh works that way is because it's presumably more
efficient to simply let the kernel decide whether it can execve() any
given path than it is for the shell to stat() it first; no need to
waste time copying all that inode data into user space, etc.

} It depends on the definition of "appropriate execution permissions".
} It may be understood as "if file can be executed" (what zsh does
} currently). But I suspect, that it actually meant "stat.st_mode &
} (S_IXUSR|S_IXGRP|S_IXOTHR)". I.e. file with any executable bit set.

Or it may mean a file with execute bits set such that it's executable
by the current user.  Is there no way to tell?

I think the question should always be "Any real reason to change the
current behavior?"  So far I think not.
