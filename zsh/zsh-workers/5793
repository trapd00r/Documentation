This works for me. Thanks.

The only problem is, we have to set CLOBBERS_TYPEAHED. Last time I checked
it was set for me :-), Ultrix and something else - but definitely not for
Irix. So, either we have different problem on Irix, or Irix should set
CLOBBERS_TYPEAHED.

Thinking about it: writing general configure test requires spawning a child
connected to pty. Unforunately, there are too many ways to create a pty to
make such test useful.

Another approach is to simply always use FIONREAD if available. What is the
point of setting magical CLOBBERS_TYPEAHEAD at all?
