Irix 5.3 is known to work, with or without gcc.  Sometimes if the gcc
setup is bad configure can be confused into thinking it's
cross-compiling.  If you can remove gcc from your path and let
configure use the native cc it might work or give some indication of
what's happening.

Note to zsh-workers: shouldn't there ideally be a --[no]with-gcc
option to configure?  Some GNU software has this.  It's not always
right to assume people prefer building with gcc.
