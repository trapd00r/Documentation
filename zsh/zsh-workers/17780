} So, if I grasp the concept correctly, one could do something like
} 
} db.get() { .sh.value=$(db_get thisdb "$.sh.subscript"); }

Yes, except that, like e.g. the stat module's -A and -H options, I was
thinking that the name of the parameter to which to assign would be an
argument to the db_get function so that the $(...) would not be needed.

Either that, or db_get would always assign to .sh.value and would thus
only be callable from a discipline function.

} I think he's trying to say that var[5]=xyz would call $(f 5 xyz).

Ah.
