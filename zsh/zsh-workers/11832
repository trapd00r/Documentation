Hm, do you want it to ever expand tildes at all? We could add more
fine-grained control over the kinds of substitutions tried.

Yes, that was always the problem with expansion -- guessing if the
user wants it or not. Hm, maybe some kind of expand-ambiguous style.

Does anyone have other ideas for conditions when to expand or not?
