In the latest CVS sources, the following sequence will crash the
shell:

ls /usr/local/bin/<TAB>
zsh: do you wish to see all 522 possibilities (261 lines)? n

Now it doesn't matter what I answer; zsh goes away.  Apparently, no
core file is produced.  It also appears that yesterday's build did not
crash.
