I already wrote about this: when on PS2 up-line-or-history moves to previous
history event instead of previous line of current event. It just occured to me,
that something like

if we-are-on-PS2
  zle .push-line-or-edit
zle .up-line-or-history

would do quite nicely ... but how can I find out (in user defined widget) that I
am on PS2? The info is available (push-line-or-edit has it) - is it possible to
make it available to user widgets as well?
