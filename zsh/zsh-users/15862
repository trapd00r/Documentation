I'm not sure I understand the question, but the way it would is each
hook function is passed the same arguments in turn.  If it's not in a
form it recognises, it returns a non-zero status.  This continues until
one function handles the argument and returns a zero status.  So each
function just looks at the pattern it's got and sees if it thinks it
makes sense to handle it.  That requires a minimal amount of cooperation
but in the name -> directory direction it's simply a question of failing
gracefully with unmatched names.  In the other direction there's more of
an ordering problem --- do you want the name to pop up as a relative
directory like '.dir', or using some kind of absolute naming scheme?
But that's up to the user's preference.
