I have uploaded zsh 4.0.8 to the main FTP site at ftp.zsh.org.  I will
upload it to Sourceforge, too, once it becomes clear there are no
major problems.

Most of the changes are bug fixes.  There are some local improvements
to various completion functions too.  (The last bug fix for arithmetic
from Oliver just crept in.  It was not in the first version I uploaded
yesterday but didn't announce.  If you are downloading from a mirror, it
would be wise to wait until the timestamps catch up.)

This is likely to be the last 4.0 release.  After 4.1.2, there will be
a 4.2.0 as the 4.1 line looks stable.

Thanks to everyone who contributed, in particular Oliver who did a large
chunk of the work to copy bugs from the main line.
