We just had this discussion at great length.  Too bad the HTTP mailing list
archive is down right now.  When it comes back, I hope somebody can send a
message to zsh-announce to let people know.

Aside from the reasons why ${${E}} doesn't do what you expect, which I'm
reluctant to repeat again, the absolutely shortest answer is to use

	${(e)E:+\$$E}

I should have thought of this one the last time this came up; it does mean
exactly what ${${E}} only looks like it means.

This works in every version of zsh that supports the (e) flag, AFAIK.  Hey,
Peter: FAQ item?

If you happen to have built the latest development version of zsh with all
the patches that have appeared in the last six days, ${(P)E} is the same.
