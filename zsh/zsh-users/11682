That is not an issue, having the same string on the title bar anf the tab is 
good. 
The problem is that string increases ita length by doubling the current 
directory name and adding 'Konsole', after the vim session has been closed.
Thank you for having written the original script, anyway. 

I have tried to change titles by the command 
   print -nP -u2 '\033]0;\a'  

as Andrey Borzenkov suggested, yet closing the vim session yields the same 
result.
