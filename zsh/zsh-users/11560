i also often use nested variable expansions, extendedglobs, and other 
zsh only features: as zsh is far better than other shells, i don't carre 
about compatibility!

So i use alternative zsh syntax and Darwin will do the rest ;)

yet another syntax ... but lot of us have braces habbits (from C, java, 
javascript, perl, ...)

sure ... but stone age syntax remind me pascal ;)

is there a good reason to depreciate?

have you tried the alternative syntax? it feels more natural to me to 
write code with this one so i think that never had to learn it.

I understand your point of view and you're free to use stone age syntax 
  but i just think that the modern syntax would *not* be deprecated.
