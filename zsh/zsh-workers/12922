That -is- the way it's parsed.  It works just fine to write it that way.

The nice thing would be if there were a way to wait for those jobs to
complete.  They run in the background (as they must, really) but they're
not entered into the job table.

BTW, it's fairly easy to get zsh to forget to delete a file created with
=(...).  Compare:

	cat <<<'bar' =(echo foo)		# temp file removed
	echo bar >> =(echo foo)			# temp file removed
	cat <<<'bar' >> =(echo foo)		# temp file remains
