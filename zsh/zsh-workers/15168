} Listing completions for 'ls' uses more lines because it formats using
} one less column.
} 
} Mainly just curious why there is a difference.

Because zsh isn't ls.  Zsh doesn't invoke ls to generate the completion
listing, it uses its own filename-generation (globbing) routines and
computes the columns itself.

Try `setopt list_packed'.  If that doesn't make a difference, then there
may be something wrong with the "packing" code that we need to look at.
