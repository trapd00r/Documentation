(I've moved this onto zsh-users.)

Many thanks for all the work...  it's been about two years since the last
release, so it's a huge task even without disk failures etc.

I've uploaded

ftp://ftp.zsh.org/pub/development/zsh-4.2.6-dev-1.tar.gz

for anyone tracking the current stable branch to try out.  Since I suspect
people using that branch really just want a straighforward upgrade I'll
probably turn it into 4.2.7 within the next few days.

Realistically, anything left will probably have to wait for 4.4.
