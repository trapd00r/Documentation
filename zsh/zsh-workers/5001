Fine, really fine... all the zsh mail went to the `misc' folder.

Could anyone tell me (preferrably the list maintainer) what header I
can rely on for filtering?  And I mean *Header*... zsh-workers is
simply not enough (this should be obvious).

I *think*

  Delivered-To: mailing list zsh-workers@sunsite.auc.dk

is unique, but I'd like to be sure (for once).

Bye, J

PS: The old mailing list had a reliable

  ("^X-Mailing-List: <zsh-\\(workers\\|users\\|announce\\)@" . "zsh")

as a filter rule (no, this is not procmail... it's homegrown ;-) and
unreleased... and far from finished).
