Hi,

This fixes the suffix handling for completion of svn repository urls;
space is added as a suffix for files and '/' for directories, and the
-q flag is added for automatic suffix removal.

I can't say I 100% understand this code, but adding the suffix args
does seem to work correctly.  If someone could explain to me why
'[[ -n $suf ]] &&' is used before the compadd line for the files, but
the compadd for the directories is unqualified, I'd certainly
appreciate having a better understanding.. there are a couple more svn
completion problems I'm hoping to fix.

thanks,
Greg
