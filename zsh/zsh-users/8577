Hi,

 I checked the zshall manpage, but I fear to have overlocked the
 specific line which explains, for what I am using for.

 I want to limit the expand function (that one called when pressing
 TAB after entering for example "cd") to file of the current working
 directory or in other words I want to switch off the global search for
 expansion possibilities...

 How can I achieve this?

 Thank you very much for any help and hints in advance ! :)
 Keep zsh'ing! ;)
 Meino
