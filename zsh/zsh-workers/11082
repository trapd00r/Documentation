I'm seeing a couple test failures.

This is new and might be related to 11058:
*** /tmp/zsh.ztst.out.9344      Tue May  2 10:13:26 2000
--- /tmp/zsh.ztst.tout.9344     Tue May  2 10:13:27 2000
***************
*** 1,2 ****
  line: {tst a }{}
- MESSAGE:{no more arguments}
--- 1 ----
Test ./53completion.ztst failed: output differs from expected as shown above
for:
 comptest -c "$code" $'tst a \t'
Was testing: _arguments
./53completion.ztst: test failed.


The following failure has been around since the test was added April 19th.

*** /tmp/zsh.ztst.out.8907      Tue May  2 10:13:07 2000

Test ./13parameter.ztst failed: output differs from expected as shown above
for:

  # I think this is a bug.
  foo=(I could be watching that programme I recorded)
  print ${(o)foo}
  print ${(oi)foo}
  print ${(O)foo}
  print ${(Oi)foo}
Was testing: ${(o)...}, ${(O)...}
./13parameter.ztst: test failed.


I'm building on Solaris 2.6 with gcc 2.8.1 and static libraries.  Though my
guess is that these might generic bugs or related to environment issues. 
Though
I haven't investigated.
