I cannot reproduce it. I tried to add the same lines

alias foo='echo xxx'
bar() { foo }

to both ~/.zshenv and ~/.zshrc. In both cases it works as expected.
Sourcing file with the above defintions from .zshrc works as well. This
is with current CVS version.

Well, unfortunately, to be able to reply to list I have to use "Reply to
all" ... and manually removing recipients every time ...

It is exactly the reason I have procmail recipe that removes duplicates
