The !# substitution, which shuffles words from the current command line,
has always been a bit flaky in zsh, but now it seems to be broken entirely.

zagzig% echo foo bar !#:1
zsh: no words available from current command

(It should have echoed "foo bar foo".)

I'm not sure when this broke, but it was sometime before beta15-hzoli14.

I suspect it's related to the behavior of "fc" in the "fed" function that
was posted here a few days ago, because they both want the "current"
history event, which in some sense hasn't happened yet.
