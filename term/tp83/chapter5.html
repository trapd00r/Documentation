<H1 CLASS="chapterhead">VT100 Family of Video Terminals</H1>
<H2>Overview</H2>
<P>Digital's VT100 video terminal, introduced in 1978, has set industry standards for
functionality and reliability. The success of the VT100 led to the development of a
"family" of video terminals &#8211; the VT101, the VT102, the VT125, and the VT131.
Each of these terminals offers all the features found in your VT100.</P>
<P>VT100, VT101, VT102, VT125, and VT131, terminals can be used with any of
Digital's processors &#8211; PDP-8s, MICRO/PDP-11s, PDP-11s, VAXes, DECsystem-10s,
and DECSYSTEM-20s. These video terminals can work with other vendor's systems as well
as with Digital systems. Because half-duplex communications and ASCII support are
features of the VT102 and VT131 video terminals, they have the capability to work
with more systems.</P>

<H2>Major Features</H2>
<P>No matter which Digital video terminal you select, the VT100, VT101, VT102, VT131,
or the VT125, each member of the VT100 family contains the following universal
features.</P>
<H3>User-Oriented Features</H3>
<DL>
<DT>Detached sculptured keyboard</DT>
<DD>The keyboard and monitor can be positioned
separately for optimum use in your work environment. Since the keyboard has a layout
similar to that of an office typewriter, the transition from office typewriter to
terminal is easy.</DD>
<DT>ASCII character set</DT>
<DD>Industry standard ASCII characters offer
compatibility with Digital and non-Digital systems.</DD>
<DT>Numeric/application keypad</DT>
<DD>The calculator-style numeric keypad ensures
fast and easy number entering in data entry and financial applications. The
application keypad transmits control sequences instead of numeric codes that act as
program function codes to control predefined application-specific routines.</DD>
<DT>Cursor control keys</DT>
<DD>These send codes to the host to let you easily and
quickly position the cursor anywhere on the screen with a minimum of keystrokes.</DD>
<DT>Keyboard-selectable features</DT>
<DD>These include communication speeds,
keyclick, margin bell, dark/light background, and block/underline cursor. You can
configure the terminal to your personal preferences to maximize your
productivity.</DD>
<DT>Non-volatile memory set-up</DT>
<DD>Allows you to save and later recall the
keyboard features you have selected.</DD>
<DT>80 column &times; 24 lines display format</DT>
<DD>Used for standard video
terminal applications.</DD>
<DT>132 column &times; 14 lines (VT100, VT101, VT125) display</DT>
<DD>Allows you a
larger format for detailed or spread sheet work so you can preview reports prior to
printing. (<STRONG>Note:</STRONG> The advanced video option, which is standard with
the VT102 and VT131, provides 132 column &times; 24 lines display.)

</DD>
<DT>Selectable bidirectional smooth screen scrolling</DT>
<DD>With this feature you
can select smooth scroll or jump scroll. The smooth scroll feature of the VT100
family, when used with XON/XOFF transmission control, lets you read new lines of text
easily, even when transmission speeds are high. When jump scroll is selected, new
lines appear on the screen as fast as the host sends them to the terminal. At higher
baud rates, data can be difficult to read due to the rapid movement of lines.</DD>
<DT>Split-screen capability</DT>
<DD>With this feature, the host can scroll any subset
of the 24-line screen, while the rest of the screen remains fixed. This feature is
useful for many applications. For example, the host can maintain status information
on a fixed portion of the screen while interactive work is performed in the scrolling
area. This permits you to work with two information sources.</DD>
<DT>Double-width/double-height characters on a line-by-line basis</DT>
<DD>This
feature can provide versatility in display format for forms, prompting, and text
applications.</DD>
<DT>Reverse video</DT>
<DD>This is another selectable feature that allows you to
change the screen from black characters/white background to white characters/black
background, according to your preference.</DD>
<DT>Selectable screen intensity</DT>
<DD>You can adjust the screen to the amount of
light in the room for easier reading, and to suit personal preferences.</DD>
</DL>
<TABLE WIDTH="100%">
<CAPTION>The VT100 family gives you double-width/double-height characters on a line-by-line
basis. With the advanced video option, the terminals display bold, blink, underline
and reverse characters. These attributes can be turned on in any combination.</CAPTION>

<H3>Engineering Features</H3>
<DL>
<DT>ANSI-compatible command set</DT>
<DD>Terminal commands are compatible with ANSI
3.64 standards.</DD>
<DT>VT52-compatible command set</DT>
<DD>Permits compatibility with VT52
software.</DD>
<DT>Line drawing character set</DT>
<DD>The basic character set features 32 line
drawing and other graphic characters. These can be used to present solid-line
displays of simple forms and data plotting in a format that looks like that of a
hardcopy printout. (See <A HREF="appendixa.html">Appendix A</A> for more information
on the VT100 line drawing character sets.)</DD>
<DT>20-character answerback message</DT>
<DD>Provides you terminal with the ability
to identify itself by sending a message to the host. This message may be sent by the
operator or automatically sent to the host without operator intervention.</DD>
<DT>EIA RS-232 serial line interface</DT>
<DD>The VT100 family interfaces to
asynchronous communications line with a 25-pin connector, mounted on the back of the
terminal. This meets the requirements of EIA specification RS-232-C, the industry's
standard.</DD>
<DT>Full-duplex communication</DT>
<DD>Enables two-way simultaneous transmission
between your terminal and the host.</DD>
<DT>Automatic XON/XOFF buffer control</DT>
<DD>Generates synchronizing codes XOFF/XON
that can stop or resume data transmission.</DD>
<DT>Keyboard-selectable baud rate to 19,200 baud</DT>
<DD>Achieves compatibility in
communications between the video terminal and the host or between the video terminal
and another device, such as a printer.</DD>
</DL>
<H3>Easy Serviceability</H3>
<DL>
<DT>Self-test diagnostics</DT>
<DD>These diagnostics automatically or on command test
the condition of the terminal's non-volatile and internal memory, keyboard, and
advanced video memory (if this option is installed) to determine if a fault is
present.</DD>
<DT>Modular design</DT>
<DD>Ensures easy, fast, and inexpensive maintenance.</DD>
</DL>
<H2>Screen Attributes</H2>
<P>Digital's VT100 family of terminals allows a standard screen display of 24 lines
by 80 characters. Individual characters are based on a 7-by-9 dot matrix format for
crisp, clear display.</P>

<P>A keyclick is sounded by the terminal whenever a key is pressed. The following
are exceptions:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Shift or CTRL keys do not generate a keyclick because these keys do not
transmit a code to the host, but merely modify the codes transmitted by other keys.</LI>
<LI>KBD LOCKED indicator is turned on. In this case, the characters typed are lost.</LI>
<LI>The keyclick feature was turned off in Set-Up mode.</LI>
</UL>
<P>The long tone (bell) is sounded by your terminal to indicate one of the following:</P>
<UL>
<LI>A bell code was received from the host.</LI>
<LI>The cursor is eight characters away from the right margin and the margin bell
is enabled.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Finally, your terminal will sound the long tone several times in rapid succession
to indicate that the nonvolatile memory had difficulty in reading or writing the
set-up features. If this occurs, check the set-up features and then perform a recall
or save operation.</P>
<H2>Operator Features</H2>
<P>All VT100 family members incorporate features that can be selected in set-up.
Set-up features reflect either factory-installed default values or your choices. They
allow the terminal to be configured according to your preference, and provide
compatibility to the host and AC power source. Unlike some terminals, the VT100 family
does not use switches or jumpers to individually turn the built-in features on or off.
Instead, this family uses a nonvolatile memory (NVR) that always remembers what
features have been selected, just as if a switch had been set.</P>
<P>Set-up features can be selected by the host or by you through your terminal's
keyboard. When Set-Up is entered, the status of the features stored in the nonvolatile
memory are shown on the screen. These feature settings can either be stored
permanently in the nonvolatile memory or stored temporarily until the terminal is
turned off. Pressing SHIFT "S" during Set-up mode stores the current settings as
permanent. The terminal operation reflects the current feature selections. If a recall
operation is performed, the terminal is reset, or the terminal power is turned off,
all temporary feature settings are replaced by the features that have been stored in
NVR.</P>
<H3>Set-Up</H3>
<P>Set-Up mode provides two (or three for the VT131) brief descriptions of the current
feature status. Set-Up A displays the location of the tab stops set in the terminal
and a visual ruler that numbers each character position on the line. The status of
other terminal features is summarized in Set-Up B.</P>
<P>Entering Set-Up A is achieved by pressing the SET-UP key. The bottom line of the
display consists of a ruler, which numbers each character position available on a
line. The location of each tab stop is shown by a "T" placed above the ruler. To
change a tab, use the space bar to advance the cursor to any of the numbered character
positions. Press the Set/Clear Tab keys (@/2 key) when you reach the position where
you want to set or clear a tab. If there is a "T" present, the tab will be cleared.
If no "T" is at that location, a tab will be inserted. Once you have finished, you may
exit from Set-Up mode A by pressing the SET-UP key again.</P>
<P>Set-Up B mode only can be entered from Set-Up A mode. While in Set-Up A, press the
5 key on the main keyboard. This brings you into Set-Up B. See Figure 5-5.</P>

<P>To change any of the features shown in Figure 5-6, use your space bar to move the
cursor to the feature you want to change. Once the cursor is positioned over the
block to be changed, press the 6 key. This changes the bit to the opposite of what is
displayed &#8211; either 1 or 0. After you have selected all the features you want,
exit from Set-Up B mode by pressing the 5 key which returns you to Set-Up A mode, or
press the SET-UP key again to exit Set-Up mode.</P>
<P>The next section describes the features you can change once you are in Set-Up
B.</P>
<H4>Receive Speed</H4>
<P>When the terminal is in Set-Up B Mode, this key steps the terminal through the
receive baud rate settings in ascending order.</P>
<H4>Transmit Speed</H4>
<P>When the terminal is in Set-Up B Mode, this key steps the terminal through the
transmit baud rate settings in ascending order.</P>
<H4>Scroll</H4>
<P>Scrolling is the upward or downward movement of existing lines on the screen to
make room for new lines at the bottom or top of the screen. When using jump scroll,
new lines appear on the screen as fast as the host sends them to the terminal.
Smooth scroll places a limit on the speed at which new lines of data can be sent to
the terminal, but since the movement occurs at a smooth, steady pace, the data can
be read as it appears on the screen.</P>
<H4>Auto Repeat</H4>
<P>Auto Repeat causes a key to be repeated automatically at the rate of approximately
30 characters per second when the key is held down for more than one half second. So
if you need a certain character to be repeated, you don't have to retype it.</P>
<H4>Dark or Light Background</H4>
<P>In the normal screen mode, the display contains light characters on a dark
background. In the reverse screen mode, the display contains dark characters on a
light background. You can select whatever screen mode is more comfortable for you.</P>
<H4>Cursor</H4>
<P>The cursor display is used to indicate the active position or where the next typed
character will appear on the screen. You can select a block or underline cursor.</P>
<H4>XON/XOFF</H4>
<P>The VT100 family members are capable of automatically generating the synchronizing
codes XON (DC1) and XOFF (DC3). The XOFF code tells the host to stop the transmitting
of data. The XON code tells the host to resume transmitting data. This mode of
operation is required when smooth scroll, set-up, or the printer port is to be used.
It is also required for baud rates over 4,800 bits per second.</P>

</TABLE>
<H4>ANSI/VT52 Compatibility Mode</H4>
<P>With ANSI mode, the VT100 family will respond to software based on ANSI standards
&#8211; ANSI X3.4-1977, X3.41-1974, and X3.64-1979. VT52 compatibility mode lets the
terminal respond to software written for use with Digital's VT52 video terminal.</P>
<H4>Keyclick</H4>
<P>With this, you can choose to have a silent keyboard or hear an audible click each
time a key is pressed.</P>
<H4>Margin Bell</H4>
<P>The margin bell functions just like the bell in a typewriter. When the margin bell
is on, a tone will sound whenever the cursor is eight characters from the end of the
current line.</P>
<H4>Character Sets</H4>
<P>Choose between US. and U.K. character sets. The VT100 family contains character
sets for the United States and the United Kingdom. The only difference between these
two character sets in one character, the # or the &pound; symbol. When the standard
U.S. character set is selected, the uppercase 3 on the main keyboard displays the #
character. The &pound; character is displayed when the U.K. character set is
selected.</P>
<H4>Automatic Wraparound</H4>
<P>When this feature is selected, characters that would otherwise appear beyond the
right margin are automatically placed in the first character position of the next
line.</P>
<H4>New Line</H4>
<P>The new line feature enables the RETURN key on your terminal to function like the
RETURN on an electric typewriter. When the new line feature is enabled, pressing the
RETURN key generates the carriage return (CR) and the linefeed (LF) codes. When a
linefeed code is received, the code is interpreted as a carriage return and a
linefeed.</P>
<H4>Interlace Mode</H4>
<P>Interlacing allows you to display alternate rows of pixels in successive screen
sweeps. Digital terminals are factory set with interlace mode disabled. Although
Digital graphics applications do not require interlacing, this feature is
user-selectable.</P>
<H4>Power</H4>
<P>During the initial installation, the terminal display must be set to either the 50
or 60 Hertz power line frequency. In the United States, it is set to 60 Hertz.</P>
<H4>Bits Per Character</H4>
<P>This feature allows the terminal to transmit and receive either 7- or 8-bit
characters. When set for 8-bit operation, bit 8 is set to space or 0 for characters
transmitted and is ignored for all characters received.</P>
<H4>Parity</H4>
<P>Parity, when enabled, checks for single-bit errors in data transmission. If a
transmission error occurs, members of the VT100 family can often detect it and
indicate its presence by placing a checkerboard character on the screen in place of
the character with the error. When parity is disabled, no parity bit is transmitted
or received.</P>
<H4>Parity Sensing</H4>
<P>This feature defines which method of parity checking &#8211; odd or even &#8211; is
used. If the parity is turned off, the parity sense selection will be disregarded.</P>
<H4>Baud Rates</H4>
<P>Members of the VT100 family can transmit data at any one of the following speeds:
50, 75, 110, 134.5, 150, 200, 300, 600, 1200, 1800, 2000, 2400, 3600, 4800, 9600, or
19,200 bits per second.</P>
<P>These terminals are also capable of receiving data at any of the following defined
speeds: 50, 75, 110, 134.5, 150, 200, 300, 600, 1200, 1800, 2000, 2400, 3600, 4800,
9600, or 19,200 bits per second. The receive speed is independent of the transmit
speed. The terminal can receive data at one speed and transmit it at a different
speed.</P>
<H3>Answerback Message</H3>
<P>Answerback is a feature that provides the terminal with the ability to identify
itself by sending a message to the host. This message can be up to 20 characters in
length, including control characters. The entire answerback message sequence can take
place automatically without affecting the screen or requiring operator action if an
ENQ is sent to the terminal. You can send the answerback message by pressing the
CTRL and BREAK keys simultaneously.</P>
<P>To set the answerback message, use the following steps:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Place the terminal in Set-Up B mode.</LI>
<LI>Press the SHIFT and A keys simultaneously. The terminal will respond by placing
A = on the screen.</LI>
<LI>Type the message delimiter character which may be any character not used in the
actual answerback message. The message delimiter character is not part of the
answerback message. If you make a mistake when typing the answerback message, type the
message delimiter character again and go back to step 2. This is the only way to
correct errors in the answerback message.</LI>
<LI>Type the answerback message. The message may be up to 20 characters, including
space and control characters. Control characters will be displayed as a blackened
diamond-shaped character to indicate their presence in the message.</LI>
<LI>Type the message delimiter character. Once the message delimiter character is
typed, the answerback will disappear from the screen.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Once you have followed these steps, the answerback message will be temporarily
stored in the terminal and can be saved with a Save operation.</P>

</TABLE>
<H3>Save Operation</H3>
<P>You can change or store set-up features on either a temporary or fixed basis. To
temporarily store a feature, just exit set-up mode after changing the feature &#8211;
the terminal reacts according to the new setting. If a recall operation is performed,
or the terminal is reset, or the terminal power is turned off, all temporary feature
settings are replaced by the features that have been stored on a fixed basis.</P>
<P>If you want to store set-up feature settings on a permanent basis, follow the next
two save operation steps. First, place the terminal in set-up mode. Second, press the
SHIFT and S keys simultaneously. The screen will clear and the message "wait" will be
displayed in the upper-left corner. After a few seconds, the terminal will
automatically return to Set-Up A mode. You have now saved your set-up features in
nonvolatile memory.</P>
<H3>Recall Operation</H3>
<P>It is possible for temporarily stored feature settings to differ from those stored
on a fixed basis. If you want to return to the fixed settings, you can perform a
recall operation. First, place the terminal in set-up mode. Next, press the SHIFT and
R keys simultaneously. The screen will clear and the message "wait" will appear in
the upper-left corner of the screen. After a few seconds, the terminal will return to
Set-Up A mode. The VT102 and VT131 also have factory default settings that can be
recalled with SHIFT "D".</P>
<H3>Printing</H3>
<P>With the VT100's optional printer port or the standard printer port found on the
VT102, VT125, and VT131 terminals, you can attach your video terminal to a serial
printer for hardcopy output.</P>
<P>Your video terminal determines if the serial printer is connected and ready to
operate by the data terminal ready (DTR) interface signal of the printer. When the
DTR signal of the printer is on, the printer is ready to print. If a printer is not
connected, requests for printing are ignored.</P>
<P>If the printer is unable to print when a print operation is selected, print
requests cause the video terminal to wait for the print operation to be completed or
cancelled. During this time, the screen of the terminal will not display new
characters. After the print operation is complete or cancelled, the screen displays
new characters.</P>
<P>The printer may not be ready to print for one or more of the following reasons:</P>
<UL>
<LI>AC power is turned off.</LI>
<LI>The printer is off-line.</LI>
<LI>The printer is out of paper.</LI>
<LI>The printer is out of ribbon.</LI>
<LI>The printer cover is open.</LI>
<LI>The printhead is jammed.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Refer to the documentation provided with your printer to correct any of the above
situations, or consult the appropriate chapter within this handbook.</P>
<P>Printing is performed using one of four print operations: auto print which prints
one line at a time, print screen, printer controller, and print cursor line. All
print operations can be selected by the host while the terminal is on-line. Only auto
print and print screen operations can be selected from the video terminal's keyboard.
Keyboard-selected print operations are performed while the terminal is on-line or
off-line. If the terminal is off-line, the KBD LOCKED indicator goes on until printing
finishes. See your <CITE>User Guide</CITE> for more information.</P>
<P>Printing double-height and double-width characters results in printing the same
line twice with single-height and single-width characters. Double-width characters
are printed as single-width characters.</P>
<H4>Auto Print</H4>
<P>Auto print operation prints the current line before the cursor moves to the next
line. The cursor moves to the next line when the terminal receives a linefeed, form
feed, or vertical tab character. This character is also transmitted to the printer at
the end of the printed line.</P>
<P>If the auto wrap feature is on, characters received when the cursor is at the right
margin are automatically wrapped to the next line. Before the cursor moves to the next
line, the current line is printed. The auto wrapped line ends with the carriage return
and linefeed characters.</P>
<P>Select auto print using the following procedure. After verifying that the printer
is ready to print, hold down the CTRL key and press the (PRINT)/ENTER key, and then
release both keys. Although there is no visible indication on the screen, the current
line is printed before the cursor moves to the next line. When selected, auto print
operation continues until turned off.</P>
<P>If you want to stop printing, enter and exit set-up. The current line is not
printed, but the auto print feature stays selected. To turn off auto print, hold down
the CTRL key and press the (PRINT)/ENTER key, then release both keys.</P>
<H4>Print Screen</H4>
<P>The print screen command prints a copy of the screen. Depending on the print
features chosen in set-up, the scrolling region or complete screen is printed. The
scrolling region is the area of the screen between the top and bottom margins. The
top and bottom margins are selected by the host.</P>
<P>Select the print screen feature with the following procedure:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Verify that the printer is ready to print.</LI>
<LI>Hold down the SHIFT key, and press the (PRINT)/ENTER key and release both keys.
The characters displayed on the screen will be printed.</LI>
<LI>To stop the print screen operation before printing is complete, enter and exit
set-up.</LI>
</UL>
<P>In the case of both auto print and print screen operations, if printing has been
stopped by entering and exiting set-up mode, move the printhead to the left margin.
Refer to your printer's documentation for information about local operating procedures
used with the printer.</P>
<H4>Printer Controller</H4>
<P>Printer controller gives the host direct control of the printer. When printer
controller is selected, characters received from the host are not displayed on the
video screen. The characters are sent directly to the printer.</P>
<H4>Print Cursor Line</H4>
<P>This lets you print the current line without changing the cursor position.</P>
<H2>Programming Information</H2>
<P>Escape and control sequences provide functions not offered by control characters of
the character set. These sequences are multiple character control functions that are
not displayed but determine terminal operation. Escape and control sequences are
defined by ANSI X3.41-1977 and X3.64-1979. Refer to <A HREF="appendixb.html">Appendix
B</A> for more information about sequences and sequence formats or consult the
<CITE>User Guide</CITE> for your terminal model.</P>
<H2>Maintenance</H2>
<P>The VT100 family of terminals is designed to be easy to maintain. No preventative
maintenance is required. The terminals have built-in, self-test diagnostics that
greatly reduce the time necessary to isolate and repair faults. They also feature
automatic self-tests that are run every time the terminals are powered up. Refer to
the <CITE>User Guide</CITE> for your terminal model for more information about
self-tests, as well as descriptions of fatal and nonfatal errors. Should a repair
become necessary, Digital Field Service is available worldwide.</P>
<P>The VT100 family has proven to be an exceptionally reliable series of terminals.
There are just two mechanical switches &#8211; one for turning the terminal on, and
one for selecting the power supply voltage. The use of pop fasteners instead of screw
fasteners reduces the time and cost of repairs by providing easy access to all
components. All other functions, such as baud rates, tabs, and parity, for example,
are set via the keyboard and stored in the nonvolatile memory. The elimination of
mechanical switches aids the use of diagnostics for testing the terminal functions
and adapting to varying environments under host control.</P>
<H3>Self-Test</H3>
<P>A self-test mode is built into every VT100 family member. It automatically, or on
command, tests the condition of the terminal should a fault be suspected. This
self-test program checks the following items:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Advanced video (if included)</LI>
<LI>Nonvolatile memory</LI>
<LI>Internal memory</LI>
<LI>Keyboard</LI>
</UL>
<P>To invoke a self-test, you can:</P>
<UL>
<LI>turn the terminal on, or</LI>
<LI>hit the reset key while in set-up mode.</LI>
</UL>
<H3>Operator Troubleshooting Checklist</H3>
<P>If it appears that there is a problem in any member of the VT100 family of
terminals, initiate the power-up self-test program. This test will help to determine
if the problem lies in your terminal or in some other part of the computer system.</P>
