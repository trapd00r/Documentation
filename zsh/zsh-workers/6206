} That doesn't really matter, since if the option isn't set, $0 is the shell
} name and won't have a / in, so the test fails anyway.

Eh?  $0 will have a / in it if the shell was invoked by any mechanism other
than path search, or even if PATHDIRS is set and a partial path was used:

zagzig% echo $0
../zsh-3.1.5-build/zsh
zagzig% unsetopt functionargzero
zagzig% function foo() { echo $0 }
zagzig% foo
../zsh-3.1.5-build/zsh
zagzig%
