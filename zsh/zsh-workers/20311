You can see why if you add this style:

zstyle ':completion:*' format 'Completing %d -'

schaefer<690> sabcmd
Completing parameter name -
Completing stylesheet -
file1.xsl

I don't immediately know why an empty group is being created for parameter
names even when there are no parameters to be completed.
