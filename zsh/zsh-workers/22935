The doc in parameter expansion says

     The PATTERN may begin with a `#', in which case the PATTERN must
     match at the start of the string, or `%', in which case it must
     match at the end of the string.

Should that doc also say that #% is a legal pattern meaning "anchor
the match at both ends of the string"?
