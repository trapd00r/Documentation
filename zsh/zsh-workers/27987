I think your terminal is being screwed up somehow.  That explains both
why you can't see the echo output and can't see the ${+terminfo}.

It usually helps if you can boil bugs down to what happens with the "-f"
option, so we're not relying on unseen side effects of initialisation
scripts.

Also, I'm afraid we don't have the spare time to go poking around in
distribution's zshrc files, but if you think there's some effect we
(rather than the distribution) should know about, please do report it.
