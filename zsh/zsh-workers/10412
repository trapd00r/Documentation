Subject: PATCH: partial word completion


Some recent changes made a small bug show up, where, for example,
completion on an empty word in a directory with `foo.bar.baz' and
`boo.far.faz' inserted `.'.

The problem was that too many cline structs got the CLF_NEW flag
removed (CLF_NEW indicates newly build parts without anything
corresponding on the line).

Bye
 Sven

P.S.:     Are the log messages and the version numbers (_path_files went
          from 1.2 to 1.4) ok, or am I doing something wrong?
P.P.S.:   Yeah, right, I haven't tried to understand everything about
          CVS' version numbering facilities yet.
P.P.P.S.: Have I just made a fool out of myself?
