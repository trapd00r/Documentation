Subject: cvs-like file completion

Hi.  Anyone familiar with the intimacies of completion know how I could
make completion work like it does after "cvs add", but for a custom
shell script?

That is, I want to complete for a script cvsvimdiff all files that need
committing to the cvs repository.  Something like:

   compdef cvsvimdiff="cvs add"

This isn't legal, of course, but that's the idea.

Thanks for any input!
