I'm having problems getting zsh to use a custom-written completion
function.  The function is called _pd, definitely lives somewhere in
my $fpath, definitely gets autoloaded during startup, and has

  #compdef pd

as its first line.  Yet $_comps[pd] is undefined, and pressing TAB
after `pd ' results in standard file completion.  What have I missed?
