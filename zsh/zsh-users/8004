OK, so you're saying that in most contexts, you can do something like

  zstyle ':completion:*' file-patterns '*(#q-*)'

to complete only executable files, but the specific example

  zstyle ':completion:*:complete:-command-::commands' file-patterns '*(#q-*)'

doesn't work because it goes through the code the wrong way?  I would
say that *is* an annoyance, and that 99% of users don't care about
the difference between _files and _path_files.

Some cross-referencing between ignored-patterns and file-patterns might
be beneficial, too.

Presumably a side effect of using file-patterns is the _ignored
completer doesn't pick up the remaining files, but if I remember there
are ways of doing this with the all-files tag.
