} Can anyone explain this to me, please?

Did you happen to compile your dot-files with zcompile?

As previously discussed, aliases and compilation don't play well together
because compilation records the lexical tokens as of the instant of
compilation and bypasses alias expansion at time of execution.  It's the
same problem as "Bart Schaefer's rule" in FAQ 2.3, except that the entire
zcompile'd file behaves as if it were one giant function definition.

Even if that's not your problem, it probably deserves a FAQ mention.
