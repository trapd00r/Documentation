  My gut feeling is that zsh's behaviour in this regard is correct,
since I always thought there was a core belief (among UNIX software in
general, not just zsh) that the software should "do what I say, exactly
as I say, and not second-guess me".
  However, having said that, I think your function is quite useful
and that a lot of people will like/use it (possibly myself included).
Thanks for taking the time to write it. :)

      Fascism should more appropriately be called Corporatism
        because it is a merger of state and corporate power.
