For this to work we need

 ... somebody, who will collect patches and keep CVS in sync

or (better yet)

 ... the key ZSH developers should have write access to repository and do direct
updates there. There is no point in sending patches to list then. Some
announcement/notification is still welcome - e.g. SAMBA has CVS list with commit
messages. But setting up yet another list needs cooperation form Sunsite as well
... sigh.

I opt for the latter. We just need some common framework (branches/tag names
etc). And commit messages may probably go to the zsh-workers (with some special
subject. I believe, it can be setup in CVS).
