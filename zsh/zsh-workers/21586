That change results in an erroneous "Test successful" message when a
test fails and verbosity is at least 1.  Did you check if any of the
test cases expected the success of an earlier test in a later test?
If so, it might be best to just leave the abort-after-the-first-failure
behavior unchanged.

That fixed trap code seems to make it impossible to Ctrl-C out of the
tests, though I'm not sure why yet.  Perhaps it's a bug in trap
handling, but zsh hangs when that cleanup trap in place and Ctrl-C is
pressed.

In the meantime, I've checked in a change that just disables the trap
line (since zsh now complains about its incorrect syntax).
