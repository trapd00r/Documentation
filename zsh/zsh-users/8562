Hi,
I used a tip from one of the faqs (Peter Stephenson I think) to autoload all my 
zsh shell scripts.

autoload ${fpath[1]}/*(:t)  #autoload all functions in $fpath

As I also use the same directory for my legacy bash scripts, I was unpleasantly 
surprised to find that these scripts had also been autoloaded and were now being 
treated as zsh scripts.

Easy to fix, either I make the scripts zsh compatible or move them elsewhere.

Q1)
But is that expected behaviour (latest zsh on cygwin)?

Q2)
I was surprised to what extent my bash scripts worked as zsh (mostly only 
required the adding of a pre-declaration of any variables), is a reasonable 
proportion of bash available from within zsh?
