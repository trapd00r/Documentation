<H1 CLASS="chapterhead">Letterprinter 100/Letterwriter 100 (LA100)</H1>
<H2>Overview</H2>
<P>The desktop Letterprinter 100 and Letterwriter 100 are serial, asynchronous printers
using dot-matrix technology. Packed into these printers are a variety of capabilities
&#8211; high-speed printing, letter-quality printing, multiple typefaces, full bit-map
graphics and national character sets. The LA100 series can be used for applications that
require both text and graphics output, such as drafts of business and technical reports,
graphs and bar charts. In addition to draft-quality and letter-quality printing, the
Letterwriter and Letterprinter feature an optional memo-quality mode suitable for internal
memos.</P>
<P>What's truly remarkable about the Letterprinter 100 and Letterwriter 100 is that you
can select from a variety of resident typefaces or an ever greater selection of plug-in
font cartridges. A maximum of two plug-in cartridges can be used at any time, while up to
three additional internal fonts (on read-only memory chips) can be field-installed.
Therefore, you can have five different character fonts available for printing at any one
time &#8211; either as five internal fonts or as three internal and two external fonts.
You can change the fonts any time during printing. When you combine typeface variety with
expanded or compressed character widths and graphics printing, it is easy to see that
individualized and customized copies can be created. Any combination of styles can be
contained within a single report, page, or even a single line.</P>
<P>There are seven versions of the LA100 series.</P>

<H2>Printing Features</H2>
<P>The Letterprinter 100 and Letterwriter 100 offer three program-selectable text printing
modes. Using a nine-wire printhead enables the LA100 series to print below-the-line
descenders, such as on the letters "p," "q," and "y," as well as underlining in all text
modes. The graphics mode can be used to plot graphs and draw pictures that include
shading and curved lines.</P>
<H3>Letter-quality Printing</H3>
<P>At a speed of 30 characters per second, the printhead uses a 33 by 18 matrix of dots to
produce sharp, clear characters. This letter-quality printing is suitable for your
reports, proposals and business correspondence.</P>
<H3>Draft Printing</H3>
<P>The seven-by-nine dot-matrix character cell provides high-speed output at the rate of
240 characters per second. This is suitable for draft and data printing. Printing is done
through a bidirectional technique in which the printhead seeks the shortest distance to
the next printable character, rapidly skipping over blank spaces.</P>

</TABLE>
<H3>Optional Memo Printing</H3>
<P>The printhead prints a character using a matrix of 33 by 9 dots and produces a
character that is darker than draft-quality characters, but not as clear and dark as
letter-quality ones. Memo mode prints 80 characters per second and is available as an
optional ROM cartridge or ROM chip.</P>

<H3>Graphics Printing</H3>
<P>In graphics mode, the Letterprinter and Letterwriter 100s print 72 dots per inch
vertically. The number of horizontal dots per inch depends on which microcode version
your model uses.</P>
<P>Version 1 microcode gives you 132 horizontal columns. Version 2 microcode, found on
receive-only models, lets you select from eight ranges of horizontal columns.</P>
<UL>
<LI>73.3 to 330 dots per inch</LI>

<H2>Fonts</H2>
<P>The font features on the Letterprinter 100 and Letterwriter 100 give you a wide variety
of standard character sets and fonts to choose from. Fonts can be changed under program
control or by inserting a plug-in ROM cartridge. These fonts let you change any of a
character's four attributes &#8211; typestyle (font), size (pitch), quality (density),
and character set &#8211; without changing a printwheel or other print element.</P>
<P>Let's take <CITE>U.S./U.K. Courier 10 High Density</CITE> as an example to illustrate
these four character attributes.</P>
<UL>
<LI>U.S./U.K. represents the United States and United Kingdom character sets.</LI>
<LI>The typestyle is Courier.</LI>
<LI>The character size is 10 characters per inch.</LI>
<LI>High density means letter-quality print.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Any or all of these attributes can be changed. A group of characters of the same style,
size and density, organized in one or more character sets is called a dot pattern set
(DPS). With the Letterprinter and Letterwriter 100 you can have up to five DPS's installed
at once. This allows you to change typestyle, size, quality and character set
electronically. These DPS are accessible by either you or the host CPU.</P>
<P>DPS ROMs are referred to as font ROMs since they are often used to change typestyle.
However, the typestyle is but one of the four attributes that can be changed. Throughout
this chapter, the word font refers to only the typestyle, while DPS is a general term
applied to any character attribute.</P>
<P>A DPS is stored in a read-only memory (ROM). A single 64K ROM contains about 94
characters. A DPS can consist of one or two 94-character ROMs. If the DPS consists of just
one ROM, this stand-alone ROM is called a primary ROM. When a DPS consists of two ROMs,
one is a stand-alone ROM and the other is a complementary ROM, called an overlay. An
overlay cannot be used by itself.</P>
<TABLE WIDTH="100%">

or 256 (8-bit mode) character codes. Thirty-four (7-bit mode) or 68 (8-bit mode)
characters are used for control characters leaving 94 (7-bit mode) or 188 (8-bit mode)
printable characters. This means you can access one (7-bit mode) or two (8-bit mode)
groups of 94 characters at once. Each group of 94 characters forms a character set.</P>
<P>Character sets can be changed any time using set-up mode or the ANSI selection
sequences. Refer to your <CITE>Letterwriter 100 Operator Guide</CITE> and
<A HREF="http://vt100.net/docs/la100-rm/"><CITE>LA100-Series Programmer Reference Manual</CITE></A> for more details. Digital has a DPS
for such languages as English, French, Italian and others, as well as technical symbols,
APL and the VT100 line-drawing set. DPS can also cover individual needs such as musical
symbols and company logos.</P>
<H3>Typestyle (Fonts)</H3>
<P>The LA100-series can print characters using different typestyles or fonts. You can
choose from Courier, Gothic and Orator. The typestyle can be changed any time
electronically under program control or manually by inserting a different plug-in
cartridge or pushing the select button. See the <A HREF="http://vt100.net/docs/la100-rm/"><CITE>LA100-Series Programmer Reference
Manual</CITE></A> for more details.</P>
<H3>Character Set Versus Typestyle</H3>
<P>Five typestyles and a large number of character sets can be resident in the LA100 at
the same time. If you want to change the way a character looks, you change the typestyle,
for example, from Courier to Gothic, a difference similar to that between <TT>a</TT>
and <EM>a</EM>. If you need a national character, <EM>&auml;</EM>, or special symbol,
&#960;, you select different character sets.</P>
<H3>Size (Pitch)</H3>
<P>Pitch is the size of a character cell. It consists of vertical and horizontal pitch. On
the LA100-series, the vertical pitch defines the height of the character cell, while the
horizontal pitch defines the width. The vertical pitch is fixed at 0.135 inches. You can
choose the horizontal pitch you want at either 5, 6, 6.6, 8.25, 10, 12, 13.2 or 16.5
characters per inch.</P>
<P>Each DPS has a designed or standard pitch, which is usually 10 or 12 characters per
inch, and is optimized to give the best result at that pitch. For example, U.S./U.K.
Courier 10 High Density used 10 characters per inch as the standard pitch.</P>
<P>Characters printed in draft mode or low density can be printed using any of the eight
horizontal pitch selections since the pattern is modified to match the requested pitch.
To achieve the desired quality, characters printed in letter-quality mode (high density)
use different dot patterns for different pitches, unless the requested pitch is exactly
double the standard pitch.</P>
<P>For example, when printing characters in high density using Courier 10, the printer
uses the same DPS to print characters at 10 or 5 characters per inch. For other pitches
using Courier 10, the DPS is modified to fit the proper-sized character cell.</P>
<P>The horizontal pitch can be changed any time using set-up, the multiple font option,
if installed, or the ANSI selection sequences. Refer to the <CITE>Letterwriter 100
Operator Guide</CITE> or the <A HREF="http://vt100.net/docs/la100-rm/"><CITE>Programmer Reference Manual</CITE></A> for more
details.</P>
<H3>Quality (Density)</H3>
<P>The quality of type is changed on the LA100-series by varying the number of dots within
a character cell. There are three levels of quality available for the LA100:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Low density &#8211; a character is created by using a 7-by-9 grid for single width
horizontal pitches. An 8-by-9 grid is used for double-width pitches.</LI>
<LI>Medium density &#8211; a character is created using a 28-by-9 grid at 12 characters
per inch, and a 33-by-9 grid at 10 characters per inch.</LI>
<LI>High density &#8211; a character is created using a 28-by-18 grid at 12 characters per
inch, and a 33-by-18 grid at 10 characters per inch.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Within one DPS you have a draft mode grid and a letter mode grid. If you want a
particular type style in both medium and high densities, you need two separate DPS's.</P>
<P>The quality can be changed any time using the AUTO MAN and LETTER DRAFT keys or the
ANSI-compatible selection sequences. Check your <CITE>Letterwriter 100 Operator
Guide</CITE> and <A HREF="http://vt100.net/docs/la100-rm/"><CITE>LA100-Series Programmers Reference Manual</CITE></A> for more
detail.</P>
<H3>DPS Special Uses</H3>
<P>The DPS's contain all of the information required to define each character, each
character set, the style, pitch, density, and overlay characteristics. Because all of the
character attributes are contained in the DPS and not in the printer, Digital can create
new DPS ROMs to cover your special applications. The following are some examples of
special-use DPS ROMs that you can create or have Digital create for you.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Technical symbols such as chemical and electrical</LI>
<LI>Additional language character sets such as Arabic and Russian</LI>
<LI>Extended or compressed-sized characters</LI>
<LI>A single ROM subset of a two-ROM DPS to reduce the number of ROM slots used</LI>
<LI>Sideways characters to label artwork</LI>
<LI>Pieces of images such as logos and signature</LI>
</UL>
<H3>Installation</H3>
<P>You can install a primary cartridge in either slot 2 or slot 4. When installing a
primary and overlay pair, you must install the primary in slot 2 and the overlay in slot
4. An overlay cartridge installed without the corresponding primary cartridge will not
print.</P>
<P>Whether you install the cartridge or the overlay first is not important, nor is it
necessary to turn the printer off. However, if you install or attempt to change a
cartridge while the terminal is printing, the Letterprinter 100 and Letterwriter 100 abort
the line currently printing and the following line. Since the DPS cannot be accessed while
the cartridge is in motion, the two lines already in the buffer are printed using blanks.
Once the motion of the printhead stops, the printer restarts the printing process.</P>
<P>Installing a ROM DPS is easy. Just follow these steps.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Open the door on the multiple font option.</LI>
<LI>Gently slide the ROM cartridge into the multiple font option until it is fully in
place.</LI>
<LI>Within a few seconds of insertion, check that the ROM cartridge indicator light is
on.</LI>

</TABLE>
<H3>Installation Tests</H3>
<P>There are three basic tests to check proper cartridge installation.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Cartridge electrical insertion test (described in <CITE>Installation</CITE>
section.)</LI>
<LI>Insertion power-up/checksum test</LI>
<LI>Status message</LI>
</UL>
<P>To ensure proper operation of DPS ROM cartridges, make sure that you have:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Fully inserted the cartridge right side up and not bent the DPS ROM pins.</LI>
<LI>Inserted the cartridge in the correct slot. For example, if the overlay cartridge has
been inserted in slot 2, rather than slot 4, remove it and place it in the right
slot.</LI>
<LI>Installed an overlay with the corresponding primary DPS ROM.</LI>
</UL>
<H4>Insertion/Power-up checksum</H4>
<P>When power is applied or when a cartridge is inserted, the printer performs an internal
check. It tries to access the DPS ROMs and if a DPS ROM is present, it is tested. If the
test fails, the printer indicates the faulty DPS ROM by flashing the DSR and POWER/FAULT
lights.</P>
<P>If an error is detected, turn off the power to the printer. DPS ROMs are checked
sequentially until a failure, if present, is displayed. In the case of a failure, check
that the ROM was properly installed. If not, reinstall it correctly. If there is still no
change, replace the faulty cartridge and then turn the printer back on. If an error still
persists, check your service documentation for more details.</P>
<H4>Status Message Test</H4>
<P>Print the status message to check that the printer recognizes an installed DPS. The
third line of the status message contains a unique three-digit code for each DPS
installed, up to five. Table 10-2 lists the currently available DPS's and their
corresponding ROM identification codes.</P>

control to the host. Each time the switch is pressed the LA100 advances to the next state,
skipping fonts that are not installed. If the currently force font is removed, the
printer advances to the next valid state. <STRONG>Note:</STRONG> To force a font means
that everything is printed using that font despite all computer commands.</P>
<H3>Keyboard</H3>
<P>The Letterwriter 100's keyboard is arranged like a standard office typewriter and
operates in a similar manner. The keyboard keys are grouped into three categories:
standard keys, function keys and set-up keys.</P>

</TR>
</TBODY>
</TABLE>
<H4>Standard Keys</H4>
<P>The standard keys are standard typewriter keys and include CAPS LOCK and SHIFT. These
keys are used to send characters to the computer. In local mode or when local echo is
selected, they operate the same as typewriter keys.</P>
<P>Automatic repeat allows for a key that is depressed for more than half a second to send
its code to the computer repeatedly until the key is released. Normally, you would just
press the desired key and release it, sending the desired key to the host computer
once.</P>
<P>The CAPS LOCK key is a two-position locking key, similar to the LOCK key on a standard
typewriter. When it is in the down position, the alphabetic keys generate uppercase
characters, regardless of SHIFT key position. When it is in the up position, the
alphabetic keys generate lowercase or uppercase characters. The numeric, special symbol,
function, and numeric keypad keys are not affected by the CAPS LOCK key in either
position.</P>
<P>Both of the SHIFT keys cause all the standard keys on the keyboard to generate
uppercase characters or top row symbols, such as ! or #. The SHIFT keys do not affect the
function keys or the numeric keypad keys.</P>
<H4>Function Keys</H4>
<P>The Letterwriter 100 features over 17 function keys. Some of these keys and their
functions are:</P>
<UL>
<LI>ESC &#8211; Causes the printer to generate the escape control character.</LI>
<LI>CTRL &#8211; Causes the terminal to generate control characters when certain control
keys on the keyboard are pressed while holding the CTRL key down.</LI>
<LI>AUTO/MANUAL &#8211; The up AUTO position lets print quality be controlled by the
processor, while the down MANUAL position lets you control print quality by using the
LETTER/DRAFT key.</LI>
<LI>LETTER/DRAFT &#8211; In the up LETTER position, the terminal prints letter-quality
characters, while in the down DRAFT position, the terminal prints draft mode characters.
This feature is enabled only if manual mode has been selected. See AUTO/MANUAL description
above.</LI>
<LI>LINE/LOCAL &#8211; Switches the terminal between on-line mode and local mode. When the
terminal is on-line, the LINE indicator is on. (KSR terminals only.)</LI>
<LI>HERE IS &#8211; Sends the answerback message to the host, if the terminal is on-line
and an answerback message has been defined and stored.</LI>
<LI>BREAK &#8211; Causes the terminal to transmit a short break signal with a fixed time
duration.</LI>
<LI>PF1, PF2, PF3, PF4 &#8211; These keys cause the terminal to generate escape sequences
that are application specific.</LI>
</UL>
<H4>Set-Up Keys</H4>
<P>The set-up keys allow you to tailor your terminal's operation to your needs. The SET-UP
key can be used with almost any other key to let you perform a specific function. The
SET-UP key itself lets you enter and exit from Set-Up mode.</P>
<P>The Set-Up keys allow you to:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Set or clear tabs.</LI>
<LI>Set or clear the top, bottom, left or right margins.</LI>
<LI>Select the current paper position as the top of the form.</LI>
<LI>Position the paper and set page length.</LI>
<LI>Print the terminal status message. This status message tells you what Set-Up features
have been selected.</LI>
<LI>Recall the Set-Up features stored in the nonvolatile memory.</LI>
<LI>Store the operator-selected features as well as other features in the nonvolatile
memory.</LI>
</UL>
<H3>Visual Indicators</H3>
<P>When power is applied to the printer, the visual indicators are on for about six-tenths
of a second to allow you to check for a bad indicator.</P>

<P>There is no need to select the number of stop bits since the LA100 automatically
matches any host that requests 1 or 2 stop bits.</P>
<H5>Baud Rate Selection</H5>
<P>You can select the speed at which the terminal transmits and receives characters. For
systems in which transmit and receive speeds are different, you can select split speed
baud rates. Choose from the following:</P>
<UL>
<LI>50, 75, 110, 134.5, 150, 200, 300, 600, 1200, 1800, 2400, 4800, 7200, or 9600</LI>
<LI>75 send/600 receive, 75 send/1,200 receive, 150 send/600 receive, 150 send/1,200
receive, 300 send/2,400 receive, 300 send/4,800 receive, 600 send/2,400 receive, or 600
send/4,800 receive.</LI>
</UL>
<H5>Modem Control</H5>
<P>This feature controls the EIA control lines that communicate with the host. More
information about this can be found in the <A HREF="http://vt100.net/docs/la100-rm/"><CITE>LA100-Series Programmer Reference
Manual</CITE></A>. Modem control choices are:</P>
<UL>
<LI>No modem control, restraint mode</LI>
<LI>No modem control, speed control mode</LI>
<LI>Modem control, restraint control</LI>
<LI>Modem control, speed control mode</LI>
</UL>
<P>If you are using the 20&nbsp;mA current loop option or if your modem does not use the
protocol specified in the <CITE>Letterwriter 100 Operator Guide</CITE>, do not select
modem control. Do not select speed control mode unless using Bell 212 or an
equivalent.</P>
<H5>Paper Fault</H5>
<P>This feature describes the action the printer takes when a paper fault occurs. Four
responses are available:</P>
<UL>
<LI>No action &#8211; Usually selected for hardwired installations or when no disconnect
is desired.</LI>
<LI>Send break &#8211; Causes the printer to transmit a 275-millisecond BREAK signal when
a paper fault occurs.</LI>
<LI>Disconnect &#8211; Causes the printer to turn the data printer ready (DTR) signal off
immediately.</LI>
<LI>Do not answer &#8211; Used with the roll paper holder with "paper low" sensor. Lets
the printer complete any call in progress. When the call is completed, the printer
disconnects (turns off the DTR signal) and does not answer any new calls.</LI>
</UL>
<H5>Local Echo</H5>
<P>When the local echo feature is chosen, every character sent to the computer is also
printed by the printer. If local echo is off, then characters transmitted to the computer
are not printed as typed.</P>
<P>Your choice is either local echo or no local echo.</P>
<H5>Auto-XON/XOFF</H5>
<P>This feature prevents the loss of received characters. When auto-XON/XOFF is on, the
printer transmits the XON and XOFF control characters to indicate when the input buffer
is almost empty of full. The XOFF character requests the host to stop sending characters,
while the XON character means that character transmission can continue.</P>
<P>When Auto-XON/XOFF is disabled synchronization is obtained by using the restraint
signals. See your <A HREF="http://vt100.net/docs/la100-rm/"><CITE>LA100-Series Programmer Reference Manual</CITE></A> for details.</P>
<P>You can enable or disable this feature.</P>
<H5>Answerback</H5>
<P>This is a message of up to 30 characters that identifies the printer for the host. This
message is transmitted from the printer upon the computer's request or when you press the
HERE IS key, or automatically when communication was established by enabling
auto-answerback.</P>
<H5>Auto-Answerback</H5>
<P>Auto-answerback controls automatic transmission of the answerback message when a
communication connection is made.</P>
<P>Your choice is to enable or disable this feature.</P>
<H4>Keyboard Features</H4>
<P>Some features are available to adapt the keyboard to various printer applications.

<H4>Printer Features</H4>
<P>Printer features allow you to position a form, set or clear margins and tabs, and
select vertical and horizontal pitch. These features can be easily selected through the
keyboard by typing in the appropriate escape sequence.</P>
<P>You can select from the following features:</P>
<H5>End-of-Line Control</H5>
<P>This feature prevents received characters from being lost when the host attempts to
print beyond the right margin.</P>
<P>When end-of-line control is set to truncate, any characters received beyond the right
margin are discarded. When end-of-line control is set to wraparound, the printer performs
an automatic carriage return and linefeed and prints the characters received at the left
margin on the next line.</P>
<H5>Page Length</H5>
<P>The LA100 series can operate in one of two modes: form mode, or no form mode, which is
used for roll paper applications. In the no form mode, there is no form length or vertical
margins. Printing occurs continuously with lines being spaced apart according to the
selected vertical pitch.</P>
<P>When in form mode, the terminal will not print above the top margin or below the bottom
margin, and lines are spaced so that the distance between the active line and the top
margin is always a multiple of the current vertical pitch.</P>
<P>When a form length of zero is defined, the LA100 printers assume that roll paper is
being used and enter the no form mode. When a nonzero form length is given, the printer
assumes that form paper is being used, and enters the form mode.</P>
<P>The form length can be set to any length from 1/12 inch per page to 21 inches per
page.</P>

<H5>Horizontal Tabs</H5>
<P>A horizontal tab is a preselected point on a line to which the printhead advances when
a horizontal tab control character is received. The Letterwriter 100 and Letterprinter
100 have 217 possible horizontal tab stops, one for each column. These tab stops are
associated with column numbers, not physical positions on the paper. Thus, as was the
case with horizontal margins, changing horizontal pitch will also change the physical
position of tab stops.</P>
<H5>Print Density</H5>
<P>With the LA100 Series, you can select high- or medium-resolution printing for greater
emphasis.</P>
<H5>Vertical Pitch</H5>
<P>This allows you to vary the number of lines per inch. You can select to use 2, 3, 4, 6,
8 or 12 lines per inch.</P>

<TD ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="fig1014" ALT=""></TD>
</TR>
</TBODY>
</TABLE>
<H5>Vertical Margins</H5>
<P>You can set top and bottom vertical margins with this feature. The top vertical margin
specifies the first printable line, while the bottom vertical margin specifies the last
printable line. When vertical pitch and form length are changed, the vertical margins
must be reset.</P>
<H5>Vertical Tabs</H5>
<P>A vertical tab is a preselected line to which the printhead advances when a vertical
tab control character is received. The printer has 168 vertical tab positions. Vertical
tabs can be set and cleared like horizontal tabs. Vertical tab stops are associated with
specific line numbers, not physical positions on the paper. Thus, changing vertical pitch
changes the printing position of the vertical tabs on the paper.</P>
<H3>Escape Sequences</H3>
<P>The Letterprinter 100 and Letterwriter 100 (LA100) use escape sequences standardized
by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) to control many of their features.
These escape sequences provide additional controls that are not provided by the control
characters in the character set. These sequences, multiple-character control functions,
are not printed, but are used to control printing and printer operations such as advancing
the paper or ringing the margin bell.</P>
<P>Detailed information on escape sequences can be found in the <A HREF="http://vt100.net/docs/la100-rm/"><CITE>LA100-Series
Programmer Reference Manual</CITE></A> or in <A HREF="appendixg.html">Appendix G</A> at the
end of this book.</P>
<H2>Maintenance</H2>
<P>The Letterwriter 100 and Letterprinter 100 do not need preventative maintenance. The
surfaces and platen can be cleaned with a damp cloth. Do not use excessive water or
cleaners with solvents. Rubbing the keycaps with a dry or barely moist cloth is enough
to clean them. <STRONG>Note:</STRONG> Do not attempt to remove the keycaps to clean them.
You can damage the switch contacts if you replace the keycaps incorrectly.</P>
<P>To maintain proper operating temperatures, keep the printer away from extreme
temperatures, such as direct sunlight, room heaters, and air conditioners.</P>
<H3>Self-tests</H3>
<P>The LA100 can perform a power-up self-test and several printer self-tests.</P>
<H4>Power-up Self-test</H4>
<P>A power-up self-test is performed whenever power to the terminal is turned on. Any
errors during this self-test are displayed by the keyboard indicators. The table below
lists some power-up self-test indicators.</P>
