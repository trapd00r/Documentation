Almost the same as how I felt... but I wasn't exact enough again: the
problem is that some of the things I don't like in the present state
were not implemented by me and some are not fully understood by
me -- and I'm always a reluctant to change code that is not from me
(yes, really!). So, I thought that I should wait a little bit longer
until at least some people here have gone through the stuff and can
help to decide what should be changed to what. Or decide on their own
(and build the patches).


Bye
 Sven

P.S.: You know that I'm sometimes not exactly slow -- I didn't plan to 
      wait weeks ;-)
