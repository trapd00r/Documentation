Amol Deshpande <amold@MICROSOFT.com> recently ported zsh-3.0.2 to Win95/NT.
The port can be found on ftp.blarg.net:/users/amol/zsh/.  The port is quite
new and probably not very well tested.  I have no access to Win95/NT boxes
so I cannot test this port.  Amol used Microsoft Visual C++ for the port.
