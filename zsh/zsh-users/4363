Nothing -- if you take the time to _read_ the mail to which you're
replying, before launching into a tirade, you might notice that I
actually pointed to "zmodload math/compfunc" and then using the float()
function.  I wasn't saying that zsh is not useful.

What has this got to do with it?  Is C an exemplar of good design, now?

Yet Another typeset flag.  There are already flags handling how
parameters are displayed, alignment, etc etc.  One to say "display this
param as though using %g".

Across all scientific fields, skeptical analysis of technical claims made by
others, and the presentation of detailed evidence to support such analysis,=
 is
the heart of the scientific method. To outlaw such analysis is to outlaw the
scientific method itself. -- Ed Felten; declaration in Felten v RIAA 2001-0=
