} Have a look at Misc/compctl-examples and Functions/cdmatch2.

These examples would be a lot more helpful if they included some comments
explaining which of zsh's baroque parameter manipulation features they are
(ab)using, and why.  It's pretty obvious that Peter's function and Zoltan's
are both doing the same basic thing; but I have NO idea what reply[(r)]
in Zoltan's version means, since according to the documentation the (r)
should be followed by a pattern.
