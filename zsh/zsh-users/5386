Okay.

That's what I did originally and it failed to run on 2.6.  Since in
general, compiling on a lower OS version alows running on higher versions,
I unpacked the 4.0.6 distro into a clean directory and ran configure/make
on a 2.6 box.  Configure just assumed there was a /usr/lib/libcurses.so.1
but there isn't on 2.6.

I tried rebuilding from scratch again on 2.6 and it works on 2.6, 2.7 and
2.8.  All I can think of is I must have somehow been running a version
built with 2.8.  Probably a link I'd created.

Sorry for the noise ...

Thanks,
-Bill
