There was a discussion about something like this last year; search the 
archives for "Vi ZLE bindings".

The short answer is that the only way to do it is to create your own
widget functions for all of the vi commands that change modes.  There
is no "callback" associated with changing the keymap that can be used
to update the prompt.
