this does what i'd expect:

  $ ls -lh =lpr-portrait =lpr-landscape
  -rwxr-xr-x  1 atom  atom  89B Nov 21 04:13 /home/atom/bin/lpr-landscape
  -rwxr-xr-x  1 atom  atom  88B Nov 21 04:11 /home/atom/bin/lpr-portrait


but if i try to use TAB to expand "=lpr-*" it doesn't work. even without a 
TAB expansion, i get this:

  $ ls -lh =lpr-*
  zsh: lpr-* not found

another example that i'd expect to "just work":
  $ ls -l =*grep
  zsh: *grep not found

i'd expect that to return:
  /usr/bin/grep
  /usr/bin/egrep
  /usr/bin/fgrep
  /usr/bin/bzgrep
  /usr/bin/bzegrep
  /usr/bin/bzfgrep
  /usr/bin/zgrep
  /usr/bin/zegrep
  /usr/bin/zfgrep
  /usr/bin/pgrep
  /usr/local/bin/msggrep
  /usr/local/bin/zipgrep
  /usr/local/bin/pcregrep

(a lot of greps, and i haven't even installed ngrep on this box, yet.)

ZSH_VERSION=4.3.2

intuitively, the string "=lpr-*" should expand both with the TAB and when 
executed on the command line. a quick look at the man pages doesn't seem 
to indicate that this wouldn't work.

  1) is this a zsh bug?
  2) a documentation bug?
  3) operator error?

thanks...
