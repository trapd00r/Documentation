Subject: completion listing and singlelinezle.  Not!
Date: Tue, 05 Feb 2002 17:52:37 +0000
Message-ID: <12996.1012931557@csr.com>
From: Peter Stephenson <pws@csr.com>

A colleague pointed out to me that somebody on comp.unix.shell found out
that singlelinezle completely screws up completion listings.  They were
using 4.0.4, but it's still that way.  It doesn't depend on old or new
completion, nor on alwayslastprompt (which they didn't seem to know
about).  I can understand that alwayslastprompt wouldn't work too well if
you can't go up, but completion listings should surely work.

I tried back in 3.0.6 (pre-installed on this Solaris 5.8 system) and it
sort-of worked, without alwayslastprompt behaviour, but there is an odd bug
that the display doesn't get refreshed properly until you type another
character.  I hope that's an old bug we don't need to worry about any
more.

I can't get news myself here, so can't pass on the message or email.
