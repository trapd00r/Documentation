} BTW, there's one other thing with HP-UX tests I've been ignoring until
} now, but would like to look at shortly.  They end with:
} 	rm: cannot remove `Modules/zsh/parameter.so': Text file busy
} 	rm: cannot remove `Modules/zsh/zutil.so': Text file busy
} 	rm: cannot remove `Modules/zsh/complete.so': Text file busy
} 	rm: cannot remove `Modules/zsh/complist.so': Text file busy
} 	rm: cannot remove `Modules/zsh/computil.so': Text file busy
} 	rm: cannot remove `Modules/zsh/zle.so': Text file busy

The test script creates a shadow directory with copies of all the
shared objects so that it has a stable module_path for zmodload.
HP-UX does paging for shared objects directly out of their files,
so those files can't be removed while loaded by an application.

It might work to "zmodload -u" the modules before "rm"ing the files.
However:

schaefer<501> zmodload -u $(zmodload)
zmodload: module zsh/complete is in use by another module and cannot be unl=
oaded
zmodload: module zsh/zle is in use by another module and cannot be unloaded
schaefer<502> zmodload -u $(zmodload)

Apparently zle's cleanup_() routine is not quite comprehensive enough;
maybe some of what's in finish_() needs to be in cleanup_() instead?
Or perhaps it needs to unsetopt ZLE ...
