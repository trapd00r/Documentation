Hi John,

It really is not a good idea to "set" the FPATH in any of your init scripts,
despite what your chi and harmony might lead you to believe.  ;)  Things will
break in unpredictable ways when you upgrade or try to use your init scipts
on a different machine.

There is a $fpath variable, which is an array that mirrors the contents of
$FPATH (e.g. when you modify one, the other will change as well).  I find it
easier to play with arrays, for example the following:

fpath=(${LE_ETC}/shell/zsh/autoloads/interactive
       ${LE_ETC}/shell/zsh/completion
       $fpath)

prepends two directories to $fpath and indirectly $FPATH.

Perpend/append good; set bad.
