a normal guy wrote about Export problem:
:I think this is a bug.  Under HP-UX, the following line reports
:an error:
:% export RUN_DATE=`date +%Y%m%e%H%M.%S`
:zsh: not an identifier: 41211.52

Or maybe you want:
% export RUN_DATE="`date +%Y%m%e%H%M.%S`"

so that the space provided by %e doesn't cause word splitting.
