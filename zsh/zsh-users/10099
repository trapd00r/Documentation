Hi all,


i'm having some trouble using read to get a wrapped attrivute value of 
an ldif file :

say this text as stdin :

uid: suzan
description: R&D leader,
  doesn't know unix
  but skilled in C programming


the problem is that "while { read line }" will crunch the space at the 
begin of the line. I tried to find an appropriate flag in the doc. with 
no success, so i finally use " for line ( ${(f)"$(cat)"} )" ...

but ... i would like to know ... is there way to use read ?

regards,
mc
