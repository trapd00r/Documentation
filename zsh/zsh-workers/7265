We've had a lot of patches to -test-2.  I would think we should have a
period of no patches before we release 3.1.6.  This period of
stability ensures that we're all running with the same code.  Ideally, 
that period of stability would last several days and no bugs would be
reported against that release.  I would recommend releasing a -test-3
now with all applied patches.  I hope this code would end up being the 
3.1.6 release, but we won't know unless we're all starting from the
same page.
