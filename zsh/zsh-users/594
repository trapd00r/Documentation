I used term for some time. Actually, I rewrote term function to create
buffers with (default) names like *hostname.domain*<num>, so they were
easier to distinguish.

In fact, zsh works reasonably well in term-char-mode. That way I get
zsh's completions and zle. (Set TERM to vt100 :) In fact, even
programs like less work though it's somewhat silly to use them in
emacs buffer.

Pros: Get all output in emacs buffer automatically, and can use other
emacs facilities. In character terminal, no need to use screen.

Cons: At least in XEmacs-19.13/14 there was a bug in term; editing
multiline commands at the bottom of the emacs window caused an
error. (Hmm, couldn't reproduce it just now with XEmacs-20.0
beta. Looks like I might give it a try again...) If emacs is doing
something else, using term might be a bit difficult.

So run multiple emacsen? Quite heavy terminal emulators, though
there's no need to have a separate emacs for each shell :)

(I'll) have to rewrite my startup & wm stuff to make usual connections
through emacs - and use different ports for different gnuserv
processes.
