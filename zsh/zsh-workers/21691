Yes, that's what's happening, as is explained in zsh FAQ #2.3, except
that it's a mistake to call it "re-writing."

The discussion of aliasing in the zsh manual says "Every token in the
shell input is checked ..." -- note that it says token, indicating that
aliasing is applied after lexical analysis, and that it specifically
does not say anything about requiring spaces to surround the token.
