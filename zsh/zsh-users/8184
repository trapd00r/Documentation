They're checked when the zsh/zle module is loaded.  That means they have
to be set before the first time you invoke a bindkey, zle, or completion-
related builtin, because any of those will autoload zle.

Some Linux distributions (and possibly other pre-packagings of zsh) have 
"bindkey -e" or the like in their /etc/z* files, which of course cause the 
settings of EDITOR and VISUAL to be ignored.  You're best off putting an 
explicit "bindkey -v" somewhere.
