The problem's not so much with the version of the shell (thought that may
have an effect) as with the version of fetchmail which is generating a help
string

  -a, --[fetch]all  retrieve old and new messages

which is confusing the shell.  This turns it into the options --fetchall
and --all, which seems to be the intention.  I don't know how common this
is; in principle you might get weird and wonderful syntax along those
lines, but I think we'll just have to wait and see.

> The _fetchmail seems to be obsolete.

I'm not sure what the point of having some arguments there but using --help
to get others is, but it might be for older versions of fetchmail.
