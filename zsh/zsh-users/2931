I'm reading the completion chapter at the moment, and it's excellent.
For all I know it might be completely wrong, but it's very clear and I
feel I'm beginning to understand this new completion stuff.  Once I
try it I may be in a position to notice mistakes, but in the meantime
I'd like to thank Peter for some of the best documentation I've read
in some time.
