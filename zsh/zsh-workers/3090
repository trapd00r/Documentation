Something to consider might be registering a unique domain name 
for the ZSH pages so when the website responsibility needs to change
hands, it isn't as painful.  No relearning is needed, the documentation 
and the search engines won't need updating, etc.  I can go a long way
to quell confusion.  Thats what we've done for Gnus (Emacs newsreader)
with `gnus.org'.  

Just something to think about.
