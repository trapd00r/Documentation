Hi, dear shell wizards.

I'm running zsh-3.1.6 and quite satisfied with it except for one
thing. Its about the default value of WORDCHARS which sets zle to skip 
most of the non-alphabetical characters in forward-word or
backward-word, just like limited express train (Shinkan-sen of Japan
or TGV of E.U.), very unlike other shells or emacsen behavior.
I hope the default value of it to be null, or is there some reason for 
this default value ?

regards.
