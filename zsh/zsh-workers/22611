Found it... and this time I more or less understood what it was doing.
I feel a little bit funny.

Actually, it's fairly obvious... printfmt() in zle_tricky.c() is even
documented(!) to return a number of lines, so dividing the return value
by the screen width is not the right thing to do.  Still took me two
days to find, though.

I have no idea why this didn't show up before; it appears the code has
always been like this.  Before I edited the line to try to get columns
right, it was last edited by Sven in 2000.

I'll add some commentary to complist.c if I can convince myself I've
worked out enough of what's going on.
