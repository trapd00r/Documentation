I would like to request a one-word change to the zshexpn man page.

Towards the end of the 'HISTORY EXPANSION' section, there is a
sentence which is slightly ambiguous. While one interpretation makes
less sense than the other, it would be nice to have the following
change:

Original text:

By default, a history reference with no event specification refers to
the same line as the <<<last>>> history reference on that command
line, unless it is the first history reference in a command.

Could the word 'last' on the second line be changed to 'previous'?

Also, since I'm not on the workers list, could someone please respond
directly to me? Thanks.
