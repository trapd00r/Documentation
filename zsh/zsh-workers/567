It is not related to zsh but you may be interested.

The 5.7 version of GNU rcs is available sice June.  It puts the file
name in the diff headers it produces so the output can be used as a
patch without an index line.  The headers it produces looks like this:

*** zsh.h       1995/10/30 06:24:02     1.1
--- zsh.h       1995/11/07 18:11:58     1.2

This makes it easier to produce patches from rcs.

For this to work diff must support the -L option (GNU diff supports it).

Cheers,

  Zoltan
