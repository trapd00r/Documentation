Not really.  The hgets -> ingets change happened last august.  And hgets
used hgetch instead of hgetc.  The real change compared to the 2.5 version
is using hgetc instead of hgetch.  The difference is that hgetch has
nothing to do with the history code while hgetc updates chline.  So the
name ingets was correct.  But now I'll perhaps completely remove hgets and
merge it into gethere since it is only called from there and it seems that
the code would be simpler if hgets were merged into gethere.
