} How can we do that?  I mean, how will zpathmax know what parts to
} lop off, if any?

It can just keep lopping the tail as long as (errno == ENOENT ||
errno == ENOTDIR), I think.  There are some special cases involving paths
that contain "../" that I'm a bit worried about, but I think most of
those (and paths with lots of consecutive slashes) would fail zsh's
constant-PATH_MAX tests already in boundary cases, so probably nothing
will become broken that wasn't already.
