} what?

Same thing happens for "done", "esac", "else", "fi", and "end".  These
are reserved words that cannot appear in command position, so although
the syntax error is reported as being "near ;" the real error is before
the command even gets started, and hence there's nothing to put into
the history.

This also happens for "}".
