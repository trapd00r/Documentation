} I'm now completely convinced that the two are connected, and that testing
} for (st->list != NULL) is not a sufficient fix.

I've traced this to the point where parse.c:bld_eprog() does something
horribly wrong when handed a parse consisting of nothing but NULLTOK,
and now I'm beyond my understanding of what's supposed to be going on.

However, it sure looks like a bad interaction between the trap scoping
mechanism and eprogs for functions with empty bodies.
