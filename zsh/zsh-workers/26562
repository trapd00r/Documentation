Well, obviously, that's what the rest of us are here for. :-)

} I suspect the answer's no, but I don't understand the internals and

} handled.

I think the only ways to execute a .zwc are with autoload and "." --
to run FILE.zwc with "." you have to use ". FILE" (omit extension).

The state of the autoload -U and -z flags are stored in the .zwc so I
thought that might mean some of the shfunc was packed there and thus
the sticky setting would get picked up as a side-effect, but that does
not appear to be the case.
