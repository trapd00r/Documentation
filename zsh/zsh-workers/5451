That header is coming from the libxg-dev package, described as "graphics 
libraries from plan 9."  That package isn't part of the default install, 
but it is available as part of the stable release.  You could try a 
"dpkg --purge libxg-dev" to get rid of it.

The moron that came up with the idea was Raul Miller <moth@debian.org>.  
You should file a Debian bug against the package -- having that 
incompatible libc.h in /usr/include just seems broken.

In any case, since the header can appear in stable release Debian 
systems, a fix to zsh seems warranted.
