} I'm trying to see if the value of a parameter contains a given string

The right-hand-side of == in a [[ ]] construct is a glob pattern, so if
all you want is true/false, this works:

    if [[ $foo == *pattern* ]]; then
 	# contains pattern
    else
 	# doesn't contain pattern
    fi

If you want to extract the matching string, see the M and S flags:

    matching=${(SM)foo##pattern}
