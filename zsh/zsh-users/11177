See 'man zshbuiltins' (the 'typeset' builtin, '-T' option).

Example:

[snip]
# 3rd arg. to typeset -T is optional (default ':').
typeset -T string array ':'
string="one:two:three:four"
array+=five
print -l $array
[snap]

That is not exactly converting. It is more a way to connect a string
to an array, just as with the $PATH and $path or $FPATH and $fpath
parameters.
