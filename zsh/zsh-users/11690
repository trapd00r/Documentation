Subject: shared directory stack?

Hi folks:

Is there a way to have a shared directory stack among a bunch of  
shell sessions, in a way analogous to shared history in zsh?

I have implemented something hackish, and have been using it with  
success for awhile, but I worry that there is a simple, elegant way  
in zsh, since there is for almost everything else hackish that I have  
implemented.

Thanks.

Bill Scott
