Impossible (unless you either unset it yourself or have very broken
version). (Value of) IFS is used to split input line into words in some
contexts; I am sure about `read' builtin and possibly some others
(select?). By default it is set to space, TAB and LF for sure; I am not
sure if \0 is Zsh extension (anybody cares to lookup in SUS?)

>=20

Zsh itself does not depend on its value. But you may have some scripts
that expect it to contain \0.=20
