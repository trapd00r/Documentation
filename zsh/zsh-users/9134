    Hi all :) and sorry for self-replying...

    I've written a not very good solution that at least works:

function shuffle () {

    emulate -L zsh 
    
    setopt nullglob globdots rcexpandparam
    
    RANDOM=`date +%s`
    [[ $# -eq 0 ]] && set '*'

    reply=($~*(e:'REPLY="${(l.5..0.)RANDOM} $REPLY"':))
    reply=(${(o)reply})
    reply=(${reply/#????? /})

    print -l $reply

    return 0
}
alias shuffle="noglob 'shuffle'"

    The function returns the list in the 'reply' array parameter, and
prints it on stdout.

    If anybody can make it better/shorter, suggestions are welcome ;)
The three array assignments can be probably shortened.
