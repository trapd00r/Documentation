It's set up that way so that backward-kill-word will behave like the BSD
tty driver werase character (see "stty -a").

You'll notice that backward-kill-word is bound to ctrl-W by default, which
is also not loke emacs but is compatible with the default stty setting for
werase.

Zsh makes the assumption that most people who first try it are used to using
a dumb shell, not a smart editor, and that the people who do know how to use
a smart editor can figure out how to make zsh do what they want.
