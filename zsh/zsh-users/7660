Asynchronous notifications are currently set up to go direct to the
terminal.  It's actually the duplicated fd used for terminal handling
rather than stdout, but they're typically the same unless you try to
redirect stdout.

I think this is probably because you don't usually want asynchronous job
notifications mixed in with other error text, since they're nothing to
do with what's actually running: job control is specifically interactive.
Note that the interaction with the terminal output is inevitable, that's
why you get the editing buffer cleard and the prompt reprinted
afterwards.  I don't think you can redirect them without messing up
terminal editing.
