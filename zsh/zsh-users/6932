What's odd about this is, of course, that '.pl' was never an extension that
meant "perl script" -- it was always "perl library" in just the way that
".pm" is now used for perl modules.  But windows couldn't function without a
canonical extension name and so that little detail has been lost in the
hoary mists of time....

William,
I find it useful to see the .pl extension.

It's a "windows" thing to set PathExt thus

echo $PATHEXT

I'm sure I had it working before
