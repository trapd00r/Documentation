} The advantage of a "zsh." prefix is that *nothing* currently relies
} on such a variable name existing or behaving in any particular manner,
} whereas "ZSH_" names are defined by POSIX to have no special semantics.

Are there any "available" names in the POSIX space?

The problem with introducing an incompatible syntax in order to escape
POSIX is that you can't reliably export variables with the new names.
I've used versions of sh that would mangle the environment and/or issue
warning messages if there were any strings present where the stuff to
the left of the `=' contained characters other than [A-Z][a-z][0-9]_.
