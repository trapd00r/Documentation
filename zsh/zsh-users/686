By default, zsh's behaviour is not completely compatible with sh.  If
you want to just run a sh script under zsh, put the command "emulate
sh" at the beginning of the script, and it should work.  If you'd
rather rewrite the script to do things the zsh way, you should use
arrays throughout for storing lists of filenames.
