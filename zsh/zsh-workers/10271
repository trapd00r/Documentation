I seem to remember that before, this left normal completion to go on but from tracing _expand, it seems to be trying to expand the ~ but not working. What should happen here - I'd prefer normal completion but at the very least, it should expand ~ and allow completion to carry on after that.

Hm. There was a problem with the call to _requested, making it spew
out a warning (and the other hunk fixes the suffix handling). But I
got the original and the expanded ~ all right.
