Incredible. This is one more thing I was tempted to ask for ... but I always
thought it was impossible :-)

Small problem - after I type the second character, new list is not redisplayed
(no list is actually displayed):

(this is after 'ls Meta-x incremental-complete-word'
bor@itsrm2:~/test/i-c-w%> ls
incremental completion...
abc   acd

now I press ``a'':

bor@itsrm2:~/test/i-c-w%> ls a<=Cursor here
incremental completion...

If I press TAB I get correct list. If I now press the next character I get

bor@itsrm2:~/test/i-c-w%> ls ab
incremental completion...
abc

list is displayed again.

Completion settings:

compconf correct_accept='2n'
compconf match_original='yes'
compconf completer='_complete:_match'
compconf dumpfile='/home/bor/.zcompdump'
compconf path_cursor='yes'
compconf match_insert='unambig'
compconf correct_prompt='correct to:'
