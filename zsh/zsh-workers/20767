Yes, that's about the only sensible way it can work, as far as I can
see.  If instead of a shell module it's an argument or output to an
external command, this is the way it needs to work.

Yes, someone has to test at some point.  I don't think the shell's
internals have enough information.  We *could* bind
(multibyte-?)self-insert to high-eighth-bit characters in UTF-8 locales
by default, I suppose.

I think this relates to the same issue as input from .zshrc, i.e. a
binary stream which has to be dealt with by whatever receives it.
Again, to the extent that the shell doesn't need to process the string
this ought to be OK.
