Subject: PATCH: alter _all_matches example in docs

This is a very small change to an example usage of _generic in the
documentation. It makes the context for setting the completer more
specific. The trouble was that I used ':completion:*::::' for my main
completer style's context so it took precedence and it all didn't
work. This just makes it less likely that someone else makes the same
mistake.

I also just finally worked out that using * for the second (function)
part of the context for my ignored-patterns and ignore-line styles was
the cause of my _match based widget not working half the time.
