Both behaviours are useful.  What would really be nice would be to
make the delimiter a glob pattern, so that both behaviours (and more)
are available.  That would make the default behave the way you want it,
which is probably better overall, because if one really wanted the other
form of splitting then this would become immediately obvious.
