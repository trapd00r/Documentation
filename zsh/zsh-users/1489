I will go through them and fix the errors etc (actually, I'm working
on this right now. The current pages is just a copy of the old ones).

I do hope, that other people will step forward and help maintain the
pages. If any of you would like to give a hand on this project, then
please let me know in private mail. 

Best,
Karsten
