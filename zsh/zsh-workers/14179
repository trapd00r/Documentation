Direct hit :)

Bad luck that this is the wrong way to figure that out ;)

Yes.

But another question:
How do I redirect some fds and still get them to the screen?
With the multios option, I can do things like
foo >x >y >z | grep something
But how do I do
foo >x >y >z=20
and still get stdout to stdout?
Of course, for stdout,
foo >x >y |tee z
works; but how do I get this to work for stderr?
