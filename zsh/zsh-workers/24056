%N seems reasonable, although I'm wondering if we might actually be
better off with a specification for floating point seconds; we could
then use the same thing in zsh/datetime where we only get microsecond
resolution from gettimeofday().  Either way, it would probably be good
to add this to ztrftime() and expand the interface to include a
(possibly NULL) pointer to whatever gives the extra resolution.  Would
it be too horrible to allow formats like "%.9s"?  We'd have to restrict
it to %S and %s which are the only two where it makes sense, and we
would have to decide what to do about E and O modifiers and glibc flag
additions; simply passing them straight through and not allowing a
fractional second in such cases would probably be good enough.
