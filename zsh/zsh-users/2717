Subject: How to do completion with read?
X-Mailer: VM 6.74 under Emacs 20.4.1
Mime-Version: 1.0 (generated by tm-edit 7.106)
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

Is there a way to use completion mechanism when prompt user for input
in zsh function/scripts?  For example,

echo -n "Enter choice: "
read -C '-k "(orange apple banana)"' choice

The example about use imaginary option '-C' which tell zsh to pass the
next argument as compctl argument.

Any help will be appreciated...
