Right, I was had a self-written tool named pstruct, sorry that that
slipped in.

Ah, the pbm stuff...

This is a first simple solution. Now I'm thinking aabout chaging the
uses of _compskip so that one can say `do not try any other completion
function' (like we have it now), but can also say `use a completion
function defined for the command itself, but don't use -default-'.
Then we can give some of these commands their own functions, too.

Bye
 Sven
