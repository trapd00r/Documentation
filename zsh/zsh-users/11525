I assume you are using the "new" completion system (it's not so new now).

You can make the *entire* completion system do this by putting
the following code in your initialisation file after you run "compinit":

_comp_options+=(globdots)

If your version of the shell is before 4.2, you might need to expand that:

_comp_options=($_comp_options globdots)

This will make the completion system complete files beginning with dot
in every single place it possibly could.  I don't think there's an easy
way of restricting the effect.  However, as you wanted, it won't affect
the use of globbing ("*" etc.) on the command line.
