} How easy is it to package up modules separately in such a way that they
} could be built and installed without needing to be unpacked over the zsh
} source and compiled with it.

Not very easy, unfortunately.  The zsh.mdh file includes all the .epro
files, which are generated during the zsh build and may differ among
operating systems.

} Ideally, we would have a set of include
} files which was all anyone needed to build a separate zsh module.

That could work, but only for modules that didn't need to reference any
of the external symbols other than addbuiltin() etc.  That's a pretty
small subset of the current crop of modules.
 
} Does anyone remember what happened to the perl module someone posted
} quite a while back?

The URL was

    http://www.phydeaux.org/perl/zperl-0.01.patch.gz

I haven't looked to see if it's still there.
