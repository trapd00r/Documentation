Anybody who fiddles with configure.in^H^Hac should be prepared to deal with
(in-)compatibilities so it is not really a question. It is 500KB and needs
just GNU m4 to run.

Yes, I have not thought about it. This is the real argument. Even Mandrake
cooker has not dared to update to 2.50 yet. Still, I do not speak about
4.0.x - it will remain as is. I speak about 4.1.x that is development
version anyway.

No I do not push it. 2.50 is nice and more clean and some tasks can be
implemented in much more natural way but there is nothing really pressing.

So, I'm personally inclined to implement Bart's idea for 4.0.x and redesign
for 2.50 in 4.1.x at some point near 4.1.1.
