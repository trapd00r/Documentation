Why are you being so pedantic?  Should I have said `input' rather than
`insert'?  Why is it then that if I do :se showmode it says `insert'?
What's wrong with saying movement doesn't `work'?

What terminology could I have used that wouldn't have irked you? 

Anyway, there is such a thing as an insert `mode', I have the sources
from Bill Joy and Mark Horton's ex version 3 and there are plenty of
references to insert mode (it's a terminal attribute) and the Vim
sources use this term in exactly the way I do. So there! (sticks out
tongue).

Thanks for the help anyway.
