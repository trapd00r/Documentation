If it were, say, a glob modifier, then it could be documented to mean
"anything not a glob with this modifier will be repeated" -- that should
cover the majority of the situations and be a clear enough trade-off.

If it's a pre-command modifier, then it would simply be "anything not a
glob is repeated".

Ie "don't mix specified files and globs which might be repeated".
