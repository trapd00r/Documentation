I would vote for this format for credited contributions. By putting the
name before message numbers, it can be inferred that the first message
number was by whomever committed the change without their having to
repeat their own name. First names only should be suffcient for the
usual suspects (as is common at the moment) and e-mail addresses are
perhaps more information than anyone will ever use.

Here, it looks like the contributed change was modified slightly in a
way that is too insignificant to post. So we need a way to cover this.

Splitting these as per the example more often is perhaps a good idea
then.

My votes here are for wrapping so the maximum line is 79 characters. No
newline after the colon unless it could only be followed by about one
word before wrapping at the line end, no initial capitalisation to
avoid the temptation to capitalise the first letter of a function name.
If we don't capitalise, then no final full-stop for consistency with
that. As you say though, these issues are less significant so I don't
care much and will happily defer to anyone else's suggestions.

We could also agree on the format of notes added to cvs - some notes
are preceded by the message number and a colon while others are
followed by the message numbr in brackets.
