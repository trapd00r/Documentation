} 2.10. We should then mention somewhere that one needs at least version 
} <whatever> somewhere.

Two responses:

(1) I've forgotten where those filenames starting with `!' are used, and
there's no mention of it in INSTALL or Etc/zsh-development-guide, nor in
"configure --help" output, nor any of the other obvious places I looked.
Will somebody who does remember what it means please document it?

(2) Relying on the ability to edit config.status is bad news to begin with.
There must be some other way to deal with this?
