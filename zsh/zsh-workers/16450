Only half a dozen years since we switched to sending replies to the originator
instead of the list, so I haven't quite got the hang of it yet...

It's easy (almost trivial, if I've got it right) to fix, but it might cause
other problems --- there may be cases when you don't want anything before
the qualifiers to be indentified as a qualifier.  The usual difficulty is
the other way round --- you want to suppress all qualifiers --- but I'm not
entirely happy with changing it.

It could be controlled by an option, of course.  Turning it on just for the
completion code probably wouldn't be too hairy.

Here's the patch, which I won't commit.
