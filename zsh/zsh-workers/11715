Subject: Array slices (PWS's unposted Etc/NEWS change)
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

 - Array slices ${array[a,b]} with b < a now correctly have zero length.

This isn't an accurate description.  The patch makes ${array[a,0]} have zero
length, for any value of a, unless ksharrays is set.  Previously $array[1,0]
behaved like $array[1,1], which was not the same as any other value of a.

Unfortunately (?) that means $array[0,0] != $array[0].  I'm not sure whether
that's likely to break anything.

That patch has also caused the failure in the last example here:
---------------------------
zagzig% foo=(a b c d e f g)
zagzig% echo $foo[1,4]
a b c d
zagzig% echo $foo[1,-4]
a b c d
zagzig% echo $foo[4,1]

zagzig% echo $foo[-4,1]
d e f g
---------------------------

Yowtch.
