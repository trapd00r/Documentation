That won't wrap on most terminals, so you'd have to do something like
this:

    repeat $(( $COLUMNS - 2 )) echoti cuf1
    echo -n '  '

However, that puts one or two spaces into the end of the line, so it
may not change the copy behavior that Bart was complaining about (my
terminal program doesn't behave the way Bart's does, so I don't know
if that's any better or not -- probably not).
