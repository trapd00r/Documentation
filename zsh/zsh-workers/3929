It was always documented as working on names of existing files.
It's useful functionality, of course, but...

But this is more meaningful, and how often are you actually applying
qualifiers to a literal string rather than a $ expansion?

I'm trying to keep this as simple and orthogonal as possible.  (:quals)
is part of the glob syntax, and ${:quals} is part of the parameter
expansion syntax.  The latter is the proper syntax for manipulation
arbitrary strings.

Good point.  I'll change this back.
