Patterns would need to be array-based rather than hash-based.  That way
you don't get a hit if you don't have any pattern aliases.  It's not
at all technically difficult to add.  I think we need suffix aliases for
efficiency anyway.

It would be useful when trying to output existing messages.  I'm a bit
bemused why _aliases goes to all that trouble of sorting aliases into
type but _alias doesn't use it.
