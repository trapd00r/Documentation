I think to be a little blunt about it it boils down to.. which is more
important, keeping the loyal users who are actually subscribed and asking
not to receive a bunch of silly SPAM or making sure that Joe Schmoe can 
post freely?

I've enjoyed this list a great deal - I think there are some really cool
and some extremely smart people on here. But alas, I'm unsubscribing myself
and will resort to browse whatever archives on occasion instead.
