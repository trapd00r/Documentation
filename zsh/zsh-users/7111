Hi folks,

Right after I updated my zsh to 4.1.1-1 (from Debian), tab completion
for command arguments stopps working, with error messages like this:

_normal:23: command not found: _set_command
_normal:25: command not found: _dispatch

I guess it may be a packaging problem, but failed to google out anything
useful.

Any hint folks?

Thanks in advance~~
