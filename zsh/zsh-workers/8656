I wrote the original *_accounts and for what it's worth, yes, I think
that would be very nice indeed; in fact I was very tempted at the time
to implement configurability similar (in principle at least) to this,

I'm saving all your recent _tags changes and I will go through them
when I get the time, I promise :-)  I'm looking forward to getting my
teeth into some obviously juicy improvements.  From reading some of
your pleas for feedback, I imagine it must feel like you're
simultaneously talking to Bart and a brick wall at the moment ;-)
