The code that handles quotes in completion is gruesome (and includes, in
case you hadn't guessed, the most horrible function ever written,
too---that's the one that deals with nested quotes when something inside
quotes is to be treated as a command line in its own right).  One of its
tricks is that it makes some kind of guess early on how to quote the
line.  If there's a ' at the start it will use ' quoting and if there
isn't it will use backslash quoting.  It doesn't make much attempt to
keep the form of quotes it started off with.  Typically this is a pretty
reasonable guess.

You'd see this if the test file was called \'foobar and you typed
'''f<TAB>.
