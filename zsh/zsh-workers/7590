I /think/ we had this question before. If enough people want this I
may try to do that.

And while we are at it... I still have a 2.4.180 version here with an
option named LIST_PACKED which made the columns of completion lists be 
shrunk to their minimal widths. Interesting to have when you have
lists with one one or two very long strings and lots of short
strings. In that case you get one or two wide columns and several
small ones -- dramatically reducing the number of lines needed.
