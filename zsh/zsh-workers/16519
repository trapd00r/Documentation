Subject: problems with RANDOM in subshells

One can work around the problem described below by doing

: $RANDOM ; (echo $RANDOM) | cat

Should the random-seeding behavior be changed for subshells?

----- Forwarded message from Falk Hueffner <falk@debian.org> -----

For each subshell, $RANDOM gets initialized to the same value, which
leads to the same sequence of random numbers.  This makes
e. g. playlist shuffling functions way boring, and is generally not
what one would expect.

falk@borkum:~% (echo $RANDOM) | cat

falk@borkum:~% (echo $RANDOM) | cat
12042
