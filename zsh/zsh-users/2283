} I beg to disagree.  Emacs's initialization is quite a bit simpler

Superficially, you're correct.  In practice, every autoloaded feature
does its own initialization at the time it's loaded, and any serious
user employs numerous hook functions and eval-after-load and so on to
interleave his own adjustments to that intialization.

Even for the simple case, though, there's system init both before and
after ~/.emacs ... but you can disable the "after" one, which is what
I've been saying should be possible with zsh too.

} These sound like ad-hoc hacks that more or less work in some specific cases.
} Very far from the kind of things you'd want to put in /etc/zshrc.

I agree about the EXINIT one.  Changing the prompt or $LESS is something
a sysadmin might do, even if you think he shouldn't.

} So you agree in a sense:  this fancy ordering is sometimes useful,
} but when it is, other alternatives would work as well.

What I disagree with about that is the "as well."  They'd work *also*,
but not *as well*.

} I'm all for a /etc/zshenv or maybe even more init files

Please, not more.
