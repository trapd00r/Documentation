} It doesn't use YYERROR* because it has to return NULL and we have
} YYERRORs only for void and integer, I think (I didn't change that
} part).

Zero is NULL, and NULL is zero.  Using YYERROR(0) would return NULL.

But perhaps a better question is: `tok' is a global, right?  Why not put
the `tok = LEXERROR' into yyerror() itself?
