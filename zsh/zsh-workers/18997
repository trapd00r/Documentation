I think you're right; there's no obvious way of getting this through the
Solaris sed in a single regexp.

sed -n -e 's/^#line[ 	].*\"\(.*\)\"/\2/p' \
       -e 's/^#[ 	].*\"\(.*\)\"/\2/p' |

should work.

I would think you need this for both signals (further up zshconfig.ac)
and errors --- probably it's only finding the signals owing to the
backup list of explicit files.
