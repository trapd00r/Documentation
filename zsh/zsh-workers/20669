} This seems like a reasonable complaint to me.  Is there a reason not to
} be more grid-like?

Sven's preference?

This statement is actually not quite correct:

} ----- Forwarded message from "Benjamin Hill (Mako)" <mako@debian.org> -----
} 
} This does not happen when the users is on first item in the first
} column. Pressing up from *this* item (and only this item) will take
} the users to the last item in the first (current) column.

I believe it actually goes to the last item in the *longest* column,
which happens always to be the first one.  The idea is to jump to the 
end of the *display*, not the end of the *list*, otherwise some items
"below and to the left of" the last item might not be visible when
the display is redrawn.
