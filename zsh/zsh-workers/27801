I can't think of anything that's changed that would have fixed this (but
it's been a long time now and we're due for another releases).  I won't
be doing any work on it until I get a reproducible case I can run.  It
sounds like it should be fairly trivial to fix if I can find out what
(misinterpreted) characters are causing a freeze at what point in the
code.
