OK, I worked this out now.  The problem is that there's no options tag *in 
the argument-rest subcontext* but there are both values and files tags, so 
the presence of values in this tag hides the files.  Sorry to be dense.

The canonical examples of _values are _dd and _chmod, neither of which 
allows ambiguity in whether an argument is a value or a filename (dd takes 
only values, and chmod requires exactly one value before any filename).  
So I suspect this simply never came up before.
