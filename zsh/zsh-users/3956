Subject: zsh 4.0.2 released
Date: Tue, 26 Jun 2001 15:57:36 +0100
From: Peter Stephenson <pws@csr.com>

I have finally succeeded in uploading zsh 4.0.2 to ftp.zsh.org and
sourceforge.  It will eventually reach the mirrors.

This is a maintenance release for the (stable) 4.0 branch.  Most of the
changes are bug fixes, including a fix for a bug which caused the test
suite to fail.  On fully supported systems, all tests should now pass.

There is one new feature:  the option KSH_TYPESET provides compatibility
with other shells for assignment arguments of `typeset', `export' and
related builtins.

(This is based on this morning's code.  Any later changes to the 4.0 branch
will not have been incorporated.)

One slight hickup is that the formatted HTML documentation in the zsh-doc
bundle doesn't use my hacked version of texi2html, which means there is no
pargraph formatting inside list items.  This makes the builtins manual
page, for example, look rather less neat.  I suspect this was the case with
4.0.1, however.
