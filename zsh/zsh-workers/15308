} ... all you need to do is fill up the history (so that event
} number 1 will fall off the saved lines) and then give the command `r = 1'.

Happens in 3.0.6 through 3.0.8 as well.  And -- good grief -- even in 2.4.
And the history number is a red herring: The loop appears to be attempting
to globally replace the empty string with the empty string, i.e. the `='
is being taken as a degenerate case of OLD=NEW.

Consequently, this should fix it:
