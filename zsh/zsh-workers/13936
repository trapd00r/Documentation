Sigh.  Bart's unposted change made one of the variables necessary in
the HAVE_TIGETSTR case, but I checked my change in before recompiling.
(Bad! Bad Wayne!)  I've fixed this in CVS.  The change looks like
this:

Index: Src/Modules/terminfo.c
@@ -30,10 +30,11 @@
 #include "terminfo.mdh"
 #include "terminfo.pro"

+static char terminfo_nam[] = "terminfo";

-static char terminfo_nam[] = "terminfo";
 static Param terminfo_pm;

 /* echoti: output a terminfo capability */

..wayne..
