I'm afraid that is not what the OP asked for.  What he is asking for
is this: vi *.txt<TAB> ...and then be dropped into a menu selection.

To do that at least this is needed:

[snip]
zmodload zsh/complist
autoload -U compinit && compinit
bindkey '^I' complete-word
zstyle ':completion:*' completer _expand _complete
zstyle ':completion:*' menu select yes
[snap]

That is the minimum. To further tweak the completion system there are
various documents that may help. I think a good starting point to
start learning-by-doing the completion system is the wiki¹, that holds
lots of examples² on how to customize compsys and how to get started
in the first place³ (if you don't use the compinstall function).
