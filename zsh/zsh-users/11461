ls *(u$UID)
lists only files owned by the user with uid=$UID (you can, of course,
replace $UID with a user id literal, like 0 for root)
or, for example
ls *(u:root:)
to list files given a user name rather than user id (the : is any
arbitrary separator that must be repeated at the end.)

See "Glob Qualifiers" in man zshexpn
