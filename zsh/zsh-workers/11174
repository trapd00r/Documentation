Unsetting PAGER runs it through `more' (obviously, default - but this
PAGER story is not documented anywhere). Setting PAGER=cat does the
trick ... almost. The problem is, now the ability to page output is
lost.

Hmm ... may be extend nslookup function in the same way (probably, using
style to turn it on/off)? If output has more lines than fit on screen,
run it through PAGER?
