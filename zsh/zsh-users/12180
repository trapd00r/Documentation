Right, there is no fortran-specific completion function,  I don't even
have the fortran compilers installed on any machine I work with, and I
suspect very few people on the zsh lists use fortran, so no one has been
motivated to create a completer for it.

If you can cause "f90.sh" to recognize a "--help" option and pass it
through to gfortran, you may be able to get away with

    compdef _gnu_generic gfortran f90.sh

The _gnu_generic completer tells completion to attempt to create a
completion by running the command with the --help option and parsing
the output.
