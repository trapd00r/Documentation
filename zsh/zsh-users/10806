 "Move command line options to start of line" (Oct  6,  4:07pm)

Nice, but not precisely what David Korn had in mind.  Given

zsh% ls -s file1 file2 -l

the result of the command should be

zsh% ls -s -l file1 file2

and not

zsh% ls -l -s file1 file2

I don't think this can be done without removing the trailing option and
its argument(s) from the line before finding the index of the place to
insert them again.  (Sufficiently deeply nested expansion might still
accomplish this in a single replacement.)
