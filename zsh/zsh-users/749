I can only confirm, that it happens. It happens with _rlogin_ (and not
with _rsh_). It is not limited to NeXT. I have two SVR4 based systems -
one is based on original SVR4.0.3 for i386 (SINIX-L), other on DC/OSx from
Pyramid (SINIX-N).

rlogin SINIX-N -> SINIX-L works O.K. 
rlogin SINIX-L -> SINIX-N shows the above problem. It is not always the
whole output lost - sometimes I see only the first line of `ls' output;
sometimes the `CR NL' after prompt is lost, that is:
% ls
 results in
% ls....... (first line of ls output).

It seems to depend on output size - `ls -l' have no problems.

`cat' OTOH works. 

I actually have no clues, except supposing some bugs in system. If anybody
have the ideas, how this could be debugged - much thanks in advance.

greetings
