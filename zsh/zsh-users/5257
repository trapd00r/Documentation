    Hi Oliver (Kiddle) :))

    Really, the patch is very small, and moreover Z sh is very well
coded (so it will difficult to bloat ;))))). Really, Zsh is not
bloated at all (IMHO), and the modular approach makes even more
difficult to bloat. For example, it has an ftp client, and if forced
it would be bloat (an ftp client on a shell...), but just making it a
module solves the problem. A very good job, indeed :)

    The 'printf' builtin of BASH gives an error if you print, for
example, '--'. It interprets it as an option given... SuSv3 says that
printf must print whatever you pass as parameter.

    But won't choke on 'printf --' ;)) And it's true, zsh 4.0.x
doesn't have a printf, sorry. Bad example chosen here O:)) It was
/bin/printf that was invoked, from sh-utils (that, BTW, aren't
compliant. It won't print '--help', for example.
