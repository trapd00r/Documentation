With the following aczshoot.m4 function (included from acinclude.m4)

AC_DEFUN(zsh_OOT,
[
AC_CHECK_HEADERS(stdarg.h varargs.h termios.h termio.h)

AC_TYPE_SIGNAL

AC_DEFINE([ZSH_OOT_MODULE], [], [Out-of-tree module])
])

and the following patch, the complete config.h is unnecessary.  The uuid
module doesn't need stdarg.h, varargs.h, termios.h, termio.h, or
RETSIGTYPE, however.  Any thoughts?
