Subject: Status of 4.1.x branch?

What's the status on a follow-on to 4.1.1?  I'm thinking of pushing for
4.1.1 to be integrated into Solaris (to replace 3.0.6 or whatever's
there currently), because it seems stable enough to be a win over 4.0.x,
but if there's going to be a new release soon, then I'd like to sit on
it until then.  (If there's a concern that 4.1.x isn't stable enough yet
for such a release, then I can push for 4.0.7 instead.)

Thanks,
Danek
