That's not up to the shell in that case. That's vi that opens
the "../file.txt" file and the shell has nothing to do with it.

What you could do is bind a zsh key that expands the
"../file.txt" to "~/somedir"

The confusing thing I find is that "cd" by default behaves
differently from other commands. That's because zsh maintains a
/logical/ current directory stored in $PWD and cd .. doesn't do
a chdir(".."), but just strips one trailing component off that
$PWD and does a chdir(of that). zsh can do if for cd because
it's zsh that does the cd.

You can disable that fancy behavior of cd, by doing a:

alias cd='cd -P'

Then if you have %~ is your PS1, you're least likely to have
surprises.
