I appreciate you telling me about this, even if it doesn't work
in current versions of zsh.  Thinking that such a specific feature
would, at best, be configurable with zstyle and not deemed worthy
of its own option, I didn't even bother with zshoptions(1).

But since the option actually /does/ exist, and is now known to be
broken, one might hope for a bugfix in the near future, right? :-)
