I am new here, and have nont had much experience with zsh. My question is
how do you record your history in a log file, so that the last 250
commands can be viewed by say, a sysop. I read the zshbuiltins man page,
and that said something about 'fc -A <log>', but i put that in my
.zlogout, and set the SAVEHIST=250, but it does nothing AFAIK.
Can someone help, please?
