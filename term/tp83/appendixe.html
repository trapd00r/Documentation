<P CLASS="chapterhead">Appendix E</P>
<H1 CLASS="chapterhead">Traditional Video Terminal Products</H1>
<P>This appendix offers a reference guide to Digital's earlier video terminals that have
been replaced by new products.</P>
<H2>VT52</H2>
<P>The VT52 is an upper- and lowercase ASCII video terminal whose display holds 24 lines
of 80 characters. The terminal features multikey rollover and keyclick.</P>
<P>The VT52 provides a two-way numeric keypad. In one mode, the keypad is used to generate
program-compatible numeric codes. If your application requires much numeric input, you can
use the VT52 without modifying hardware or software; or software can place the VT52 in the
alternate mode, in which each key on the keypad transmits a unique escape sequence. This
allows the host computer to distinguish between keys typed on the auxiliary keypad and
similar keys on the main keyboard. In this mode, each key on the keypad can be used to
invoke a user-defined function.</P>
<P>The VT52 has a wide range of cursor-positioning functions. As well as moving the cursor
one position in any direction, software can move the cursor to any position on the screen
with a Direct Cursor Addressing command that specifies the destination of the cursor. The
VT52 also offers fixed horizontal tabs, a Cursor-to-Home command, and two screen-erasure
functions. Data on the screen scrolls up when a linefeed function is performed with the
cursor on the bottom line. Data scrolls down when a reverse linefeed function is performed
with the cursor on the top line.</P>
<H2>VT55</H2>
<P>The VT55 is an on-line interactive video terminal. It serves as an alphanumeric, graph
drawing, and printer/plotter terminal. It can be used in plotting histograms, waveform and
peak analyses, data acquisition, monitoring, trending, simulation, and laboratory charts
and forms. The VT55 allows simultaneous display of any combination of text and graphics,
and supplies a hardcopy reproduction of the display screen for characters and graphs.</P>
<P>The VT55 can be used as a 24-line programmer's terminal, using only alphanumeric
capability with the console keyboard and keypad. The VT55 is packaged in a compact desktop
cabinet, and information is displayed on a 12-inch CRT.</P>
<P>The copier option uses a scanning technique similar to methods used in facsimile
picture transmission systems. This technique, in conjunction with the use of modern
recording paper, generates high-quality copy in a small package with a minimum of moving
parts.</P>
<P>For most applications, the VT55 will be interfaced to a host computer with a serial
line cable and operated in full-duplex communication mode. Data transmitted by the VT55
is received by the host computer. Data received by the VT55 is determined solely by the
host computer.</P>
<P>The VT55 may also be set to local mode or to full-duplex with local copy mode of
operation. The latter is useful when the host computer does not generate an immediate
echo or response to a keyboard transmission, and a visual verification of the
information being sent is desired.</P>
<P>The VT55 is capable of sending and receiving at rates from 75 to 9600 bits per
second. Data is sent in serial digital format for the 20mA interface models. The EIA
interface models allow the use of the VT55 with RS232-C signals.</P>
<P>VT55 models with Mate-N-Lok connectors are primarily intended for interfacing with 20mA
digital serial line communications interfaces. Units with RS232-C connectors are
compatible with RS232-C Standard Data Phone and modem connectors. Connector 283B is a
telephone-type plug compatible with DECsystem-10s.</P>
