That is very bad. It most probably means, we still need export files but
they are not created while we think we are on "normal" OS and not on AIX :-0
If it is the case, it may be fixed - unfotunately, we need to know the
format of exports file.

Please, give it a try - create export file for zsh and add it to rlimits,
like:

add ``-bE:zsh.export'' to libzsh flags
add ``-bI:../zsh.export'' to rlimits.so flags (ajust path as appropriate)
try to compile

And as long as you are the only person who has access to AIX - could you
check compiler docs how to generate shared library on your version of AIX?
