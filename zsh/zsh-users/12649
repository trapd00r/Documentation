Except it's not the relevant portion.

If you diff your old and new files, you'll find the new one has
alwayslastprompt explicitly turned off.  This is the option that allows
the shell to use terminal handling to display the list below your prompt
and then return to the same prompt.  You need this for menu selection.

Turn it back on again.
