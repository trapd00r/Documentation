I know, pws-18 is out, but there is nothing that mentiones similar problem
there:

bor@itsrm2:/tools/src/zsh-3.1.5-pws-17/Completion%> zsh -f
itsrm2% fpath=($PWD/*)
itsrm2% . Core/compinit
itsrm2% compconf correct_accept='2n'
itsrm2% compconf match_original='yes'
itsrm2% compconf completer='_complete:_match'
itsrm2% compconf dumpfile='/home/bor/.zsh.d/Completion/Core/compinit.dump'
itsrm2% compconf correct_prompt='correct to:'
itsrm2% cd /a1/Microsoft/IE5/IE5.0 Security Updates/
itsrm2% cd /a/M/I/I<TAB>
itsrm2% cd /a1/Microsoft/IE5/IE5.0 Security Updates/
                                  ^        ^

blanks are not quoted. Builtin completion is O.K.
