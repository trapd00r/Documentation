Subject: _expand doesn't do brace expansion?
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

This is with all the latest patches (up to 11910):

zagzig[35] ls Functions/{Misc,Prompts}<TAB>
Completing `file' or `corrections'(BEEP)
zagzig[35] ls Functions/{Misc,Prompts}<C-x e>
(BEEP)
zagzig[35] ls Functions/{Misc,Prompts}<M-x expand-or-complete RET>
zagzig[35] ls Functions/Misc Functions/Prompts

The test on line 85 is making it bail out early, but even with that test
removed it doesn't expand the braces.
