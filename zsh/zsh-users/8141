    Hi Bart :)

    Given the possibility of -K to compctl I think I will never need
-x. Moreover, the syntax of -x is arcane, ok, but the things you must
do in order to make compadd work as desired is even bigger.

    I know, the work is already done, but using a thing as big and
complex as the function system provided with zsh makes me feel...
weird. For me compctl is cosier (if such a word exists in english).

    I've written half a dozen of compctl commands (more or less)
since my first message and I think I already have the completion
system as I like it. Obviously, there is no reason for me to use
compsys. In fact, compinstall will need more of my time than writing
a couple more compctl commands, even if complex ones.

    I haven't found any bug in compctl yet, although I haven't been
using it for a long time. Anyway, I've got a segfault with compadd...
surely fixed in 4.1.x and higher.

    Thanks for your advice, Bart, you're great :)
