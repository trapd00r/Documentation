Actually, that's not quite true.

`[' works like a command, thus =3D=3D is seen like it is for any other
command too. And in those cases, the leading equal leads to expansion of
the corresponding program's full path. For example

zsh% print =3Demacs
/usr/bin/emacs

Now, there is no command "=3D" on your system, which is why you're getting
the correct message "=3D not found". To prevent this, you can either unset
the `EQUALS' option (man zshoptions | less -p EQUALS) or quote the
string that is otherwise subject to this expansion. As in:

       if [ 'abc' '=3D=3D' 'def' ]; then
