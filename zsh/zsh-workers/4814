} Thanks for the help, I searched but didn't find modentry.c.

The modentry.c file has never appeared in an "official" distribution as
far as I can tell.  It was a new file when I did my "cvs import" of
3.1.5-pws-3.  So if you're working strictly from patches and not from
Peter's tarball, you won't have modentry.c.
