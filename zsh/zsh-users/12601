Also useful, but for a different reason, is "man 7 ascii", which will
show which control key combinations are indistinguishable from special
keys to the shell, like ctrl-i and tab, ctrl-m and enter, etc.
Wouldn't want to accidentally bind ctrl-m to something, you'd have a
tough time changing it back without an enter key.  ;)
