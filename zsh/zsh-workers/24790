It appears a newline is needed between the . and the ), or the output becomes:
  These characters are described below..'
same for these parts
`tt(^)' followed by the base character.)
on the operating system.)


The region hilighting acts a bit odd for me, if I type 'hello' press
ctrl-space and go left, everything appears fine until the cursor
reaches the "e", at this point the "h" is also hilighted. Tried in
urxvt and xterm, with zsh -f, with the same result. Going back and
forth seems to leave some characters hilighted too.

Other than that, this seems really nice. :)
