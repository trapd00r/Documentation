On second thoughts, scratch that.  It's almost certainly echo that's
translating '\\' to '\'.  So the advice is, don't configure 3.1.3 with
a SysV sh.  zsh and bash will both work as intended (if invoked as sh).

Temporary fix: in the ed input in configure.in, change each '\' to '#',
and change ') | ed' to ') | sed s/\#/\\\\/g | ed'.  I'll produce a proper
patch when I have a chance to analyse it more thoroughly.
