Of course, since you didn't make a release and then immediately leave
town, Sven had to fill the gap by introducing a bug and then leaving town.

We do have a history of making a release and then quickly making another
with only the dates changed (not the version).

Unfortunately I can't tell whether this test failure is an actual bug,
or an intentional change in behavior.  The next test chunk fails as well:
