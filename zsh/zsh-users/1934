Hi,

I've upgraded from zsh 3.0.5 to try zsh 3.1.5 and I noticed two
problems.

The new zsh seems to have problems with files whose name contains
non ASCII characters:

skiff:~/tmp> cat généalogie 
zsh: command not found: alogie

The error message is quite weird...

Other problem, I've mapped the up and down arrows to the
up-line-or-search and down-line-or-search functions (which I find
quite useful):

bindkey '^[[B'  down-line-or-search
bindkey '^[[A'  up-line-or-search

but the arrow keys then don't work anymore.

These two problems doesn't exist in zsh 3.0.5.
