If I use xterm or rxvt, I do so using the ssh's X forwarding capability
(ssh creates a proxy server on the server side and forwards the connection
through a crypted channel to the client's X server.)
 
I have also logged in with ssh from a xterm running on the client side.

Using any of these method, the problem appear similarly.

For security reasons, that is the only way to connect the server.

Yes.

The problem appears as before.

My mistake, that's clear when you read that sentence more carefully.

I guess so.

I have administrative privileges, and I've tried starting zsh straight
from /bin/zsh as part of the login process. I also tried executing the
newly compiled binary straight from the temporary directory.

I would also like to add that I tried removing my .zshrc, but the problem
still persisted. (I use the exact same .zshrc elsewhere, so I did not
imagine that to be the problem.)

That's what I would like to know, too...
