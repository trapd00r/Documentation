} This seems to only have an effect on globbing completions

That's the second time this summer I've misinterpreted that same
question.  (Which means the answer is in the zsh-users archives
from only a few weeks ago, if you had looked.)

Look up _all_matches in the manual.

          zle -C all-matches complete-word _generic
          bindkey '^Xa' all-matches
          zstyle ':completion:all-matches:*' old-matches only
          zstyle ':completion:all-matches::::' completer _all_matches
