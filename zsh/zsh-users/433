Hi all,

I must be doing something stupid, but has anyone successfully compiled
zsh using the HPUX ANSI C compiler?  Now that the cpp problem has been
fixed, I get about 160 warnings and errors from the compiler, and then
it exits.  There are lots of warnings about
"Integral value implicitly converted to pointer in assignment"

and about 30 errors like:

cc: "builtin.c", line 344: error 1588: "strpcmp" undefined.
cc: "builtin.c", line 344: error 1588: "invstrpcmp" undefined.
cc: "builtin.c", line 962: error 1588: "freestr" undefined.
cc: "builtin.c", line 2470: error 1647: Illegal integer-pointer
 combination for second and third operands of conditional expression (?:).
cc: "builtin.c", line 4047: error 1584: Inconsistent type declaration: "showlimits".
cc: "builtin.c", line 4097: error 1584: Inconsistent type declaration: "printulimit".

Has anyone else seen these errors? Is there a switch in the
compiler I need to include, or a patch for a compiler bug?
I just compiled using CC=cc and CFLAGS="-Aa -D_HPUX_SOURCE".  Same result for CFLAGS=-Ae.

Ideas?  Many thanks for any help. (I'm kind of surprised I'm having this
difficulty, since always before with the HPUX cc, I've had no problems with zsh)
