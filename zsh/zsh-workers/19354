I meant to forward this.  I can't see any any reason not to
apply the changes to the yodl files as given.

(My apologies if you get this twice.  My first run of sends had a bug.)

This is automatically generated email about problems in a man page for which
you appear to be responsible.  If you are not the right person or list, tell
me and I will attempt to correct my database.

See http://catb.org/~esr/doclifter/problems.html for details on how and
why these patches were generated.  Feel free to email me with any questions.

Problems with zsh.1:
1. Broken command synopsis syntax.  This may mean you're using a
construction in the command synopsis other than the standard
[ ] | { }, or it may mean you have running text in the command synopsis
section (the latter is not technically an error, but it's impossible
to translate into DocBook markup).
