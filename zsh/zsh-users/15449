Thanks for explaining. .oO(must read manual page harder ...)

Anyway, it does not work for me:

% screen -ls
There is a screen on:
	22789.ttys000.suck	(Attached)
1 Socket in /var/folders/zz/zzzivhrRnAmviuee+++2I+++-3+/-Tmp-/.screen.

% screen -S <tab>
session name

No session is displayed in the "session name" menu by the completion =
system. I have no customisation regarding screen in my configuration =
("zstyle -L | grep screen" is empty). I still must be doing something =
wrong here.
