No, that's not supposed to happen, unless you've rebound ^G to
self-insert or something.

That's also very odd.  As I said before, the only thing nobeep does is
control whether zsh outputs a ctrl-G character at certain times.  The
interpretation of that character is up to the terminal emulator and the
tty settings.

Unknown.  Check whatever the equivalent of /etc/profile is.

I haven't been able to get a system bell to ring on my newish PC since
the day I got it.  I don't know if the manufacturer failed to connect
something, or if gdm/Gnome is turning it off somehow ... and it hasn't
mattered enough to me to open the case to find out ...

Zsh behaves properly, though, as is obvious from the blinking if I turn
on the visible bell in the terminal emulator.
