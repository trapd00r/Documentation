  insert-tab
  
       The default value of this style is `true' unless when completing
       inside the vared builtin command, where it defaults to `false'.

This appears to be `untrue'.  You need to set it to use it.  I don't know
which is right.  It seems to work if I redefine complete-word as a trivial
widget which runs zle .complete-word.

By the way, I was having some problem with another apparently trivial
widget, expand-or-complete() { zle .expand-or-complete; }, which frequently
made the shell crash.  Unfortunately, it doesn't do this with the default
settings and I haven't traced what was doing it.
