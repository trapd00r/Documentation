} Are we going to do this?

I don't see any harm in it, but I have one last question ...

In looking at the code earlier in this function, I find that it's zsh
that does (the equivalent of) val |= 0200 before testing (val & 0200).
This makes me wonder if we should be using (val & ~0200) rather than
WTERMSIG(val) here.
 
} +		if ((val & 0200) && inforeground == 1 &&
} +		    (WTERMSIG(val) == SIGINT || WTERMSIG(val) == SIGQUIT)) {

It *probably* doesn't matter either way ...
