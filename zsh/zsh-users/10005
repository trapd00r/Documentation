The syntax you're showing only works if the ^[ is a real escape
character and ^G a real control-G:  "print -P" doesn't handle the ^ in
the way that bindkey does.  Maybe you copied this in some way as to turn
it into the characters you've shown?  (The terminal will represent
the characters in the way you've shown on output the same in either
case.)

It's safer to use:

chpwd() { print -Pn '\e]2;%~\a' }

However, this hasn't actually changed since 4.2; I tried 4.0.7 and 4.2.2
and they behaved the same way.
