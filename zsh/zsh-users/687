Hi Andrej,

thanks a lot for your answer!

> Crude answer is - read the FAQ.

I would have loved to; however I couldn't find out if and where one  
exists. Could you give me a pointer?

> PS and, please, try to read manuals first next time.

Acutally, I have read the manpage a hundred times, but all of the  
solutions you mention are not included in it. It was the only  
documentation available on my machine, and the only pointer to more  
information given in the manpage was the mailing list.

So, sorry for bothering you - I didn't know of another way.

And thanks again!


                Tschau
                        Uli
