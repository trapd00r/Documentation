To make xterm start a login shell, use
xterm -ls

However, on a semantics note, the files that are only run on login are
only run once for a reason: they're doing one-shot initialization like
setting up the path, ssh-agents, etc.  So, running that stuff once per
shell is not really the way to go.  Instead, you probably want to look
into making sure that your window manager begins its session from a
login shell.
