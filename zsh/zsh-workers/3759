Hello all!

Trying to compile zsh-3.0.5 an a Reliant UNIX 5.43 box I found the following
problem:
    gettimeofday() accepts just a singe parameter in case you don't
    define the _XPG_IV preprocessor symbol

 
Beside this little problem 'zsh' compiled out of the box.

When playing around with it I found my profile not to work as I expected. The
problem is, that lines like

  q=$(echo Hello)

don't work. The value of 'q' is empty.

Michael.
