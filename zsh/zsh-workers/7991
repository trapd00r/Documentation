Hello:

FYI, I'm using zsh-3.1.6.

I decided to change my script to reflect the copy of my shell, and attempt
to direct it to the path of my zsh wrapper itself causes the script to
misfire when it is executed from *csh.  I've narrowed it down to a machine
independent wrapper I have which seems to be hampering starting the
interpreter.  It is:

#!/bin/sh

if [ -f $OTOOLS/bin/$OS/zsh ]; then
  exec $OTOOLS/bin/$OS/zsh $*
else
  exec /usr/intel/bin/zsh $*
fi

Is this the most robust way to handle this?

-Clint
