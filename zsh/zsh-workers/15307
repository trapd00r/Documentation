} Honestly speaking, I never liked it (function defining other functions that
} is); why not simply have them autoloaded is beyond me.

In the case of compdef I agree with you -- it's complicated enough that it
should have an entry in the documentation (separate from the `#comdpef'
entries, which are deceptively similar but use slightly different syntax).

In other cases functions defining functions is quite appropriate; consider
the `compadd' front-end that's defined in _approximate or _complete_help.
Not only would it be a waste to put it in a separate file, it would cause
errors to locate that file anywhere in the fpath!

No, you can't.  This causes all the lines to be numbered zero.

`zed -f' has the same problem; drives me nuts.
