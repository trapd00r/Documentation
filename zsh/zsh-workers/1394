NULL_GLOB.  It actually beats any related option.  Just as well too, as
this is relied upon in a number of places where NULL_GLOB is
temporarily set.

That patch isn't in the baseline yet.  It made the canonical form of
that option NOMATCH, so that "setopt NOMATCH", "unsetopt NOMATCH",
"setopt NO_NOMATCH" and "unsetopt NO_NOMATCH" are valid.  MATCH was not
made a legal option.  I actually added quite a bit of text explaining
this to the zshoptions man page in the patch.
