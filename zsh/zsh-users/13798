} i meant i created the functions  
} 
} user/create 
} user/private/checkAccount 
} user/private/DoSomethingWeird 
} user/delete 
} user/modify 
} 
} when i type user/<tab>, the completion must return
} 
} user/create 
} user/delete 
} user/modify 

OK, that's much easier.  What you want is

zstyle ':completion:*:-command-:*' ignored-patterns '*/private/*'
