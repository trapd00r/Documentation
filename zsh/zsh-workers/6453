Yes, indeed, I was thinking about that.  It doesn't stop you using a
different set of variables and unsetting MAILCHECK, of course, but that's a
little crufty.  On the other hand, we could introduce a special syntax,
e.g.  MAILCHECK could be (say) 60?checkname where checkname was the
function to run instead of the standard code.  How does that sound?  I
don't see any compatibility problems --- or is there something that could
fail because MAILCHECK is a scalar rather than an integer?

If I implemented this, I would try and produce a function to reproduce the
current checkmailpath to make it easier for people to hack it.  I suspect
this would use the stat module, otherwise it's going to be messy, but maybe
there are some tricks with globs.
