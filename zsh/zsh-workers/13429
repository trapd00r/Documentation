Hm, maybe. I don't remember why we used that instead of (q), I have
only a very faint memory of problems with (q) when that quoted more
than we wanted but unfortunately I don't remember what that was (and
not even in _expand, but in some other completion function, I think).

So for now I've just committed Peter's patch and left the old stuff
commented out.

Bye
 Sven
