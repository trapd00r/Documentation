Vi "r" seems to still have some problems.

Suppose you have a command line like:

   echo a=C3=A9o

and move the cursor to =C3=A9 and type "rb". Then the command line
will become

   echo =C3=A1b

In vireplacechars(), line 545 (zle_vi.c),
             foredel(n - newchars, CUT_RAW);

this will remove the base character "e" at zlecs, shift the
combining character, and move zlecs to the next base char "o".

     a e comb o
       |
       zlecs

will become

     a comb o
            |
            zlecs

and then "o" is replaced by "b".=
