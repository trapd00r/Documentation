hi,

the problem mentioned in this mail is not exactly fixed for me.

http://www.zsh.org/cgi-bin/mla/redirect?WORKERNUMBER=20469

since i also have LC_ALL set, the program still produces localized 
output, and therefore parsing fails, changing LANG=C to LC_ALL=C instead 
seems to solve the problem.

regards,
gustav munkby
