bor@itsrm2:~%> vared pat
pat    path

In other words, vared tried to complete the name of local variable, that is
defined in completion function :-) pat is not defined otherwise.

And it just occured to me, that the same could happen in e.g. [un]setopt. As
I understand, they do it by listing currently set/unset options ... with the
result, that if options are changed in some top level function, they will
list wrong options ...
