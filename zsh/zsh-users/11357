I may give that a shot some time.
It's easy enough these days to have a perfect fully functional cygwin 
install to do builds in, and I've built fairly recent zsh on SCO without 
even having to so much as twiddle the makefile, which is usually a pretty 
good test of source portability. ...hmm 4.2.5 sept 2005, not as recent as I 
thought...

Then again, as it turned out that |read functionality actually works even in 
my current version and I already wasn't missing any special features so I 
may never get around to it either.

Veering off topic, though still topical in so far as it's about zsh: One 
feature I do miss isn't there in the current version either. Only real ksh 
has, as far as I've been able to tell even today, built-in sleep that 
accepts less than one second values. Sleeping in a tight loop (semi tight, 
.1 sec, still a long time on todays cpu's as long as all I'm doing is 
checking the existence of a file) so that I can notice an event as soon as 
possible is the absolute last place I want to load an external binary and 
spawn a child process in every iteration. Perhaps the natural caching 
features in any modern OS magic away the issue and theres no longer a 
practical reason to worry about it, but it just wrankles. I'm currently 
using the sleep from some windows nt power tools package from M$ since it 
looked the lightest & smallest and supports small values and the package is 
a free (beer) download.
