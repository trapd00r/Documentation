Hi, zsh users.  Occasionally I run into the situation where I'd like to
glob all the files that are offered for completion.  The occasion that
just came up, for instance, was with "cvs add".  The zsh completion
function does a great job of suggesting which files would be new to the
cvs repository, but is there a way I can send all these suggestions to
"cvs add" in a glob-like operator?

(I don't know how many times I've assumed that the completion listings
were equivalent to the * glob operator.)

Thanks for any insight!
