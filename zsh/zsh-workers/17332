Looks good. I get a seg fault though when I try a failing search when
there are descriptions for the completion matches. Not always though.
I can reproduce it with ls -<tab><tab><ctrl-s>xy

It would also be nice if this could be invoked when scrolling a
completion list, i.e. from the listscroll keymap.
