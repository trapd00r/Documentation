Did this get through?  Anyone know what's wrong?
Please reply to me directly, as I don't read the list.
I tried b10, and the problem is still there.

Thanks.

Long live zsh!

To see where the zsh bug is, search below for the string "never execute"

The script that exhibits the alleged zsh bug is
a handy little script you might find useful if
you are connected to the internet only on demand.
You run this command when you want to force a connection.

VERSION=zsh 2.5.03

Thanks.
