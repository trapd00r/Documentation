A bit more info:  I just realized that the problem is caused when any entry
on the screen is longer than the width of the screen.  If I make the terminal
size very large, the problem does not happen, however as I resize the
terminal window to be narrower, it core dumps as soon as any entry is split
over 2 lines.
