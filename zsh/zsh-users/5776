    I'm with you that the default prompt is... ugly, more or less.
Anyway, I think that users that dare to give up bash and such a good
thing as zsh doesn't look for a pretty prompt, but for script power
and things like that. But, then again, you're true: won't do no harm
to provide 'pretty' defaults to show the power of ZSH. Any volunteer?
I can only contribute with my quite simple RC scripts O:)
