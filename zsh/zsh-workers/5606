From: Peter Stephenson <pws@ibmth.df.unipi.it>

Thought I'd introduce a little civilization to my bug reports:

Didn't we do this before?  Maybe I missed applying a patch (in which case
everyone else will have missed out by now, because it was a couple of weeks
ago):

% _foo() { local list='Hi mum!'; compgen -y '$list' -k '(foo bar)'; }
% compdef _foo foo
% foo ^D
<lists rubbish>

It's OK if $list is not local.
