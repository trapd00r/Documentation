Thanks very much to everyone who answered.

Just to clarify -- I know the simplest solution is just to avoid it, 
the next most simple solution is to use
zsh/ksh function syntax rather than posix syntax.

The main point of the question was that I don't see how/why it is a 
recursion, from the logic of the expressions, which is why I said there 
was some sort of fundamental gap in my understanding of how zsh works.
