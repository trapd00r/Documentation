Hi Folks:

1.  I realize this one deserves a RTFM answer, but I haven't been able 
to find it.

If I type

cp file1.txt file2.txt

and file2.txt doesn't already exist, zsh offers to "correct" the second 
argument by making it file1.txt.

Same with mv

This is really annoying. Is there a way to turn off the correction 
mechanism for the second argument but not the first?


2.  I built zsh 4.2.1 on OS X v. 10.3.5 and when I run make check, it 
hangs here:

./Y01completion.ztst: starting.

So far all the completions seem to be working in practice.  Should I 
worry about this?

Thanks.

Bill
