We could do this to _gdb

50c50
<     _alternative 'files:: _files' "processes:: _pids -m ${w[1]:t}"
---
>     _alternative "core-files:: _files -g '*core'" 'files:: _files' "processes:: _pids -m ${w[1]:t}"

and then you could set zstyle ':completion:*:complete:gdb:*' tag-order 'processes core-files'

What do people think?

The problem is accurately determining whether ps is SYSV- or BSD-style or
something else entirely.
