I confess that conforming to the docs is a good thing.  OTOH I don't see any
way to parameterize patterns for brace expansion if this is done.
(E.g. setting a parameter in a script to a pattern that will be used in brace
expansion in several places and which may need to be changed from time to
time.  IMO is a good thing to be able to do).  Am I overlooking something?  Is
there some other way to do this?
