Not really.  If you complete after

% echo '****

makecomplist() does a backdel() to replace the line to

% echo \*\*\*\*"
"

That will overwrite something before line in the memory.

But the line should not be restored since

% echo '*'<TAB>

should give

% echo \*

and not

% echo *

I do not line you alternative solution as well which executes
push-line-or-edit because it is probably not very convinient for those
using single_line_zle.  I think it is not a big limitation that completion
does not work in this rare case.  Note that

% echo foo\
> bar zle_t<TAB>

works and gives

% echo foo\
> bar zle_tricky.c
