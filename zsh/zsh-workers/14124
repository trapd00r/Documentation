Yeah, I've been meaning to mention this too.  Sven's recent change
only affected the keep-prefix code, but not the "suffix" setting.
Your example would also fail if you just had the $c3 variable (i.e.
any variable not at the start of the word).  I would like the default
setting of "suffix 1" to work like the "expand-or-complete" code's
expander in this regard.
