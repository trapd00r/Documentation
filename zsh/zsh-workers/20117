Hmmm... are you sure?  After the patch I get

% cat <<`echo `foo `bar
bquote> `
heredoc> 

which is what I expect.

At this point, there's no way of finishing the here-document because it
parses line by line and can't match the newline.  This is common to all
forms of quoting.  But that's not what was worrying you, by the looks of
it.
