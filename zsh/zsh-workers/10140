} This results in "brof" being inserted onto the command line.

Sven sent a patch to fix that, but there's still a problem with this:

	zle -U f
	zle -U r
	zle -U o
	zle -U b

Once again we get "brof".  Maybe we should just admit that there is no
input "queue" (only a stack), as is done with "print -z"?
