Hi Julien, Peter and other ZSH users, =0A=0AToday I uploaded a "package" th=
at provides a "Fish-like" user interface to ZSH. =0AOf course I used Julien=
's excellent syntax highlighting code from =0Ahttps://github.com/nicoulaj/z=
sh-syntax-highlighting for the syntax highlighting =0Astuff. The package al=
so contains a search widget, which I partially cooked up =0Amyself. It is b=
ased on an idea proposed by Peter in 2009 =0A(http://www.zsh.org/mla/users/=
2009/msg00818.html). For the rest I added some =0Ascripts that take care of=
 installing the files to the right location. =0A=0A=0AThe project is called=
 Fizsh, meaning Friendly Interactive ZSHell. It is a =0Afrontend to ZSH. It=
s purpose is to quickly provide users with an easy looking =0A(Fish-like) e=
nvironment, in which they can still execute Bourn-syntax snippets. =0AThis =
will hopefully entice users relatively new to ZSH, but it may also be of =
=0Ainterest to existing users, who like the Fish user interface and who wan=
t to use =0Ait while being able to use Bourn-syntax snippets at the same ti=
me. =0A=0A=0AI don't intend to fork Julien's syntax highlighting code. For =
future versions I =0Awill just check-out the latest version of his script. =
The search-widget will =0Ahave to be improved on the sourceforge site. Ther=
e are some obvious bugs in it, =0Aalthough I find it quite workable. Anyone=
 who has ideas, bug-reports, or =0Apatches, please feel free to mail them t=
o me, or to the FiZsh mailing list at =0Asourceforge. =0A=0A=0AFor those in=
terested: the project is available at =0Ahttp://sourceforge.net/projects/fi=
zsh/. You can find a tarball there, and a =0A".deb" archive. =0A=0A=0ABest =
wishes, =0A=0AGuido van Steen =0A=0A
