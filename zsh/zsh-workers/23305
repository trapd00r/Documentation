Thanks.  The crash is when outputting whitespace just before the "esac"
of a case statement.  I stepped through it and I couldn't see an obvious
problem.

It might be locale dependent; what are your settings?  Does exporting
a different value for LC_ALL make a difference?

Could you have a look at the values of the variables
tptr, tbuf, tlim, tsiz, tindent, tnewlins at the point of the crash?
(They're all file static in text.c, where it crashed.)
