Subject: completion bug in UTF-8 locale

Hi!

I have the following issue in UTF-8 locale:
zsh completion works ok in current folder, no matter which files are
here.
But suppose I have some directory named 'тест' (cyrillic letters).
Then
% ls те<Tab>
completes it to 'тест', but
% ls тест/<Tab>
doesn't show anything, even if there are no cyrillic-named items in that
directory.
