I didn't really follow your original question since you're code doesn't
seem to correspond to how the completion system actually works.

If you want to know how to use _arguments, start by looking at the many
existing completion functions that call _arguments and compare with what's
in the description for _arguments in the zshcompsys manual page.

For example, _hash (in Completion/Zsh/Command in the source) has the same
problem of dealing with an option -d that gets followed by a directory and
isn't as hairy of some of the files.  You will have to look around and if
you get stuck ask *specific* questions with which people will have more
time to help.

If you want a step-by-step guide, try the online guide at
http://zsh.sunsite.dk/Guide/zshguide06.html#l177
(that's the tutorial section for completion: you might want to start
earlier).

For more detailed guidance, our book
