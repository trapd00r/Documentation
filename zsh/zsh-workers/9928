::I realize most people on this list are now using 3.1.6-dev-19, but it'd
::be helpful to me if a few people could grab this and at least report any
::build-time errors.  Several of the changes are to the configure scripts,
::and I have only Linux to test on.
:Builds OK on NetBSD 1.4T (i386).  Haven't done much testing yet.

After some initial usage, got it into a state of:

fg: no such job: 3

Will see if I can reproduce.
