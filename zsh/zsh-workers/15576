Another way zsh doesn't quite emulate ksh, just FYI.

POSIX treats functions as macros so it does not redefine $0. 
The conform, $0 must remain the name of the shell or script, not
the function name.  I had to change ksh93 to conform since ksh88
hade $0 be the function name.

This is one of the reasons that ksh has stuck with the function name()
syntax.  These functions have scoping and behave more like shell
scripts than macros.  $0 is defined as the name of the function
for function name() functions.

Also, set -x causes each line of a function to be traced with the POSIX
shell.  Using function name() in ksh93 does not do this and you
can set the trace attribute individually for each function using
	typeset -ft name
