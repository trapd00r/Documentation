zsh-workers.

Note that it should use styles to be sufficiently general.  Something
similar to the jobview style would be appropriate:

# Completion of jobs can also be controlled by the `jobview' style.
# This uses the standard Perforce JobView syntax, and is applied
# in connection with the `max' style.  In other words,
# if you set
#   zstyle ':completion:*:p4-*:jobs' max 0
#   zstyle ':completion:*:p4-*:jobs' jobview 'user=pws'
# then jobs to be completed will be those from the output of
#   p4 jobs -e 'user=pws'
# i.e. those assigned to Perforce user `pws'.

except the form will be a bit different.  One possibility is to allow
e.g.

zstyle ':completion:*:p4-*:changes' changes -u pws

i.e. the argument would be added to `p4 changes'.  Then you could
specify a maximum that way (-m 20).  It would make the `max' style
obsolete.
