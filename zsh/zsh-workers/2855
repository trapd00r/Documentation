I have to say I'm very much against reducing the man pages.  It's more on
the theme of `what the average system administrator actually does', which
is install the man pages and no other documentation.  In my experience
(not theory, this is a real problem I've often had) if the information
disappears from the man pages it's simply not made available to the
user on a great many machines.
