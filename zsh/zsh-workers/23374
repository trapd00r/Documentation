Subject: java completion wrong?
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8; format=flowed
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Content-Disposition: inline

java hello <tab> completes commands instead of files, likewise for
java -jar hello.jar <tab>, the following patch seems to fix it, but I
don't know that much about java syntax so maybe it breaks something
else.
