Hrm.

I would have thought $'...' acted like any other string-substitution when
inside double-quotes, i.e. like $(...) $[...] and $((...)) all do.  I
suppose the reason it doesn't work is because "'" is a quoted single
quote, not an ordinary single quote ...?

I'm not certain this needs to be changed, but I wanted to be sure it's
intentional.
