But completion widget is a ZLE widget in the first place? And every
user-defined ZLE widget has some special parameters automatically setup -
and that includes BUFFER that does exactly what you need. See ZLE manuals.
(And we could HISTNO to these, 'course).

Do you call completion widgets in special way? Is it possible to unify
both - "normal" ZLE user-defined widgets and completion ones?
