Hi!

I really like zsh's feature to *edit* a variable with vared. Recently
I came across a situation where I needed to edit a function. After
STFM and TFW I still didn't know how to do that, so I edited the
function in my zshrc and reloaded the file whenever I made a change.

Now I'm curious if there already is such a builtin "funcedit" or so.
Is it even *possible* to edit a function in realtime?

Julius
