I also sent a patch for this yesterday, but it's stuck permanently in the
mail queue without telling anyone (and both the disks I have access to
filled up, so situtation completely normal).  It handled zle -la, but you
got a long format listing like zle -l which showed you aliases where
appropriate unless you also gave -r for raw, and there was also a -b for
builtin widgets only.
