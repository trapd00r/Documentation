Subject: subscript too small after complete in variable

Annoying completion issue (though with no ill effects beyond a delay and
message):
1. at prompt, enter "FOOBAR=" (no newline)
2. move cursor back a few characters (say, onto B)
3. activate complete-word (with tab)
4. shell hangs a second and then:
   _subscript:20: subscript too small: -262145

zsh 4.3.9.  Seems to be reproducible with various different options and
bindings, but let me know if you need more info.  Thanks.
