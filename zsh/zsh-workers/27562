Those have been there for a long time.  I don't have any evidence that
they're doing a lot of good but we have had people creating positional
parameters with <long_number>=something and wondering why it uses a lot of
memory.  I suppose this is similar.  The arbitrary limit is not very
useful and also undocumented; most people wouldn't miss it if it wasn't
there, certainly.
