That's why I mentioned rewriting the parameter code.  The same thing comes
up with ksh `discipline' functions, whose name I couldn't remember.  It
should be possible to intercept gets and sets in this way, even
recursively.  This is certainly not easy with the current code.  If it's
substantially easier to do it the other way for now that's fine.  But I
suspect we (for suitably arbitrary and not necessarily inclusive `we')
might end up rewriting it anyway.
