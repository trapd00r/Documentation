Hmph.  I still prefer my original suggestion: make aliases an internal
matter under zmodload control.  That way the user has full control, can see
straight away what's aliased to what, can change it, isn't forced to load
files by a bolshie computer, can add aliases for compatibility purposes
unforeseen by the developers/installer, and doesn't have 100k of no-op
lying on the disk.
