What does that `interactive' word in the style do? I can't find it in
the manual but if you remove it, the bug goes away. Any idea where you
got that from?

It also has a message at the top which looks like:
  interactive: /etc/[]

Yup, that's what I get.

At a basic level that would be:
  bindkey -M menuselect '^I' forward-char
but you shouldn't need to do that. That also seems to go across before
down.
