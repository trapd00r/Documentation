configure checks for libraries and will see where the termcap/curses stuff
can be found, but won't actually exit if it can't find it.

I would actually like to see this part of configure improved:  there are
various hard-wired search orders for libraries controlled partly by
--with-curses-terminfo and partly by system-specific tests.  However,
--with-curses-terminfo is now basically useless and it would be better to
turn it into a more general argument that gives a library search list.
