Subject: compinit/compdef useful outside of completion?

Don't you think, that these can be used not only with completion widgets? I
actually like the idea, when I just need to drop a file in defined place and it
will automatically be used next time I start shell. No more .zshrc editing etc.

What I mean, does it make sense to extend compinit/compdef to handle "normal"
user defined widgets as well ('course, the names will probably be too misleading
...). E.g. 'compdef -w widget function' to define normal widget. You could even
automatically bind it to key sequence with additional parameter ... say "-k
^Xn"?
And start function with '#compdef -w <widget>'

Comments?
