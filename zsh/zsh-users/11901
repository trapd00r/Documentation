Yes, _rsync is broken.

You are incorrect.  Try
cpv() {
rsync "$@"
}

You will not get rsync completion unless you do a "compdef _rsync cpv".
You could demand cp-like completion instead with "compdef _cp cpv",
though that would not be useful.  If you are witnessing different
results, perhaps you still have your alias set.
