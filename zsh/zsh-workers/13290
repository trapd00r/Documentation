The names are misleading: the vi- versions do something quite
different from the unprefixed versions, it's not just a question
of vi and Emacs doing something differently.  You'll notice that
vi-{up,down}-line-or-history are bound to "-" and "+" by default --
vi has both types of line movement.  (The difference is that the "-"/"+"
versions -- the "vi-"-prefixed widgets -- move the cursor to the beginning
of the target line, rather than leaving it at the same column.)

Your patch is wrong and should be reversed.  (I have bandwidth issues
right now so I can't reverse it myself.)  Without the patch, zle
accurately imitates vi in this respect.
