We have six name spaces for group names.

The whole thing comes from a time when we were thinking about ways to
get information about the matches already added. Then I was thinking
about using it for the stuff that is now done with _next_tags. I
didn't expect so much consistency and control in the shell code then.

So, I would like to make the question: should we remove it? I would
only comment it out in the C-code just in case we get a way to access
matches added some day (not for a long time, I think).

Actually, I was already tempted to remove it more than once and I
don't think it would cause much harm (or any at all) -- noone has
written another example completion system and the one we have doesn't
use this feature.

Comments? Opinions?

Bye
 Sven
