This is 3.0.5 on a Linux 2.0.31 system:

zagzig[25] echo >(cat)
/proc/self/fd/12

The problem with this is that /proc/self is relative to the current process,
i.e. zsh itself.  At least some non-builtin commands when passed that form of
file name as a parameter will be unable to open the file, and in any case
those special files are symlinks on Linux and do not qualify as named pipes.

zagzig[28] file <(sleep 10)
/proc/self/fd/11: broken symbolic link to [0000]:510538
zagzig[29] file >(sleep 10)
/proc/self/fd/12: broken symbolic link to [0000]:510543

It would seem from this that Linux should NOT use the PATH_DEV_FD code in
exec.c.  Am I missing something?
