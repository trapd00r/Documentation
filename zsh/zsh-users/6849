Yes, indeed.  Luckily, you can do:

(^CVS/)#*(.)

This is the more general form of ** --- the pattern in the parentheses
is used (here anything but the string CVS) instead of a `*' to match
directory names.  More precisely,
  **/
  (*/)#
are equivalent.  That's why you don't need another / after the parentheses.

You need extended_glob, but you must already have it set in this case.
