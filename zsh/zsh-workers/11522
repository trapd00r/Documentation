Subject: Segmentation fault 3.1.7-pre-3/4
Message-ID: <20000523094101.A25701@eggink4.rrz.uni-hamburg.de>
Mail-Followup-To: Zsh Workers <zsh-workers@sunsite.auc.dk>
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Disposition: inline
User-Agent: Mutt/1.1.14i

This gives a seg fault if executed in a script:

    read -q "REPLY?hm: "

Happens with pre-3 and pre-4, not with pre-1.

Regards,
Bernd
