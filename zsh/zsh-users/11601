Howdy Z Shellers,

I'm using the following function to prepare a directory of files from
those in a previous directory.  The files I want have Emacs backup
files with the same names except for ~ at the end.  So, I do NOT want
the backup files in the new directory.

This is a minimal example: the function as shown below just prints the
filenames, the rest of the code is fine; its the "for" line that needs
help.

function doit() {
   for file in $1/*(generic)*~*(~)
   print $file
   exit
}

Currently I get "doit:1: unknown file attribute."   When I enter this
globbing pattern at the interactive prompt, I get the files I want.

What's the proper way to match part of a filename and NOT the other
part?

Thanks,
Joel
