I had closer look at why Test/D07multibyte.ztst was being skipped on
HP-UX 11.11, I guess it was just too obvious to spot sooner.  The locale
on the system is en_US.utf8, but that name was being transformed before use.
Unfortunately NetBSD's problem isn't the same, so that's still to debug.

Either line modified in the following path is sufficient to get the test
running, take your pick if you want either or both.
