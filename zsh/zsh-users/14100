What happens in zsh is that assignments to an integer (or other numeric)
variable are subject to expansion, i.e. something like "var=five" is
equivalent to (( var = five )) if var has been suitably declared, so
that the value of $five is retrieved, probably numerically equivalent to
0.

This is normal zsh behaviour, but not very convenient for compatibility.
I don't think it would be hard to do it differently with a compatibility
option, but there's no simple workaround that I can see at the moment.
