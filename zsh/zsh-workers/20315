(Looks fine.  What are you using as a mail reader?)

Hmm.  OK, that's not so good, because it breaks "zle -I || ..." in the 
case where you want to know whether the display was NOT invalidated.
(Maybe there's never a reason to care about that, but ...)

I'm quite willing to have "zle -I" go back to testing for "invalidating
the display was a sensible thing to attempt" provided that "zle" (no args)
tests for "widgets callable", and that all of this is documented more
clearly.

Yeah.
