Subject: Running command in environment variable with space

Hi,

I'm trying to do something like:

	% blah='gvim -f'
	% $blah

but this fails with

	zsh: command not found: gvim -f

The same thing works fine in bash.

I'm not sure if this is a bug or a feature, but is there a way to run a 
command with options specified in one environment variable?

Thanks,

  - Michael
