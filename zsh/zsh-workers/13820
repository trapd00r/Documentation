} 
} Yes, that may be.  Even if it doesn't fix this particular problem, the 
} patch below should only make things saver.
} 
} Can someone try?

I still get the blank item in the list after your patch.  I think maybe
the problem is that tmp1 gets an empty element at line 94, which then
gets added as a match at line 120, but I tried duplicating your change
at line 94 without any better result.

Does `compadd -a array' where the array is empty have a bad effect?
