As far as I can tell:

6.1 Simple Commands & Pipelines
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

A _simple command_ is a sequence of optional parameter assignments
followed by blank-separated words, with optional redirections
interspersed.  The first word is the command to be executed, and the
remaining words, if any, are arguments to the command.  If a command
name is given, the parameter assignments modify the environment of the
command when it is executed.

May be, what is missing - explicit statement that if no command name is=20
given, parameter assignments modify current shell.
