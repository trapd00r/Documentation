} Just for the first interactive shell on the terminal. Background shell
} doesn't fall in that category. But why should a background shell attempt
} to initialize the terminal? It seems to me that background shell shouldn't
} call that function. On a related matter, does subshell initialize terminal?

Every zsh, foreground or background, calls init_io(), which in turn does all
the tty initialization if isatty(0).  There's no test for `interactive'.

This is, arguably, wrong.

Another init_io(), but this time only for interactive shells, happens if/when
"exec < /dev/foo" is run and foo is a tty device.
