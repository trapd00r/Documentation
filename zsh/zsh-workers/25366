Looks like the crucial change that makes zsh 4.3.5-dev and current SVN
sources fail is an extra source after the trap DEBUG:


#!/bin/zsh-beta -f
function debug_trap_handler {
   print $functrace[1]
  . ./bug-file
}

trap 'echo EXIT hit' EXIT
trap 'debug_trap_handler' DEBUG
. ./testing.sh

Put in ./testing.sh and bug-file some executable code. You probably
want to have several statements in testing.sh so you can see exiting
after the first statement.
