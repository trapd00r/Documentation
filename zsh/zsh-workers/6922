I've now looked at the new selection for menu completion. Firstly,
thanks Sven: it's great. There is one thing I don't like. When I move
the cursors to highlight the string I want to complete to and press
return, the highlighting is removed but menu-completion continues so if
I press tab again, it cycles through the selections as opposed to
accepting my selection and going on to complete whatever is next.
 
I also have problems with an aixterm where the next item on the left is
highlighted in addition to the one on the right in some circumstances.

That makes more sense now - thanks.

Thanks, bindkey -s "^[[100q" "^V^J" works very nicely.
