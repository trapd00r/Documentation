If this syntax is being developed, it seems weird that it's deprecated.  Does
anyone really want to get rid of it?   If so, fine.  But if the sentiment is
that these forms should be available without setting options, shouldn't they:
  a) be supported;
  b) not be advised against in the manual?

It seems a pity not to make the most of this useful feature.
