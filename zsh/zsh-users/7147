Thanks.

BTW, in my case, before using the above zstyle, when I did

  cd pri[TAB]

I got:

  princell  private/

where princell isn't a named directory, but a user name (~princell
being his home directory). If user home directories are regarded as
named directories (as ^xh suggests), then what does "users" mean?

I have the same problem as Stefan. I don't get the matches for the
next set of tags with it.

Concerning the keys, I also suggest "^[[Z", which corresponds to
shift-tab here.
