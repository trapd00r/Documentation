3.1.6-pws-something (at least the latest pws-6) has Functions/Misc/nslookup
which uses `vared' to read the user input, thus allowing command line
editing. Together with the new completion system this function will
also give you completion *inside* nslookup (and not only nslookup's
arguments).

To workers: seems like noone found this interesting enough to improve
the code I hacked up. Maybe sometime we could write a generic function 
for this task...

Bye
 Sven
