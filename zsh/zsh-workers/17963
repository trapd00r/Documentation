That's a feature. See the documentation for the squeeze-slashes style in
the manual:
         If  set  to `true', sequences of slashes (as in `foo//bar') will
         be treated as if they were only one slash when completing path-
         names.   This is the usual behaviour of UNIX paths.  However, by
         default the file completion function behaves as if there were  a
         `*' between the slashes.

So if you don't like it, set squeeze-slashes to true.

That could be a bug. Seems to occur after any ^D used to list choices.
