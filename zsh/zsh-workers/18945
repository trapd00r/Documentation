    because that's what it's supposed to do. read the sed description in
    SUSv3. (I'd quote the two paragraphs here but I fear breaking the
    ToS...) basically:

    * \n is not a valid replacement metacharacter
    * behavior of \X where X is not one of &, <digit>, <delimiter> or
      <newline> is undefined
    * if you want to embed a newline in the replacement, do it this way:

    sed 's/BRE/first part\
    second part/'

    Julian, looks like your sed is broken.
    I know I'm coming awfully late, but wanted to make this clear.
