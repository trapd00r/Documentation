The new completion shell code has been moved to a top-level subdirectory
Completion, which has a new README file --- this is not supposed to be the
final word on documentation.  Completion/ contains the subdirectories:

Core      essential files
Base      functions which are probably essential, but you way want to edit
          (including all the functions for -contexts-:  I added one for
          -redirect- to use _files, since it confused me when I found
          it wasn't.)
Builtins  completion for zsh builtins
User      sample completions for external commands
Commands  non-contextual completion functions, i.e. ones with separate
          bindings, currently _most_recent_file and _correct_filename.

For people not directly involved with the new completion saga:  this is
still probably not the final form, as we hope to make it installable, nor
are the internals fixed yet.

The other big change this time is approximate globbing; this is used by
Completion/Commands/_correct_filename .

Changes are as follows.  I haven't got round to a patch for QNX, or
anything for TRAPZERR inside completion functions.


Martin Buchholz: 5448: libc.h can't be included on Debian Linux, so only
include it on NeXT where it's necessary.

Matt: 5330: I've put this back the way it original was.  I hate sed almost
as much as awk.

Sven: 5455: keep track of which matcher specification to use

Sven: 5466: compwid manual for -after and -between

Sven: 5467: expn manual typo

Sven: 5469: init fix and Functions/Completion/_comp_parts

Sven: 5470: new completion conditions didn't handle untokenization
consistently.

Sven: 5471: range code knows not to handle associative arrays

Sven: 5476: quoting of tildes in Functions/Completion/_path_files

Sven: 5483: completeinword fixes

Sven: 5489: control for matching in _path_files and _comp_parts

Sven: 5490: unset test for AA elements when substituting

pws: unposted, see 5503: remove dynamic=no from configure.in when
underscore is needed.

pws: 5508: init and dump, globbing and printing.

Sven: 5511: make sure compctl is available for new completion

Sven: 5512, 5525: globcomplete fix for new completion

Sven: 5521: improved option handling for _path_files

Sven: 5529: cleanup for Functions/Completion

pws: 5531: small init fix

pws: 5538: approximate pattern matching, (#a1)readme etc.

Sven: 5543: compadd -X, zshcompwid manual

Sven: 5544: another completion cleanup

pws: 5545: silly set -x mistake

Sven: 5548: _path_files, _comp_parts

Matt: 5553: under _WIN32, .exe suffix is optional for commands

pws: unposted: Functions/Completion moved to Completion; subdirectories
Core, Base, Builtins, User, Commands created; Completion/README created.
