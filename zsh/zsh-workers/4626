zagzig<1> typeset -A foo
zagzig<2> foo[bar]=fred
zagzig<3> foo[7]="the winter of our discontent"
zagzig<4> foo[$foo[7]]=shakespeare
zsh: bad math expression: unbalanced stack
zagzig<5> print -l "$foo[@]"
shakespeare
the winter of our discontent
fred
zagzig<6> print -l "${(k)foo[@]}"
the winter of our discontent
7
bar

The only way I could get zsh to accept spaces in the [ ] was to use a
variable reference, and then I get the "unbalanced stack" error on the
first reference, even though it does work thereafter.

Gotta go now, perhaps more on this over the weekend.
