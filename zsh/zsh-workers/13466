Subject: zsh 3.0.8 redirection bug
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-15
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

This appears to be a bug according to my (and Bash's) understanding
of redirection.  It isn't a known bug mentioned in the FAQ (2001/01/24).

Here is a short session log which shows the problem.

# /tmp% cat foo
# echo stdout
# echo stderr >&2
# /#tmp% ./foo
# stdout
# stderr
# /tmp% ./foo | nl
# stderr
#      1  stdout
# /tmp% ./foo 2>&1 | nl
#      1  stdout
#      2  stderr
# /tmp% ./foo 2>&1 >foo.out
# stderr
# /tmp% ./foo 2>&1 >foo.out | nl
#      1  stderr
#      2  stdout
# /tmp% cat foo.out
# stdout
# /tmp% exec /bin/bash
# [toby@means /tmp]$ ./foo 2>&1 >foo.out | nl
#      1  stderr
# [toby@means /tmp]$ exit

For some reason piping the output causes the original
standard output, which had been safely sent to a file,
to be re-animated.
