I haven't been into this in enough detail to propose a definite fix, but
how about something like: set a flag when calling zleread() from the shell
input mechanism (which is where we may need another line) to postpone the
trashzle() --- we can make the last argument take or'd flags.  Then call
trashzle() instead when input processing is really finished: maybe in
hend() would do the trick.  I can believe it's not that simple.

I think you're right that the correct thing to do is something much more
sophisticated anyway.  But I'm not sure what and I'm not convinced it's
ever going to happen.
