That's because of your ZLS_COLOURS='...:*=36;40', of course, such
`empty' patterns were silently ignored before the patch.

When I first posted collist I asked if someone who uses GNU-ls with
colours could check if collist does the same as that; this is one of
the places where I wasn't sure. Since I don't have a GNU-ls here, I
have to ask: in complist patterns take precedence over file-type-
capabilities -- is this different in the GNU-ls?

Bye
 Sven
