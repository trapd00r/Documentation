Whot? I though zsh even cooks you coffee in the morning if
you just tell it to. How about (untested, but let's give
it a go):

function scrub-history-incremental-search-backward () {
   bindkey -r "."
   zle .history-incremental-search-backward
   bindkey "." rationalise-dot
}

zle -N scrub-history-incremental-search-backward

bindkey "^R" scrub-history-incremental-search-backward
