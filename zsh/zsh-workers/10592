Have you ever broken a bone in your body? Well chances are that you have. Do you 
remember the inconvenience that it caused you? First you went to the Doctor. Then 
they set the bone. Then you had to not use that area of your body for weeks to let 
it heal. The worst was if you broke a bone somewhere on your leg. If you were 
lucky you got to use crutches. You still can remember the pains in your hands and 
your armpits. If you were unfortunate, you used a wheelchair. You learned how 
gravity could be your enemy when going up a hill. It made you realize how hard 
life was to be physically impaired and you gained a new appreciation for their 
hardships. 

Well now there is a company trying to make it easier for people in that situation. 
Piccard Medical Corporation is introducing a revolutionary of Wheeled chairs and 
accessories that go beyond all reasonable expectations. They are designed with
