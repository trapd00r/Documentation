zsh 4.3.9

I found something along the following lines:

zstyle -e ':completion:*' file-patterns '[[ $PREFIX =3D=3D =
/expanded/path/to/network/[^/]# ]] && { setopt noglob; reply=3D(*(@)); =
setopt glob }'

That doesn't appear to do anything interesting though. I suspect I'm =
barking up the wrong tree with that one?
