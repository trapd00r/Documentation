% man 1 zshoptions

SPECIFYING OPTIONS
       Options are primarily referred to by name.  These names are case insen-
       sitive and underscores are ignored.  For example, `allexport' is equiv-
       alent to `A__lleXP_ort'.

If I understand your question correctly, this is what you want:

[snip]
zsh% dirs -v
0       ~
zsh% setopt autocd
zsh% setopt autopushd     
zsh% /bin
zsh% /usr/local 
zsh% /home/ftp
zsh% ~
zsh% dirs -v         
0       ~
1       /home/ftp
2       /usr/local
3       /bin
[snap]

A autocd that does pushd.

Regards, Frank
