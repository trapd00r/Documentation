The version of zsh I have installed on my Solaris machines keeps
the context for multiline commands to help me remember where I am:

	for i in * ; do
	for> if [ "$i" = "0" ] ; then
	for then>

However, on my SuSE 9.3 machines this seems to be disabled 

	for i in * ; do
	> if [ "$i" = "0" ] ; then
	>

anyone know what the directive is to enable this behavior?
