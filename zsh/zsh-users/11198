          local -a cmdarray

Defining $cmdarray as a local array fixes this problem. $cmdarray
would otherwise be created as a global parameter. I'm setting the
'warncreateglobal' option to be alerted, when I'm doing that myself.
I actually fail to see, _why_ this fixes the problem, yet it does. :-)

                  case ${$(whence -w print)[2]} in

Away with that cut! :)

                  cmdarray=(${(f)"$(whence -pa $1)"})

Um, this is just the I'm used to write this, which I thought was
accurate. Can someone comment on what the difference between
${(f)"$( foobar )"} and "${(f)$( foobar ) }" is, if there's any?
