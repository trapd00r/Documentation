I've just traced a couple of problems I was having with zsh to the fact
that it was running everything in the /etc/z* files. In the past, these
were always ignored unless you used one of the configure options such as
--enable-etcdir yet they seem to always be being read now.

This probably isn't system specific because it is occurring both on IRIX
and Linux. 3.1.9-dev-8 was okay so it is since then.
