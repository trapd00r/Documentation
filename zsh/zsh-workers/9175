Well I am not sure if this is a bug or not, but I was able to reproduce
it on a few machines that all were in Y2K.

It has to do with the RPROMPT variable and strftime, I believe.

I have my RPROMPT set like this:

PROMPT='%n@%m: %~%(#.#.>) '
RPROMPT='[%D{%b %d, %G} / %t]'

And on the prompt, it displays this:

mike@mindcrime: ~>                            [Jan 01, 1999 / 3:04AM]

But date says this:

Sat Jan  1 03:04:42 PST 2000

- Mike
