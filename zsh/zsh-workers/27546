This still happens to me both with -f and without, it happens on 4.3.4
too (didn't try any other versions). If it wasn't clear, the
ctrl-shift-200b part is terminal specific, if you don't use urxvt you
would need to input it some other way (for example echo
$'\u200b'|xclip and then just middle click after pressing ctrl-r).
