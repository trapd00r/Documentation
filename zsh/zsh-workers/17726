Looks like a bare minimum implementation could be done with mbtowc() and
wcwidth(), to get zle output fixed up.  mbtowc() returns a length (as
does mblen()) so if we rely on these two working as per standard we
should be OK.  In that case we can avoid counting character lengths
ourself, which is more portable.
