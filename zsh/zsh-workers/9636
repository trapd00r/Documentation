} config.status has:
} 
}   s%@RLIMITS_INC_H@%/usr/include/asm/resource.h%g

@RLIMITS_INC_H@ is used only in Modules/Makefile.in, whence it comes
via rlimits.mdd.

It appears that zsh expects to get RLIM_NLIMITS (possibly indirectly)
from <sys/resource.h>, which is included by Src/system.h.  However, that
depends on HAVE_SYS_RESOURCE_H being defined.

The actual mention of RLIM_NLIMITS in exec.epro began when Zefram put
in the "mod_export" keyword back in December and revised the way that
makepro.awk works.  However, I don't see how exec.c itself compiled
before if you're having problems with the .epro now; the trouble appears
to be that HAVE_GETRLIMIT assumes HAVE_SYS_RESOURCE_H, but that must
date from long ago (before I was keeping a CVS repository, at least).

The only other even remotely recent change is that configure.in now
looks at /usr/include/bits/resource.h in addition to all the other
places it used to look, but that's still from last November.

So I'm puzzled, but:  Zefram et al., what's the reason that those
HAVE_GETRLIMIT bits in exec.c were never moved to the rlimits module?
