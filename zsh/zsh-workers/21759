Yes, you're right, now that I think of it.  But they should still be mentioned under redirections with a pointer to where to find them discussed.  (The use of "<" is a little confusing, too.)  Any shell user knows about redirection, but then when you imagine this new facility you want (as I did), you don't have a name for it, so redirection is the first place you look.
