Well, as i wrote further down my completer list is _oldlist _complete
_correct, i don't know if that is a yes or a no :).

Okay, so I was testing if ls --*e(#e)<tab> worked with globcomplete
on, which it does (ie it only lists options ending in 'e'). But since
I forgot which flag meant end of string, i pressed tab at the #, but
got
_path_files:25: command not found: _globflags
printed 5 or 6 times, if I run autoload _globflags it works. This
seems odd to me since _globquals seems to work without any special
treatment.

Okay, there is probably a whole level of stuff going on here that I
wasn't even aware of.
