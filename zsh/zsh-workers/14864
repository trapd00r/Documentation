...and we don't want to set it for that because it's apparently correct for
the POSIX shell.  Should we introduce a separate emulation for bash?  It's
getting horribly complicated and we've never been that concerned about bash
compatilibity for non-POSIX features.

By the way, bash also seems to have the equivalent of MAGIC_EQUAL_SUBST
set:

  bash$ args() { typeset f; for f in "$@"; do echo $f; done; }
  bash$ args `echo one two`
  one
  two
  bash$ args foo`echo one two`
  fooone
  two
  bash$ args foo=`echo one two`
  foo=one two
