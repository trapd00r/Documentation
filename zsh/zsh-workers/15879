Subject: tcp module uses `poll' unconditionally.
Date: Thu, 27 Sep 2001 11:44:27 +0100
Message-ID: <3851.1001587467@csr.com>
From: Peter Stephenson <pws@csr.com>

tcp.c uses poll() at line 546.  It should test HAVE_POLL and if that fails
use select().  This screws up (my version of) cygwin.

zftp has a fallback to do something more limited if neither poll() nor
select() is available, tcp should probably do the same.
