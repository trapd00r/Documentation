Subject: command completion taking ages
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

If I press tab in a position where all commands are completed, I get a
very long delay. This is quite annoying even though I can interrupt it
with Ctrl-C. Is there a way using the zstyle, tags and _wanted stuff
that I could indicate with zstyle that I don't want to complete commands
if $#PREFIX = 0. I couldn't see any styles which are passed through eval
in any of _requested, _wanted, _tags etc but other than using the
high-level stuff for tag ordering, I don't fully understand the tag
selection stuff so I may well have missed something.

Oliver
