Hi!

I noticed that the zsh does not exit when I press ^D.
IGNORE_EOF has *not* been set and I type in ^D right at the beginning.
However, the zsh tried to expand some non-existent command and asks me
"zsh: do you wish to see all 2667 possibilities?".

It does not happen always, eg right after starting the zsh it does work.
I could not find a situation where it will always happen.

This has bugged me for a long time and I assume that this must be known.
If this is mentioned in some FAQ then please point me at it.  Thank you!

Sven
