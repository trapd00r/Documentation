No, that's a completely different bug.

This does not work even if glob_subst is set.

You did not use backslashes here.  The problem is that remnulargs() should
probably be called before globlist() in the relevant part of zle_tricty.c,
but I have to think about it a little to figure out the right solution.  An
alternative solution is to ignore INULL characters in glob.c.
