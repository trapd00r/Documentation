Great. Works for me, too.  Will use that.  I'll send a patch when the changes
make it into the repository.  I don't think there is a need for try 3.

Drat, I don't have any tests that use the double star syntax...

I used several recent versions of zsh to create the output for the tests, plus
a little hand-editing.  Sven's changes have fixed some problems, that I might
have left in, because I'm unclear on what the proper result should be.  Like
the problem report from workers/11388.

Hopefully the test will help.  I think matching control is great.
