That url at the bottom of the PR webpage was not added by the
responder.  Gnats automatically adds it to the end of every email.  The
%z commit was made to -CURRENT (4.0 at that time) 5 months before you
submitted your PR.  I'm not sure why it wasn't merged back into -STABLE
(3.4 at that time).

  RCS file: /home/ncvs/src/lib/libc/stdtime/strftime.c,v
  revision 1.25
  date: 2000/01/28 17:40:42;  author: joerg;  state: Exp;  lines: +17 -1
  branches:  1.25.2;

  There were so far only 42 different conversion specifications in
  strftime(3), add another one. :) %z yields the local timezone's
  offset in hours and minutes, as used in RFC822 headers.  There's a
  precedence for this in Lunux' libc, and Internet software (like Perl
  scripts) start using it.

  OKed by (wrt. the code freeze): jkh
