Subject: The FAQ, "function", and aliases
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

The FAQ sayeth:

	Luckily, it is not possible to define function as an alias.

But at some point it did become possible to do so:

schaefer[529] alias function=foo
schaefer[530] function bar
zsh: command not found: foo

This is unfortunate.
