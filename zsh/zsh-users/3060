I like lots of history as in  ... what was that command I typed two years ago
mmm... ^-R and its back ;)

Problem is that I cannot seem to grow my history file - as you can see by
the grep -i from my zshrc I am quite ambitous.  I often toggle setting
and go wc -l $HISTFILE but get no more that 500 or up to 1000 if lucky -
what could be keeping the file small?

grep -i /etc/zshrc:


set INC_APPEND_HISTORY 
set SHARE_HISTORY 
export HISTFILE=~/.zsh_history
export HISTSIZE=10000
export HISTFILESIZE=10000
export SAVEHIST=10000
setopt
      append_history \
		bang_hist \
		hist_allow_clobber \
		hist_expire_dups_first \
		hist_ignore_all_dups \
      histignoredups \
		inc_append_history \
      hist_ignore_dups \
      extendedhistory 
       #histverify
       #setopt hist_ignore_dups \
       #extendedhistory \
       #histignoredups \
       #histverify
