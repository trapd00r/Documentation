The operational answer is "because all previous versions of zsh do that,
and it hasn't been fixed yet in 3.0.8."

The semantic answer is "because the value of a variable evaluated in math
context is treated as an expression, and that expression is itself
evaluated."

E.g.

b=7
a=b
(( a )) --> b --> 7

a="3 + 4"
(( a )) --> 3 + 4 --> 7

a=a
(( a )) --> a --> a --> a --> ...

Hence in 3.1.somethingmorethan6butIforgetwhat, an arbitrary limit on the
depth of math recursion was imposed, and you get:

> zsh: math recursion limit exceeded

This does mean that there are expressions you can evaluate in 3.0.8 that
will eventually resolve to a value, which you can't evaluate in 3.1.9.  
They're a lot more complicated than anything you'd be likely to write out
by hand, though.
