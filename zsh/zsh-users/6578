Subject: spelling correction bug?

I have my zsh-4.0.4 configured for spelling correction:

  setopt CORRECT
  unsetopt CORRECT_ALL

(not using the new completion system yet).  Now, when I type

  $ mape all

zsh asks

  zsh: correct 'mape' to 'mpage' [nyae]? 

But "mpage" is two character errors away from "mape", while "make"
is only one error away.  Shouldn't it try closer matches first?

Ciao
