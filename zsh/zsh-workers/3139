That's bad.  I've been using using patch -p for ages.

Yes, you should not use it without -p.  It can patch the wrong Makefile.in
and other bad things can happen.

Yes, -p0 was always legal, but I was always lazy to write this redundant
zero.  And I'm sure that I'll keep forgetting this well after I upgrade my
patch program.

Which is OK, since no other POSIX/Bourne shell can parse that line.  I did
not notice this since when I tested this, the patch did not fail and this
line was never executed.
