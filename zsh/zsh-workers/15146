One complication of this is:

schaefer<509> cd soft/<TAB>
Completing directories after cdablevar
software/       src/            sparc-solaris/  share/          scripts/      
Completing local directories
subdir/

The "local directory" listed above is really ./software/subdir/.  Cycling
through the menu completions inserts it properly -- it's just the display
that is wrong.
