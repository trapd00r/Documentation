Interesting.

I ran these two tests tests with sh, ksh, bash, and zsh.

while(true)do(pwd)done
    This worked in sh, ksh, and bash.  It failed only in zsh.

sh -c 'exec </nonexistent/a; echo wrong'
    This did not print "wrong" in sh and ksh.

    Zsh prints wrong in both sh and zsh mode and bash only prints "wrong"
    without the --posix switch.
