How does one close the input to the coproc, so as to send it an end-of-file?
The only thing I've come up with is "coproc exit" which seems rather silly
and which closes both the input and the output.

And shouldn't there be an entry for "coproc" in the documentation under one
or the other of "Shell Builtin Commands" or "Precommand Modifiers"?  Having
it buried only in the middle of a paragraph in "Simple Commands" is not very
helpful.
