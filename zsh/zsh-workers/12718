There's a bit about it in the Etc/zsh-development-guide. But in some
cases... (I think Peter and I were changing things back and forth in
the completion system documentation some time ago). For example, the
documentation of the ignore-parents style. Sometimes tt(../),
sometimes `tt(../)'. It may even be consistent, but doesn't look good, 
I think.

So, if you want to change the standard... ;-)

Bye
 Sven
