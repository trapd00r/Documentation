This is a really ugly bug. It comes from the fact that the options are 
added with a `r:|-=*' match spec and commands are not. The completion
code currently can't merge the unambiguous string information if the
equal substrings are in an anchor for some matches and in a normal
string-part for other matches.

And the more I think about ways to solve this the more complicated it
gets. So I'll need some more time.

Here the completion code starts completing the matches for command
position. And they include the `!' (the `not' operaator/precommand
specifier).

I don't get this doubled `!'. For me it just continues inserting
command names and such things.
