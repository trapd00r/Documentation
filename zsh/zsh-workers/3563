Maybe I can chime in here.

It would be child's play for me to set this up somewhere under the ZSH web  
page @ PEAK.org (http://www.peak.org/zsh/).  I already have an email-2-html  
setup there.

The easiest way would be if we could agree to send patches to 'zsh@peak.org'  
(another address for me).  That way no one has to remember any special  
Subjects and it would be easy enough to do (just CC that address when you  
send in a patch).
	Upside: no non-Patches would show up, trivial to maintain
	Downside: if you don't remember to send it there, it doesn't get
		added

If it was deemed better to use a certain Subject: header such as PATCH that  
would be fine too
	Upside: only have to remember one address
	Downside: have to remember the right Subject header
