Ok - that seems like a reasonable thing to do.

Just because it is a reliable way to test for terminal-ness. So if I
can open a tty, see if that works, and if so get the associated file
descriptor for that then it would be a way to see if the device name
is a terminal.

But of course this is a bit involved and I'd only contemplate that if
there were nothing better.
