Changing the host may confuse software that expects it not to change,
may break user configuration (for instance, I use the same config
files on various machines, and test the FQDN when a difference is
needed), and so on.

There's a host name associated with the IP address, but this doesn't
mean that it should be the same as $HOST. Otherwise what would you do
if you wanted to connect to 2 networks (wireless or not) at the same
time?
