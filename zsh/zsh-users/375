I compiled zsh-3.0.0 just yesterday.  For this reason and as it's my first
contact with zsh at all, I won't guarantee that everything is ok, but
technically the compilation went well (i.e. no error messages), and zsh
seems to behave as it should.

The machine is a 9000/712 running under HP-UX 10.10, and the compiler I
used was gcc-2.7.2.
