Subject: jobs-output


Hm...

  beta% (sleep 10; print '
  subsh quote> foo
  subsh quote> ') &
  [1] 25026
  beta% jobs
  [1]  + running    ( sleep 10; print '
  foo
  ' )
  beta%

We normally take care to make the text produced for the `jobs' output
fit on one line, but if there is a string with newlines they are kept.

A bit ugly, isn't it?

Bye
 Sven
