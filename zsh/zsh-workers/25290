Hi,

Please reply with your suggestions for contribution.

Here are my views,

1. Contributing back to the current development brach of the Zsh project.
    - This is just by getting our changes under a compiler switch specific
to Symbian, may be __SYMBIAN32__, then making sure the code compiles and
works as expected for both the platforms. Symbian code structure is
different from the Zsh project, hence we need to change this to align with
Zsh project.
    -  Any update to the Symbian specific source can only be performed by
using the available Symbian SDK for Windows as we currently don't have one
for Linux and there is no solution yet to emulate Symbian OS on Linux.

2. Contribution categorised by platform, having a separate code base for
Symbian.
   - This is just by pushing our code with the current code structure, the
integration to this branch would be an extra effort.

3. Zsh project advertising the source hosted in Symbian Developer Network.
    - This doesn't need any contribution to the Zsh project, the integration
activities will have to be maintained by Symbian.

Please post your views about any other sort of possibilities.

Thanks,
Karthik.

<br>
Thanks for the note... we&#39;d certainly be interested in integrating your<br>

version<br>
(4.3) since there isn&#39;t any active development of older branches.<br>

As you no doubt know, most of the discussion about details goes on on the<br>
zsh-workers mailing list. &nbsp;We&#39;d be happy to look at patches to allow<br>

is<br>
probably the easy bit; setting up the configuration in the first place

makes things difficult, since zsh has to probe various bits of run-time<br>

ways of providing the necessary information. &nbsp;Alternatively, I suppose
we<br>
might be able to supply a library of pre-built configuration headers for<br>

Hi Peter,<br>
  <br>
To introduce myself, Iam a software engineer&nbsp; working&nbsp; for a company called Symbian (<a href="http://www.symbian.com" target="_blank">www.symbian.com</a>) in Bangalore, India. <br>
  <br>
I have been subscribed to zsh-workers since long time and have seen
lots of your postings related to submissions/defect fixes/technical
discussions, so thought you would be my better point of contact for my
interest.<br>
  <br>
Actually, i was involved in a project of Symbian where we had migrated
Zsh onto Symbian OS sourced from the opensource Zsh project
(<a href="http://linux.softpedia.com/get/Programming/Interpreters/Zsh-1183.shtml" target="_blank">http://linux.softpedia.com/get/Programming/Interpreters/Zsh-1183.shtml</a>),&nbsp;
now we are interested to look at the possibilities of contributing back
our changes to the Zsh project, for which i would like to know the
process involved from the Zsh project perspective and moving forward we
can discuss about the changes and the list of features that we were not
able to support due to certain limitations.<br>
  <br>
Iam sorry if you are not the right person for this query, please do
redirect me to the person who would be of better help in that case.<br>
  <br>
PS: This is just an initial mail to inform about our work, we can further discuss in detail. <br>
  <br>
