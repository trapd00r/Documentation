Geoff, are you out there?

Would it be possible for the search interface (wilma_glimpse) on the zsh
mailing list archives to default to display results in most-recent-first
order, rather than least-recent-first?  Its becoming increasingly useless
to search the archives without restricting the search to the current year,
because the limit on number of matches is usually reached before making
it out of the 1990's.
