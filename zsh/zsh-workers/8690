Sorry for being a bit slow to reply to these - I've been quite busy at
work recently.

That worked - brilliant. I've attached the patch to make that change.

I didn't use -p0 - I was using -p1. I didn't think properly when I read
the man page. I've had problems with patches before and that must have
been the problem. Thanks.

I applied your patch and got unresolved symbols when building
complist.so. These symbols turned out to be all listed in zle.export. I
altered the Src/Zle/Makefile so that the EXPIMP_complist = line included
a reference to import zle.export. Zsh then compiled without any further
problems. Obviously the Makefile is auto-generated so a patch to it
isn't the proper fix. I don't understand the whole make setup so I'm not
sure what is - adding zle to complist.mdd's moddeps might be?
