                     7 Solving Problems and Getting Service

Operating Problems

   Table 7-1 lists some possible operating problems and suggested
   solutions. If you have a problem with your terminal, check this list
   before calling for service. If you need service, see "Digital Service"
   in this chapter.

   CAPTION: Table 7-1 Operating Problems

   Problem Suggested Solution
   The terminal does not turn on when you set the power switch to 1. Make
   sure the power cord is plugged in. Check the power outlet by plugging
   in a lamp to see if it lights.
   After the "VT320 OK" message appears on the screen, there is no
   response from the host when you try to log in.

   Make sure your system cable at the rear of the terminal is connected
   securely.

   Make sure the port that your system cable is connected to is active.
   Check the Host Port Selection feature in the Communications Set-Up
   screen (Chapter 4).
   The printer does not print.

   Make sure the printer is plugged in, and its power switch is on.

   Make sure the cable connection between the printer and terminal is
   tight.

   Make sure the communication settings on the terminal and printer match,
   such as baud rate and parity. See the Printer Set-Up screen (Chapter
   4).
   Text on the screen does not scroll. The Hold Screen indicator is on.
   Press the Hold Screen key to resume scrolling.
   The keyboard seems to be locked (the Wait indicator may be on), and the
   VT320 cannot display new text from the host. Clear the terminal by
   using the Clear Comm feature in the Set-Up Directory (Chapter 4).
   The screen is blank, but the terminal is on. The power is okay.

   The CRT saver feature may be on (Chapter 2). Check the lower right of
   the screen for the blinking CRT saver cursor. If the CRT saver feature
   is on, press any key to reactive the screen.

   Make sure the brightness and contrast controls are correctly adjusted.
   The bell tone does not sound when you turn the VT320 on. All keyboard
   indicator lights are off. Make sure the keyboard is connected to the
   terminal.

Power-Up Self-Test

   Every time you turn the terminal on, the VT320 automatically runs a
   power-up self-test. This test checks the operating status of many
   internal parts in the terminal. During the test, the keyboard
   indicators turn on and off, and the bell tone sounds. If the test is
   successful, a "VT320 OK" message appears on the screen.

  Error Messages

   If the VT320 fails the power-up self-test, the terminal may display one
   of the error messages in Table 7-2. Only qualified service personnel
   should try to correct these problems. You should note any error message
   that appears and call for service.

   The keyboard indicator lights may flash in different patterns during
   the test. These patterns are codes that provide service personnel with
   further information about the terminal's operating condition.
