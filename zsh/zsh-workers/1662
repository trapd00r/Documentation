Here's zsh 3.0-pre2:

zagzig[85] echo z*i<TAB>
(feep)
zagzig[85] echo z*i

Here's zsh 3.0-pre3:

zagzig<3> echo z*i<TAB>
(feep)
zagzig<3> echo z\*i

I really prefer the pre2 behavior.  I suspect this has something to do
with Zoltan's simplification of the code in docomplete(), but I'm not
sure what.  Probably replacement of the loop that walks chline with a
single call to inststr(chline)?
