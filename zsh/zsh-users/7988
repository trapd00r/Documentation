In some cases (Cygwin) it indeed does have spaces.
However, your solution seems not to be optiomal:

~> export PATH=/bin:/usr/bin:/bin//:/bin/
~> which ls                              
/bin/ls
~> path=(${(qq)${path//\/##/\/}%/})
~> echo $PATH
'/bin':'/usr/bin':'/bin/'
~> which ls
ls not found
zsh: exit 1

I did the following, works perfectly for me:

Last line of ~/.zlogin is:

[[ "$OSTYPE" = *cygwin* && $ARGC -eq 1 ]] && cd "$@"

And this registry settings was added to Windows
registry:

Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Folder\shell\command]
@="Cygwin Here"

[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Folder\shell\command\command]
@="\"C:\\cygwin\\bin\\zsh.exe\" -l -s \"%1\""

Thanks!
