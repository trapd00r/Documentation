You should get exactly that. In the test the cursor was placed after
the `build'.

Damn. I'm still pretty sure this has to do with some uninitialised
memory. But where?

But this should probably not keep us from releasing 3.1.7. If we don't 
want users to see this we could comment the test out. I'll keep it on
my list, although I fear I will never be able to reproduce it.

Bye
