Yes, but there's no removing of redundancies.  There's back-mapping too, if you set CDPATH then cdpath gets set.

Yes, standard array syntax.

Try:

cdpath=(.. ..)
echo $cdpath	;# Should give ".. .."
typeset -U cdpath
echo $cdpath	;# Should give ".."

Works in my 3.1.2 beta, anyway.  I don't know whether typeset -U is in 3.0.5.
