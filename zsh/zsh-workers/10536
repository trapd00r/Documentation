} 1) We have this extra hack in configure to change config.status to

}    me, because it searches for a line where `ac_file_inputs' is
}    assigned to -- and my config.status doesn't contain such a line.
}    It always uses `$ac_given_srcdir/$ac_file_in'.

What version of autoconf do you have installed?  I think you need at least
2.12, maybe 2.13, for this to work.  Peter has 2.14, IIRC, but I have 2.13
and I have the ac_file_inputs line in my config.status.

} 2) make distclean fails for me because it calls distclean twice in the 
}    Test directory -- and then the second one has no Makefile and I end 
}    up with the main directory un-cleaned.
}    This can be fixed by removing:
} 
} 	@cd Test && $(MAKE) $(MAKEDEFS) $@

You're right, that should have been removed when Test was added to SUBDIRS.
