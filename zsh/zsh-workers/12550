Subject: Rpm completion problem

I've noticed a problem in rpm completions when I specify the 'p'
(package file) option bunched up with other options.  For instance:

    rpm -qip file<tab>

completes the names of installed packages (though it does complete
file names if there is no installed-package match), while:

    rpm -qi -p file<tab>

properly completes only the files in the current directory.
