} I just downloaded, compiled, and installed zsh-4.06 but keep getting 
} permission denied errors when attempting to use completion. 

The first question is, are you completing with the newer compsys completion
(installed with `compinit' from your startup files) or the older compctl
completion (which is still the default)?

If the former, have you tried using ctrl-x question-mark, the binding for
_complete_debug, to see where the error is occurring?

Does it matter WHAT you're completing?  Files?  Directories?  Option names
for `setopt'?  Variable names?

The more information you provide, the more likely it is somebody will be
able to recognize the problem.
