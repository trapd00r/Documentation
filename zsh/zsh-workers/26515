Hello,

Looking through the manuals for the special treatment for prompt
variables, there are multiple references to section "Prompt Expansion"
(e.g. under "HISTORY EXPANSION":
(see Prompt Expansion in zshmisc(1))

But I couldn't find such a section, instead I found a section named
"EXPANSION OF PROMPT SEQUENCES"

This causes lost time searching for the wrong term.

Cheers,
