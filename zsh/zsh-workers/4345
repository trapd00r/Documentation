The zsh makefiles fail on platforms that actually have /bin/sh,
such as AIX. On linux, /bin/sh is a symlink to bash. The problem
appears to be the *test -n '$(SUBDIR)' ;... syntax used in the
recursive-clean target.

Can anyone tell me how to specify a ./configure option that will
change the $SHELL assignment in the makefiles from /bin/sh to
some other shell?

Thanks.
