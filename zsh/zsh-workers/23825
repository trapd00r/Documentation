Subject: oggenc tabcompletion itch
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Content-Disposition: inline

The options completion for oggenc wants options like -q 3 with a
space, but oggenc accepts -q3 without a space happily too. Being lazy
i usually type -q3 without the space, but then oggenc -q3 <tab>
completes {1..10} instead of filenames, which is my issue.
Is there any easy way to modify the _vorbis completion file to fix
this? (probably also applies to all the other options, though i use
them more rarely).
the line for -q in _vorbis looks like
      '(-q --quality)'{-q,--quality=}'[set encoding
quality]:quality:(0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10)' \
and is sent to _arguments -s
