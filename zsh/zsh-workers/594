I've lost track of the baseline, but in Zoltan's releases the behaviour of
cd/pushd/popd is largely defined by a patch of mine which I don't think
has changed recently.  The intended (and, for me, the observed) behaviour
is that with PUSHD_TO_HOME set neither cd nor pushd swap the top two dirs.
Without PUSHD_TO_HOME, pushd swaps, but cd doesn't.

After my patch, PUSHD_TO_HOME seems a fairly unnecessary option. I'd
like to get rid of it.  But perhaps some people rely on it in scripts.
