Beyond this you would need some sort of a script, including 
conditionals, to solve the problem as you have described it (roughly 
equal sized, independent archives).

I want to zip up 50 or so very large files into 4 huge zip files.

The problem is that the files themselves are all very different
sizes, I want to find a way of splitting up the list of files into
four lists so that the size of the resulting zips are roughly the
same size. 
(I don't want to use split zips)
