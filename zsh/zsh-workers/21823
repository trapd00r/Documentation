    Hi Bart :)

    First of all, thanks for your patches :)

    The first patch (the "defensive" patch) does not help here, it
has no effect at least in the way I'm reproducing the problem
(exactly with the code snippet I posted yesterday in the list, using
zsh -f).

    BUT the second patch certainly prevents the infinite loop.
Unfortunately it doesn't avoid the crash nor the screen messup.
I cannot reproduce the crash, unfortunately :(( It happens randomly
after the screen messup, sometimes after the first keypress after the
menu completion ends, other times after playing with the keyboard for
a while :(

    I'm gonna try your third patch and I'll answer about it in that
thread.

    Thanks a lot for being trying to solve my problem.
