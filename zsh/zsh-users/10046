Subject: Starting replace-string minibuffer in Vi command-mode
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable
Content-Disposition: inline

Hi!

I like having the replace-string function, but as I invoke it from Vi
command-mode (through a binding to ":s") the minibuffer will also be
in Vi command-mode when I'm expecting Vi insert-mode.  Is there a way
to get around this?  Is there even a way to do it with the current
implementation of read-from-minibuffer/"zle recursive-edit"?

Thanks.
