} What is the rationale for disallowing an empty indicator?

Probably so that you can declare it as a local without having to
explicitly unset it afterwards.

You can get the effect you want with something like

PROMPT_EOL_MARK='%{%}'

or

PROMPT_EOL_MARK='%<<'

In fact because prompt expansion is applied to PROMPT_EOL_MARK *before*
the precmd functions are called, there are all sorts of interesting side
effects I hadn't previously considered ...
