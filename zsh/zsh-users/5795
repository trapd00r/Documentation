Oops, you're right.  Sorry, I guess I haven't used bash for so long that I
forgot that :-)

But still, the fact that the bash prompt is ugly doesn't justify that the
default zsh prompt has to be ugly, too.  Besides I wasn't only talking
about the prompt.  All the nice features of zsh have to be turned on
manually first which I think is a shame.

But it seems that everyone on the list is happy and you don't want to
"convert" bash users to zsh.  Well, I don't care, just wanted to help with
an idea. :-(

Chau,
 Andy.
