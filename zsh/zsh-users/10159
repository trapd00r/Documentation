The relevant sections from zshparam(1):

  MAIL   If this parameter is set and mailpath is not set, the shell looks for
         mail in the specified file.
 
  MAILCHECK
         The interval in seconds between checks for new mail.
 
  mailpath <S> <Z> (MAILPATH <S>)
         An array (colon-separated list) of filenames to check for new
         mail.  Each filename can be followed by a `?' and a message
         that will be printed.  The message will undergo parameter
         expansion, command  substi- tution  and arithmetic expansion
         with the variable $_ defined as the name of the file that has
         changed.  The default message is `You have new mail'.  If an
         element is a directory instead of a file  the  shell will
         recursively check every file in every subdirectory of the
         element.

IIRC to just disable mailchecking you set MAILCHECK=0.
