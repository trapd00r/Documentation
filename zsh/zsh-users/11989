That's probably --enable-multibyte or it won't have an effect.

This seems to be different from other Linux systems where the
appropriate bits are in ncurses.

It sounds like we need to be searching for ncursesw, a subject that's
come up before a propos of MacOS (and I was asking about at the start of
the week).  Clint thinks in that case we need -I/usr/include/ncursesw,
so it may not be entirely trivial.

The dl library should be picked up later if it's needed, but that won't
work if it's causing linking with ncursesw to fail.
