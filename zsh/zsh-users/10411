You should have said that earlier...

!!:l

will turn the whole previous line into lower case.  Do you only want a
certain range of words?  You can do tricks like:

% ECHO THIS NEXT WORD IS UPPERCASE
zsh: command not found: ECHO
% !!:-:l !!:$
% echo this next word is UPPERCASE

The word selector - is short for 1- which is short for 1 to the word
before the last.  The word selector $ is the last word.  So you get all
but the last word in lower case, then the next word as it was.
