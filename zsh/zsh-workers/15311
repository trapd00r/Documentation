Ehh ... path=($path .)

It completes only commands in path; that is correct and expected.

Do you mean, that under Cygwin local directory is always implicitly in
path (it is in DOS)?

What do you mean exactly? Zsh hashes path by calling readdir(). I do *not*
want readdir return foo if real file name is foo.exe. There is nothing
Cygwin can do (at least, I cannot think of anything).

May be in case of foo.exe we should not hash foo.exe but just foo. That
seems logical.
