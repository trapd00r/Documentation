I've put together the final 3.0.0 release but before I release it I'd like
some other people to try it.  At the moment only the patch is available on
ftp://ftp.cs.elte.hu/pub/zsh/testing/zsh-3.0-pre6-final-3.0.0.diff.gz

The file date/size:

   18774 Aug 14 19:07 zsh-3.0-pre6-final-3.0.0.diff.gz

MD5 checksum:

61fcbbcdb9f032525bdaf51de99314ac  zsh-3.0-pre6-final-3.0.0.diff.gz

Do not forget to touch stamp-h.in and configure after patching.

The final zsh-3.0.0 will be released tomorrow and on Friday I'll leave for
a one-week holiday.

Cheers,

Zoltan
