Right.  That lacks ambiguity because multiple distinct parameters can't
have the same name.  But that ambiguity is missing in

    for i in in in; do ....

Do you set $i to "in" and "in" or do you set $i and $in set to "in" and ""?
Posix presumably would simply use the first interpretation, and if you want
something like the second, just don't use a parameter named in?  Or am I
missing the disambiguation?
