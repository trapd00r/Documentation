Oliver and I just got this from Kevin Sullivan, who currently only has
read-only access to this list.  Thanks for the info Kevin.  Presumably
noone has any problems with Oliver taking over the web pages.  Might
it be worth relocating them to sourceforge too?

I am currently one of the people that is supposedly in charge of the
web page. However, due to a few problems, one being way overextended,
I have failed to maintain a proper consistency on the pages. I also
cannot mail the list since sunsite.auc.dk refuses my domain because of ORBS. 
Sigh... Please, feel free to update the pages. Here is what I have
been using to access the pages. 

cvs -d :pserver:kevins@sunsite.auc.dk:/pack/anoncvs login
cvs -d :pserver:kevins@sunsite.auc.dk:/pack/anoncvs checkout zsh

You need to speak with Karsten Thygesen at <karthy@sunsite.auc.dk> in
order to get a login and specify a password. He has been pretty
incommunicado lately.
