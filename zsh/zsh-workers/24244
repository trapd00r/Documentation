Hi all,

I am getting these warning from yodl lately,

expn.yo:1065: No macro: time(...)
calsys.yo:494: No macro: timeNL(...)
calsys.yo:494: No macro: warntimeNL(...)
calsys.yo:494: No macro: warnstrNL(...)
calsys.yo:494: No macro: rpttimeNL(...)
calsys.yo:494: No macro: rptstrNL(...)

Any ideas?

Regards,
