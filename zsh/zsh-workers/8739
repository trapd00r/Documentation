Subject: Save/reset traps problem

I had a look at the traps question, but I'll have to look at it again
because it's complicated.  My impression at the moment is that the
change in 7349, which fixed a bug with TRAPQUIT, also stopped
function-type traps from being unset as traps (although not as
functions),
which you can see by comparing with the call to unsettrap() for the
non-function style.  One of the reasons this is so complicated is
because the two styles are implemented differently.  My memory of
how it actually should work is hazy at the moment, but I'll try
and refresh it.
