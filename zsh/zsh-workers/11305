Subject: `typeset -U' and exported tied parameters
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

This has something to do with the FPATH problem (11281 et al.), but I still
don't know precisely what.

zagzig% echo $ZSH_VERSION
3.1.7-pre-3
zagzig% MANPATH=/usr/man:/usr/man:/usr/man 
zagzig% printenv MANPATH
/usr/man:/usr/man:/usr/man
zagzig% print $manpath
/usr/man /usr/man /usr/man
zagzig% typeset -U manpath
zagzig% printenv MANPATH
/usr/man:/usr/man:/usr/man
zagzig% print $MANPATH
/usr/man
zagzig% print $manpath
/usr/man

Note that although `typeset -U' has changed both the array and the tied
parameter, it has failed to update the exported copy of the tied parameter.

zagzig% MANPATH=$MANPATH
zagzig% printenv MANPATH
/usr/man
