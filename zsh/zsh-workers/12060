} any other expansions possible.

On further investigation, I find I'm wrong about this, too; I misread the
last part of _expand where the compadd commands are performed.

The original completion already IS being added in a separate completion
group; the only thing you need to do to have it always listed last is

    zstyle ':completion:*' group-name ''

If you don't like that behavior for regular completion, limit it:

    zstyle ':completion:*:expand:*' group-name ''
