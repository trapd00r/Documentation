That's wrong. get_pty() has two threads - one is
executed in parent (master) and one in child after fork
(slave). So, sfd descriptor is opened just once in
child and fix looks applicable. I've tried it on my
Unix as well without any obvious ill effects.

Anyway, I suggested to put it under ifdef __CYGWIN__
for the time being to avoid last-time breaking on other
systems. It does fix things under Cygwin (it is nice to
convince Cygwin folks to change O_NOCTTY semantics of
course).
