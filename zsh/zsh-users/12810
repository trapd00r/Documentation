Well, I'm glad that I accidentally described what you're looking
for. :)

Just keep in mind that nonomatch won't do what you seem to want in your
'find' example.  Suppose the current working directory contains the
following files:

   aaa bbb ccc.so ddd.so eee.so subdir

... where 'subdir' is the top of a directory tree containing many other
*.so files.

If you have 'setopt nonomatch' and you issue the following command ...

  find . -type f -name *.so

... that command will be expanded like this before it is executed:

  find . -type f -name ccc.so ddd.so eee.so

It will then not give you what you're looking for.
