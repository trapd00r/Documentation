Thanks a lot.  I use v4.0.2 on Linux/x86 and had to
change the  "VAR+=STHG" line to "VAR=${VAR}STHG", and
similarly for the array, after I patched and it worked
like magic.  The same thing also worked for v4.0.6 on
SunOS/sparc and v4.0.6 on Cygwin_NT-5.0,Win2k/x86. 
Nothing broken so far.

Sorry about the ersatz OS/CPU terminology.

Regards,
