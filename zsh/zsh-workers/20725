} Hmm, sounds like a could work around this thing by swapping _expand and 
} _complete?

Yes, although that may mean you don't get expansions in all the cases

I think there's a bug in _expand, because the value of the accept-exact
style doesn't seem to have any effect on this particular example, and it
should.
