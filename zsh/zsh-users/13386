 FWIW I can confirm that some vi users (that is, at least me) do strongly
prefer being at the end of line. It's rather subjective, of course, but
here is an attempt at an objective explanation:

 If you want to execute a different command with the same arguments it's
usually faster to just type "anothercommand $_" but if you want to change
something near the end of line pressing the up arrow and editing the
previous command line is more convenient.

 To summarize, please don't change this to ksh behaviour which is IMO much
less convenient.

 Thanks,
VZ
