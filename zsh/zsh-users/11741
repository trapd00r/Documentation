No, please not - that would be a stupid configuration.

There's a reason why mail clients provide different types of reply,
like:

* reply       -> reply to a message (usually that's to the sender only)
* group-reply -> reply to all recipients
* list-reply  -> reply to specified mailing list

Just google for "List Reply-To considered harmful" for more
information.
