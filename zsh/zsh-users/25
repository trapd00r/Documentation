Um, this was my (temporary) patch.

Yes, I didn't muck with the configure script. So autoconf most likely
detects you have strtol, and decides not to use zstrtol (which the
patch implies). So, you need to follow the comment near the beginning
of the patch:

  strtol) and adjusts configure accordingly. I did nothing w.r.t. the
  configure script, i.e., if configure detects you have strtol, you
  will have to manually edit config.h and undef the HAVE_STRTOL line:

  /* Define if you have the strtol function.  */
  /* #define HAVE_STRTOL 1 */

i.e., check the file `config.h' and make sure the above line is
commented out (manually edit it). 

Let me know if it still doesn't work, and I'll see what I can
find. I'm running it under Solaris-2.3/gcc-2.5.8 (similar to your
setup) with no problems.
