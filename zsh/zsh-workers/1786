I've seen several messages discussing 3.0-pre4, but the only message from
Zoltan that I've seen is the one saying that he'd put a broken version on
the FTP site prematurely and nobody should pick it up.

Is the real one there now?  Did I fail to get the official announcement?
There's a pre4.tar.gz on math.gatech.edu but no corresponding patch ...
