Peter Stephenson <pws@csr.com> typed:
:                                    So here's the patch to remove the
: MAXJOB definition and make the size dynamic, eliminating those `job
: table full or recursion limit exceeded' messages during complex
: completions.

Patch looks good to me.

Regards,
Geoff
