Just missed this when I sent my last message.  Here's a patch noting a
couple of machine issues for 3.1.5*.  Anyone got any more?

  	To avoid this, make sure you compile zsh without any reference
  	to /usr/ucblib in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH.  You can easily do this
  	by just unsetting LD_LIBRARY_PATH before building zsh.

+ 	dynamically loaded libraries; avoid using --enable-zsh-mem
+ 	with --enable-dynamic.
