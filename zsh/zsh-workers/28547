Ah, but backticks were already present in the shell.  The conflict is
with "How did this $'with " embedded' parse before $'existed'?"

} But when I worked in bash I knew nothing about $'...' (because I
} even did not know where to find documentation to tweak my inputrc).

Entirely understandable nowadays, but much of the zsh doc was written
when zsh was always the shell to which someone switched from another
shell with which they were already familiar.  That's not the case as
often any more now that zsh is packaged with several OS dists, and is
not the case for $'...', but the tendency to write that way remains.
