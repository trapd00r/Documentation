I've uploaded 4.2.3 to ftp.zsh.org.

This fixes a compilation problem on MacOS noticed by Oliver and also the
fact that the Mac completions aren't installed by default.  There are a
couple of very minor other changes but users who aren't on the Mac
otherwise can stick with 4.2.2.

This version will almost certainly go to Sourceforge, too.
