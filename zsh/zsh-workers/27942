Committed this one. Actually checking whether the head symbols are
available at any time probably requires something like this:

    gdir=3D"$(git rev-parse --git-dir)"
    [[ -f ${gdir}/ORIG_HEAD ]] && ...
    [[ -f ${gdir}/FETCH_HEAD ]] && ...
    ...

I don't know if it's worth the additional fork.
