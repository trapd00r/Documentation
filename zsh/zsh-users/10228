Just to point out you can combine the two in the same expression in zsh.
As soon as you've extracted a single element, later suffixes work on
characters.  (One day this may be multibyte characters but that's not done
yet.)

% array=(one two three four)
% print ${array[3][2,-2]}
hre

Since the rule is applied after every subscript match, you can do bizarre
stuff like:

% print ${array[1,3][-1][2,-2][2]}
r

which works in the following steps:

array  one two three four -> [1,3]
array  one two three -> [-1]
scalar three -> [2,-2]
scalar hre -> [2]
scalar r
