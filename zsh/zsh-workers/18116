    OK, then, that's the solution :)) Thanks a lot :)

    Yes, the problem is noequals, I discovered after sending the
message. I can live with side effects, of course, but the problem is
that I cannot tell the script users to set appropriate options when
running this on their systems. The better solution is to quote the
character. Thanks a lot :)))
