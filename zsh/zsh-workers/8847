Subject: on AIX, builds zsh.xxx.so
X-Received: By mailgate.Cadence.COM as BAA23459 at Thu Dec  2 01:20:38 1999


	on AIX, default makefiles build a zsh.xxx.so.
	What changes do i do to make is statically linked.
	(or at least give it a -R //path// while building zsh).
	I don't want to mess around with LD_LIBRARY_PATH, which is
	already a mess in my current config.
TIA
Vardhan.
