I just tried a huge `print -l /usr/**/*' where zsh swallowed up 40 Mbytes.
This worked and the shell successfully freed the memory afterwards.  So
it doesn't look this is simple problem with the heap allocator.

I don't have zsh's malloc compiled in (as it screws up valgrind), so
that might be a problem.

Otherwise, it may be triggering some unpleasant corner case.  Adding
more detailed debugging checks to mem.c might help for that.
