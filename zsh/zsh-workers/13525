Subject: Re: zsh appears to be eating characters when called with -c

Okay, this appears to be caused by the Meta character being interpreted. 
This portion of the command string:

0x83aa 0xe383 0xbce3 0x82b9 0xe382 0x9920

gets munged into:

0x8ae3 0x9ce3 0x82b9 0xe382 20

So, the 0x83aa gets turned into 0xaa ^ 32 (0x8a), the 0x83bc gets turned 
into 0x9c, and the 0x99 (Dnull) is summarily dispatched.

matt.
