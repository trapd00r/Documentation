I don't understand what exactly do you want.  Original code
offers changed files relative to repository root.  Other files
offered relative to current directory.

My path does two things.  First, it makes "changed files" paths
to be relative to current directory, so git-commit accepts these
paths.  Second, it allows to complete paths outside of current
directory, which current code does not allow.

After my "relativisation" generated paths are split at '/' by
_multi_parts, I haven't changed this behavior.
