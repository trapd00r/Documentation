The 'separate counters for each person' sounds
like a hash to me, and was suggested by others.

However I think a text processing tool would be
more appropriate than a shell for this kind of
task:

% perl -ne 'BEGIN { %person=(); } \
          /^([a-zA-Z]+)(:)(.*)$/ &&  \
            print "$1" . ++$person{$1} . "$2$3\n";' < dialog.file

HTH,
