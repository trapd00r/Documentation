} In my .zshrc I am doing:

} 
} which never seems to work unless I do "source .zshrc"

This might mean that there's a different set of bindkey commands in
/etc/zlogin on your system.  It might also mean that $ZDOTDIR points
somewhere other than your home directory.

Do other commands in your .zshrc seem to work?
