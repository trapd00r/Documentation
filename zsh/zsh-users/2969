[I'm using the standard tools that came with RedHat Linux 6.1]

The zsh 3.1.6 binaries built fine, but I get the following errors from
`makeinfo':

  $ make                                                                ~/zsh-3.1.6/Doc

I don't know `texi' and `makeinfo', but like using `info' in Emacs.  Any ideas
how to fix this?

[Please Cc me on any replies, as I'm not on the mailing list]
