Pressing Ctrl-Space which sends '^@', kills zsh.

This problem has been in versions 2.6* and is still in 3.01
The problem appears only in terminals that processes the
Ctrl-Space and send '^@' to shell. For example some xterm
implementations don't send anything to shell when Ctrl-Space
is pressed and this problem is not appearing there (but there you
have problem of not being able to use Ctrl-Space for anything).

Is there something wrong with handling 'null'-character ('^@')
in zsh?  (Or is there some setting that I haven't noticed?)
