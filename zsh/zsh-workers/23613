I'm almost done with the new version, which I will post here.  Most of
the stuff is at the repository above, so if you want to continue
merging partials that's fine.  Completion for git-svn has taken quite
some time to write, as it requires a lot of settings to be completed
as well.  Hopefully I'll be able to get a complete update ready this
weekend.
