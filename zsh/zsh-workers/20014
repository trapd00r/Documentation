It is at 4.2 isn't it?

I updated it in March using the files in the downloaded
zsh-4.2.0-doc.tar.bz2 file. You generated those which is why it says
"generated by Peter Stephenson".

What makes you think it isn't the 4.2.0 manual?

It'd be best to do that by adjusting the Yodl to put it in
automatically like it does for texinfo.
