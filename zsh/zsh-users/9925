Hi, Citizens:

Is there a simple way to complete with the sort order governed by  
most recently touched file first (the order ls -t produces) rather  
than the conventional order?  Ideally I'd like to bind it to ctl-tab  
or some such key combo and retain the normal completion option with tab.

Many thanks.

Bill Scott
