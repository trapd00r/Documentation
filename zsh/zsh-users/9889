Try this:

% foo(){ echo "this is a function" }
% foo
this is a function
% vared foo()
function> echo "vared works... sort of"
% foo
vared works... sort of

If you hack something into zle to print the contents of the function
at the prompt...  maybe... 

Sorry this reply wasn't a real answer to your question! :)
