Subject: Bug with zsh 4.3.5 and umount on OpenBSD 4.3

Hello,

I use zsh 4.3.5 on OpenBSD. I updated my Notebook with OpenBSD 4.3
today. If I use the umount command and want to complete the directory
name from the mountpoint, i became a error message.

For example:
umount /mn<Press Tab>readlink: unknown option -- q
usage: readlink [-fn] file
readlink: unknown option -- q
usage: readlink [-fn] file

It looks like the zsh want to use the command readlink with the option
-q which don't exist on OpenBSD Systems.

This doesn't happen with zsh 4.2 on my old OpenBSD 4.2 System.

What can i do to use the completion without the readlink errors?

Greetings
René Maroufi
