Hi,

I wrote a function, which is included in a file ("~/.zsh.functions"),
which itsself is sourced at the very bottom of my .zshrc.

This functions is defined as follows:
lww () {
        setopt
        if [ ! -z $1 ]
        then
                echo
                case `whence -w $1 | cut -d' ' -f 2` in
                        (alias) whence -v $1 ;;
                        (builtin) echo "$1 is a  builtin" ;;
                        (command) echo "$1 is a command:"
                                ls -l `whence $1` ;;
                        (function) echo "$1 is a function:"
                                whence -f $1 ;;
                        (hashed) echo "$1 is hashed!"
                                return ;;
                        (reserved) echo "$1 is a reserved word!"
                                return ;;
                        (none) echo "$1 is not found!" ;;
                        (default) echo "### ERROR" ;;
                esac
                cmdarray=("${(f)$(whence -pa $1)}")
                echo ${#cmdarray}                     ## 1
                echo ${(F)cmdarray}
                typeset -U cmdarray
                echo ${#cmdarray}                     ## 2
                echo ${(F)cmdarray}
                cmdarray=(${(o)cmdarray})
                echo ${#cmdarray}                     ## 3
                echo ${(F)cmdarray}
                if [[ ${#cmdarray} -ne 0 ]]
                then
                        echo ${(F)cmdarray}
                fi
        fi
}

The echos are for debugging purposes only.

When I do a "lww ls" from the commandline only the echoes at "##1"
(added later) are printing
3
/bin//ls
/bin/ls
/usr/bin/ls

The following echoes are printing:
0




But!
When doeing a 

set - ls

and then cut'n'paste the body of the function lww to the commandline,
all three "echo"-groups are reporting:
3
/bin//ls
/bin/ls
/usr/bin/ls

and then function works.

"setopt" in the head of the funtion and setopt from the commandline
are reporting the same options set.

Where is the bug I do not recognize/realize ? Am I blind ? ;)

Thank you very much for any help in advance!
Slightly confused,
mcc
