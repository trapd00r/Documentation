This may be a totally unrealistic idea, but in principle it works
nicely (I think):

How about an option which intercepts command-line processing just
before spelling correction is invoked, and checks whether the word
under suspicion of incorrect spelling belongs to the list of
completions for that context?  E.g.

% perldoc -f pos
zsh: correct 'pos' to 'os' [nyae]? n

would never happen, because `pos' is in the list of completions in the
:complete::perldoc::-f-1 context.  It might slow things down too much
for some people's tastes, but would it be worth implementing anyway?
