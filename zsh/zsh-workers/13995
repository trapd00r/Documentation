Subject: Example from manual seems broken
X-Mailer: VM 6.90 under 21.2  (beta46) "Urania" XEmacs Lucid


1. The following example from zshexpn.1 FILENAME_EXPANSION is broken in
   zsh-4.0.1-pre-3:

    zsh -f
    $> setopt extendedglob
    $> foo="a string with a message"
    $> if [[ $foo = (a|an)' '(#b)(*)' '* ]]; then
    then> print ${foo[$mbegin[1],$mend[1]]}
    then> fi
    $> zsh: bad math expression: operand expected at `$mend[1]'

    print ${foo[$mbegin[1],15]}
     and
    print ${foo[3,$mend[1]]}
     work fine.

2. I've got _normal complaining about _use_lo not being found after
   upgrading from dev-2 to dev-3.

    $> objdump --<C-d>
    _use_lo not found at _normal:100

    _use_lo from dev-2 works fine.

3. I'm sorry, I wasn't paying attention: why are the completion functions
   in new sub-subdirectories in source, but amalgamated in --fndir ?

Thanks,

/f
