Vincent Lefevre <Vincent.Lefevre@ens-lyon.fr> typed:
:For instance, if I type "rm blah/*", zsh asks:
:zsh: sure you want to delete all the files in /home/vlefevre/blah [yn]?
:But if I resize the xterm, zsh considers that I've typed [return],
:though I haven't typed anything. Could this be fixed?
:(This is with zsh 3.1.5)

Reproduced in 3.1.5. Couldn't reproduce in 3.1.5-pws-7
