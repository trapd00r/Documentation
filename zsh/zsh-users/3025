This is done with if statements normally. All you need is:

if [[ "$var" = pattern ]]; then

Make sure that you don't quote the pattern otherwise it won't work.

The problem here is that you use the _expand completer with completions
1 but glob 0 and substitute 0. The _expand completer is expanding all
the completions on the command line. In general, I would only want to
use completions 1 with a more specific context. Probably your best bet
is to remove _expand from your list of completers but if you want it,
then try reading the appropriate sections of Peter's Zsh Guide (try
'User-friendly users guide' from the zsh web pages if you don't know
where to find it).
