There is a problem I have on my machine with nearly every shell
with pasting large amounts into the shell.  At one time I made a
quick aborted effort into searching for it.  I wondered if it was
to do with ungetting characters unsafely but haven't fixed my
thinking as that being the cause for the buffer overwriting.  It needs
a larger amount of data (not, say, < 200 chars as reported in the Irix
case) before I'm likely to see it.  Many other applications don't show
it, e.g.  vim in the shell will work fine.  My normal check here is
select a screen worth into the cut buffer then type "echo '" and paste.
It'll beep at me (several times) and lose most of the stuff.

Anyway, I'll make another look for it soon (i.e. not today).

Regards,
