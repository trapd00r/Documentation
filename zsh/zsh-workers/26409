If _subversion were modified to use the caching layer, it could
invalidate the cache if .svn/entries were newer.  Otherwise,
I can only imagine something like recording $EPOCHSECONDS when
the array is set and then statting .svn/entries, or doing away
with the cache altogether.

I would suggest that somebody else work on this, as I still hate
svn.
