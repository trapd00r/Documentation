ml is being incremented by 2 for each line, and mrestlines is being
decremented by 2 for each line.

Here's what's happening with ml:

657 clnicezputs:ml++ from 5 to 6
1346 compprintlist:ml += mlprinted(1) from 5 to 6
1370 compprintlist:ml++ from 6 to 7
1341 clprintm called with ml, and eventually clnicezputs:ml set to 7
657 clnicezputs:ml++ from 7 to 8

Not sure what the logic is here.
