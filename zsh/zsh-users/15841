Hi
I'm often diffing two files with a glob knowing that only 2 files match.
say index.php and index2.php

so when I type 
> diff index*
I can assume that I will get, (but it will always be as clear)

> diff index.php index2.php

but is there an option to force diff to output the names of actual files 
compared?

(Having posed myself the problem I've realized that I can always tab expand)

> diff index*<TAB>
