Probably. I seem to remember seeing such a variable somewhere so there
may be a standardish name. It might be worth having a look at libtool
and imake to see if they have such a variable. Not that libtool is very
good at handling systems other than Linux - it doesn't use IRIX's kernel
DSO versioning for instance.

I can't see that libzsh is any different to any other shared objects.

Does zsh_SEARCH_LIBS really need to do everything with AC_TRY_LINK_FUNC
then - couldn't it just save and restore LIBS and use AC_SEARCH_LIBS?
That said, I haven't looked at your change in detail so may be missing
the point. I agree with Andrej that we should be careful about these
changes before 4.0.1 because of the potential to break the compile on a
particular platform. It seems to be adding quite a bit of complexity. Do
redundant libraries in LIBS matter much? If I remember correctly, IRIX
displays a warning but doesn't actually link the library in.
