Subject: missing Parameter Expansion Flag?
To: zsh-users@sunsite.dk

let's say i set a string to print "xxxyyy" with the "xxx" in the default 
color and the "yyy" in red:
 	foo="xxx${fg[red]}yyy"

which results in:
 	print ${foo}
 	xxxyyy

 	print ${(V)foo}
 	xxx^[[31myyy

in the first example above, the "yyy" is red.

now, let's say i want to count the characters in that string:
 	print ${#foo}
 	11

and of course, i can expand the meta-chars, and count the result of that:
 	print ${#${(V)foo}}
 	12

*but* i don't see how to count the string so that it just counts the 
printing characters (xxxyyy). i want to count it so the count returns 6, 
which is how many printable characters are in the string. intuitively, i 
would think there should be a parameter expansion flag to do that, but i 
can't find it. is there another (good*) way? should there be a flag for 
that?

* good, above, means i don't want to filter out characters based on ascii 
values.
