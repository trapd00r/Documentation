} Maybe we can `solve' (or, rather, circumvent) this problem by being more

} That way, users can even use cut&paste to make the job running.

} Any better wording?  Should we print the `kill ...' indented on its own
} line?

I think it's OK as it is, at least until we get some empirical feedback.

What about my other suggestion, that `%job &!' should use `bg' and then
handle the job table in exec.c ?
