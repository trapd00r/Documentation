I'd prefer, if possible, to back them off everywhere and apply them back
later.  The only good reason for using a branch would be to do simultaneous
development.  I don't think that's necessary so near to the 4.0.1 release.

Once this is dealt with, unless anyone still has remaining tweaks they
think are necessary, I shall make a final pre-release with a view to
releasing it as 4.0.1.
