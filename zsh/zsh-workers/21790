 CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
 =====================
 
+Multibyte character support
+---------------------------
+
+Support for multibyte character sets that extend ASCII, such as UTF-8, is
+under development but the code in the line editor is sufficiently stable to
+be turned on by default in environments that provide full ISO 10646 support
+including the preprocessor definition __STDC_ISO_10646__.
+
+The support can be explicitly enabled or disable with --enable-multibyte or
+--disable-multibyte.  Reports of systems where multibyte support was not
+enabled by default but --enable-multibyte resulted in a usable shell would
+be appreciated.  The developers are not aware of any need to use
+--disable-multibyte and this should be reported as a bug.
+
+The main shell is not yet aware of multibyte characters, so for example the
+length of a scalar parameter will return the number of bytes, not
+characters, and pattern tests likewise treat single bytes as if they were
+characters.  This means that pattern tests such as ? and [[:alpha:]] do not
+work correctly with characters in multibyte character sets beyond the ASCII
+subset.

 CHANGES FROM PREVIOUS VERSIONS OF ZSH
 -------------------------------------
 
-Changes since zsh version 4.2.0
--------------------------------
+Major changes between versions 4.2 and 4.3
+------------------------------------------
+
+- There is support for multibyte character sets in the line editor,
+  though not the main shell.  See Multibyte Character Support in INSTALL.
+
+- New option PROMPT_SP, on by default, to work around the problem that the
+  line editor can overwrite output with no newline at the end.
+
+- New option HIST_SAVE_BY_COPY (on by default): history is saved by
+  copying and renaming instead of directly overwriting.
+
+- New redirection syntax e.g. {myfd}>file opens a new file descriptor
+  and stores the number in $myfd, so that >&$myfd will work.  Chosen
+  not to break existing code.
+
+- New Posix-style zsh-specific tests [[:IDENT:]], [[:IFS:]],
+  [[:IFSSPACE:]], [[:WORD:]] test if character can appear in identifier,
+  is an IFS character, is an IFS whitespace character, or is considered
+  as part of a word (is alphanumeric or appears in $WORDCHARS).  Note
+  the pattern code doesn't yet handle multibyte characters.
+
+- The idiom =(<<<...) optimised so that the shell internally turns
+  the ... into the contents of a file whose name is then substituted.
+
+- As always, many enhancements to completion functions.
+
+Changes in 4.2 since version 4.2.0

 - The autoload and related builtins take options -k and -z to indicate
   ksh or zsh autoloading style for given functions, making it possible
