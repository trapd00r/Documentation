:Blech.  It looks legal to me.

Ummm, how?  None of the versions I have have makepro.awk .  What version is
this from?  Have I been asleep and this has suddenly appeared?

:>is this my version of nawk being crap?
:Maybe.  Try mawk or gawk -- both of them handle the script fine.  Also,
:please send a bug report to <zsh-workers@math.gatech.edu> -- there will
:be some awk experts there that can fix the script.

Please send us the script first :-)
