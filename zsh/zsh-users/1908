yes I am. 3.1.5 compiles and runs just fine on Solaris 2.5.1. It
compiles under IRIX 6.4 but I see similar problems to Helmut....

For instance, 

3:10PM arif@amethyst% ./Src/zsh -f /tmp/z
/tmp/z: unmatched ' [2]
3:10PM arif@amethyst% cat /tmp/z            

PS1='%t %n@%m%# '

3:10PM arif@amethyst% 

The version I am successfully running on IRIX at the moment is 3.1.2
and that runs the file just fine.

3:10PM arif@amethyst% zsh -f /tmp/z  
3:10PM arif@amethyst% 

I can try to look into it - suggestions of where to start?

			Anthony.
