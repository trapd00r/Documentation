My understanding is that ~/.zshenv is for hacking in situations
where you can't do otherwise.

Your X login procedure should source your .zprofile or some file
that is sourced by your .zprofile if you want the same settings
in X sessions and non-X sessions. Or it should source/read
another session config file that defines env variables.

.zshenv is to fix up situations where it's not possible in my
opinion. It's like the SHELLOPTS, BASH_ENV variables with bash
or ENV with some kshs, it should be used with extreme care and
probably not permanently.

Now, that's one way to see things. You can have a different
approach where .zshenv is central, but my feeling is that it's
asking for trouble.
