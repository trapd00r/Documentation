This looks like a bug to me...  Using current CVS zsh.

zsh -f
autoload -U compinit; compinit -C
zstyle ':completion:*' matcher-list 'r:|[ ]=** r:[^a-z]||[a-z]=**'
mkdir bug; cd bug
touch "steve green" "steve morrow" "peter stephenson"
more st<TAB>
peter\ stephenson  steve\ green       steve\ morrow
more ./st<TAB>

The first case looks correct.  Though when I type <TAB> in the last case, it
deletes the "st" and my line looks like: "more ./"  I'm guessing it might be
_path_files, because I get the error when it includes a leading path.

-FR.
