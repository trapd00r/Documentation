Subject: Unexpected "unknown file attribute" error
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

For obscure reasons, one of the machines I use at work has this function
in root's .zshrc:

function add-dir {
    which=$1
    shift
    foreach dir ($*) {
        eval $which=(\${$which} \$dir)
    }
}

This used to work in 3.0.x, but now that I've installed 4.0.4, it fails with

add-dir:4: unknown file attribute

Why isn't the space inside the parens enough to keep them from being treated
as a glob qualifier?  It used to be.
