Subject: AIX - getting dynamic modules working

Several questions:

   1) I've tried setting $LDFLAGS in the environment and
      running configure, but $LDFLAGS does not make it into
      the Makefile(s).

      Let me know the best way to pass in linker commands
      to configure.

   2) Has anyone tried to change the zsh makefiles to use
      libtool. If so, send me your makefiles, as this is
      probably a better place to start.

Thanks.
