In the same way I reported in my previous message: it hangs after
printing the first prompt.  Solaris 2.4, SS20, X11R5.  This is before
and after applying the patch CC'ed to me.

Didn't know it had that reputation generally.  I'll probably wait and
use 2.3.1 until then.

2.3.1 works OK for me except for a few scoping bugs which I have
reported, the fact that it hangs when certain pipelines are
interrupted, which I think is known, and very minor bugs.  Just hoping
a newer version will be faster.
