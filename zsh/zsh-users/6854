Then please test :-)

It will always work on a real and recent enough unix variant. BeOS is
POSIX-like enough, but does not support all the aspects of job control
(apparently).

This is against the autoconf philosophy of testing things rather than
assuming them for a given platform.

You're the one who wanted this option for your build system. I've
accomodated you ;-) For me, failing when not running on a terminal
(which is a corner case for 99.99% (made out figure) of zsh's users)
is perfectly acceptable option.
