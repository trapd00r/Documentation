That means you have function, as well as an alias, defined to ls().  It's
possible to have both, but only the function can fill your job table and
needs the `command ls' inside it.  (Also, remember the catch: if you define
an alias for ls, and the function next with 'ls() {...}', the alias
gets expanded in the definition, causing havoc.)

This should certainly work.  I can only think of checking paths, value
of $LS_OPTIONS, symbolic links, everything you've probably thought of.
