Hi,

	I'm trying to compile v3.1.3 of Zsh.  I've successfully compiled
version 3.1.2 and others in the past by simply typing
	configure --prefix=./new/
and then
	make
which successfully creates the executable.

With v3.1.3, I run configure and it ends with the message:

creating ./config.status
creating Makefile
Can't open :Makefile.in
creating Doc/Makefile
Can't open :Doc/Makefile.in
creating Etc/Makefile
Can't open :Etc/Makefile.in
creating Src/Makefile
Can't open :Src/Makefile.in
creating config.h
cat: cannot open :config.h.in
config.h is unchanged

zsh configuration
-----------------
zsh version               : 3.1.3
host operating system     : sparc-sun-solaris2.5.1
source code location      : .
compiler                  : gcc
executable compiler flags :  -Wall -Wno-implicit -Wmissing-prototypes -O2
executable linker flags   :   -s 
binary install path       : ./new//bin
man page install path     : ./new//man
info install path         : ./new//info


With the previous versions I did not get these "can't open" errors.
If I type "ls *.in" I see:

-rw-------   1 monroem  graduate     3486 Apr 30 16:55 Makefile.in
-rw-------   1 monroem  graduate    12903 Apr 28 19:34 config.h.in
-rw-------   1 monroem  graduate    31754 Apr 30 18:03 configure.in
-rw-------   1 monroem  graduate        1 Apr 30 18:09 stamp-h.in

so it looks like the files were created just fine.  Any suggestions?

		Thanks,
		Matt
