Before I dig further into it, has anyone come across a similar problem:

        > zsh
        % cat
        ^Z
        segmentation fault
        > 

Note that the outer shell here is tcsh because if I try it from within zsh, the
outer shell is also killed (actually if I try it from within 10 nested zshs,
they all get killed).

This is with zsh-3.0.4 patched to 3.0.5 running on Linux-2.0.30 with
glibc-2.0.4 and compiled with

        ./configure --prefix=/softs/zsh-3.0.5
