That's just because command -v wasn't recognised as a command with an
option.  It works properly when the shell gets that far.

I think this is the answer.  It may be just an oversight.  The second
hunk now doesn't get reached, but the change seems right anyway.

The test hn == (HashNode)&commandbn now gets an error message about
`dereferencing type-punned pointer', even though it's obviously never
dereferenced.

I still don't properly understand the logic here.
