I have a vastly updated version of _git in the making.  Sadly it's
taken more than two months to put together, and it's still not done.
I wrote the initial version, which matches version 1.3 quite well.
The new one syncs _git to version 1.5.  I'm about 90% there, but until
I'm done I'm really not that interested in sending out patches -
especially considering how much has changed, both in the way of
completion and in way of git as such.

More information here:

It's been somewhat tested, but there are probably loads of bugs to weed out.
