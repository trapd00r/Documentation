I am surprised, that you get any output here. I don't get anything at all.
The problem is, that grep buffers input/output (I won't discuss, if it is a
bug or a feature). So, you won't see anything till the whole buffer is
filled. In my case grep does not do any write at all.

What do you mean? If you need to write the continous output to a file - it
is O.K. As soon, as daemon fills up the whole buffer, it will be written
off.
