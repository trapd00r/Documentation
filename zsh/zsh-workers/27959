Hi all,

I've updated the mercurial completion file _hg to reflect that most 
commands accept not only tags and revision hashs as revision parameter but 
also branch names of named branches (hg branches).

I think this patch is important for all people who do use named branches 
in their projects.

So my question is, what is the best way to contribute this enhancement?

best regards

S.Tramp
