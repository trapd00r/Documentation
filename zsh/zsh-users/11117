It's unlikely you're missing a function.  It works for me with the
latest code with zsh -f, so I suspect you just need what's in CVS.  zsh
4.3.3 should be along soon: most of the main multibyte features are now
present so it's probably a good idea to circulate.  I'll probably
produce a test version first.
