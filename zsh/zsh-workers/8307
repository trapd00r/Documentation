I've put candidates for the 3.0.7 release on ftp.brasslatern.com:/pub/zsh/.
I'm pretty confident that there's no reason to do any "test" releases for
the changes since 3.0.6, but given how alert I was last night I thought I'd
better ask that some other people check it for obvious boneheadedness before
I send it to the official ftp site.
