Tried to at work and git-apply hates the patch format. Not sure why. =
Also patch -p0 wouldn't apply it cleanly to the current top-of-git.

I can play around when I get home with applying the changes by hand, if =
you've got a .diff you can attach (to avoid copy/paste problems) or a =
git-format-patch style patch. Either would be appriciated.
