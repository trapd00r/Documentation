Dear Motoi:

As I said, they are not works of art.

In the case of the open and fink completions, I had written my own
functions but when yours were made available I saw that they were much
superior in almost every respect, but being highly impatient I hacked out
what I used for faster completions and grafted or tricked your completions
into using my hacks.

As you say, it is unlikely the best or most efficient way to do this, but
at least it is a proof of principle.

With OS X 10.4, the problem at least for _open is now much easier, and if
some clever person comes up with an instantaneous replacement for making a
call to "fink index" after every update or install command, that obviously
would be of tremendous benefit too.

For the record, I put comments like this at the top of the files that I
altered:

# Author:  Motoi Washida
# modified by W G Scott
# Nov 28, 2004 from the
# November 12 2004 CVS version

All the best,

Bill
