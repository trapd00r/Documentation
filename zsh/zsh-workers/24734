Hi,

_canonical_path is not working on freebsd, it rely on readlink which  
does work the same on BSD :
on openbsd -q options doesn't exist : umount[tab] gives readlink:  
unknown option -- q
on freebsd readlink: illegal option -- q

there is on patch on freebsd ports which uses /usr/sbin/stat that  
works but then the completion is buggy
http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/~checkout~/ports/shells/zsh/files/patch-Completion-Unix-Type-_canonical_paths?rev=1.1;content-type=text%2Fplain


umount /h[tab]
gives me umount /h/
then [tab] again gives me umount /h//

so currently the work around is to replace _canonical_path by compadd  
-a in _mount (udevordir) and it works

I can't find any clue to correct the bug myself.

Thanks
Bapt
