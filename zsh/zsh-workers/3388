:The trick there is that x is an array variable, so it produces two strings.

Yes, but I still don't get it.  ^^ should prevent expansion, shouldn't it.

  ${^spec}
	Turn on the RC_EXPAND_PARAM option  for  the evaluation  of  spec;
	if  the ^ is doubled, turn it off.  When this option is set, array
	expansions of the form foo${xx}bar, where the parameter xx is set
	to (a b c), are substituted with   fooabar   foobbar  foocbar
        instead of the default fooa b cbar.

So, it seems to me that it should be
  % echo 1${^a}
  1a 1b
  % echo 1${^a}1
  1a1 1b1
  % echo 1${^a}1${^x}
  1a1x 1a1y 1b1x 1b1y           #  in another order?
  % echo 1${^a}1${^^x}
  1a1x y 1b1x y
