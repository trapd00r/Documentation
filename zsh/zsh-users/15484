Thanks Bart.

I guess I am dreaming a bit, looking for something lighter and 
even simpler.

Looking for just some light RAM space to supplement my own consciousness.
Ideally would like to write to some buffer space in physical top 
corner of screen. Even if editing is not possible. These points
would just supplement my current task or daily todo stuff or whatever.

Possible something like this could be implemented with virtual 
terminals like screen or tmux.

Eric
