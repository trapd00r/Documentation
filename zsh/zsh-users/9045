As Dan Nelson points out, it all seems to be in order.  I don't want to
push it back at you, but perhaps your mail client is being fooled by the
mime-type of the second attachment (which was us-ascii).  Anyway, if
this problem persists, I can live without using fancy apostrophes on
this list.

OK.

Done.  I modified the function a bit to handle files named +<n> a bit
better:

_vim_files () {
  if [[ $(echo $PREFIX*(N)) == '' ]]; then
    case $PREFIX in
      (+) _message -e 'start at a given line (default: end of file)' ;;
      (+<1->) _message -e 'line number' ;;
    esac
  fi
  case $PREFIX in
    (+*) _files -P './' $* ;;
    (*) _files $* ;;
  esac
}

This may not be the best solution, though. I kind of hope that there's a
nicer way to test if there are any files having $PREFIX as a prefix.

Thank you for your help,
        nikolai
