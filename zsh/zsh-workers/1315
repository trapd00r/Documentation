Zsh uses a HISTSIZE long array to store history entries.  gethistent(X) is
defined as (histentarr+((X)%histentct)) (with proper bounds checking at
apropriate places).  This is usually the most compact representation.  A
linked list can be used but then the pointers would require extra memory.
histentarr is almost full in most cases since it is filled from $HISTFILE
upon invocation.  Most people do like to limit the number of stored history
events since loading and saving big histories takes a long time.  Of course
SAVEHIST can be smaller than HISTSIZE but most people do not issue more
than 1000 commands from one shell so HISTSIZE = SAVEHIST + 1000 should be
enough.
