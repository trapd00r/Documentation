It's something to do with using the -U argument to compadd when you've
got ambiguous completions: it works fine when there's only a single
completion.  It was triggered by adding the -U's to do approximation in
non-final path segments (even before the compmatch change).  The initial
"." is a red herring.  However, I don't know where it's going wrong
since when I do approximation after normal completion (but lots of other
options set, too) it works fine.  This triggers a different part of
_path_files which has compadd -U but slight differences in the other
arguments.  Internally the Cline struct that's used for generating the
command line looks a bit spartan in the failed case.  Needless to say I
haven't the faintest clue where this is leading.
