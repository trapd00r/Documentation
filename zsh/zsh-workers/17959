With zsh-4.0.6 on Linux (seen also with 4.0.3, as well as 4.0.5 on
Solaris):

% zsh -f
% mkdir /tmp/foo
% cd /tmp/foo
% mkdir a b
% touch a/{1,2,3,4}

% cd /tmp/foo/b
% ls ../^D
a/  b/
% ls ..//^D
a/  b/

Ok, fine.

Now

% autoload -U compinit
% compinit
% ls ../^D
a/  b/
% ls ..//^D
1   2   3   4

Oops.  Then, for good measure, hit ^C twice to quit the shell.  :)
