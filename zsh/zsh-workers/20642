This looks right to me, but I haven't groveled through that code for a 
while.  The only case where it might be wrong is in a subshell if the 
subshell is to die with the same signal as the job, but I *think* that's
handled elsewhere by the value passed to exit() ... and AFAICT from some
attempts at testing, it is.
