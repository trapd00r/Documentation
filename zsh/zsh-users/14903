Hey list,

Here's something I'm finding odd:

[snip]
zsh% : /foo/bar
zsh% print !$:s/\//l/
print lfoo/bar
lfoo/bar
zsh% baz=/foo/bar
zsh% print ${baz:s/\//l/}
zsh: unrecognized modifier
zsh% print ${baz:s,/,l,}
lfoo/bar
[snap]

I couldn't find a limitation in the manual about escaping the delimiter
in such expansions in `zshexpn(1)'. Is this a bug or am I missing
something?

Regards, Frank
