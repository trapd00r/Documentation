Why not <URL:http://sourceforge.net>?  Presuming they do what they say
(and I've no reason to doubt them), they'll provide http, cvs, mailing
lists, bug tracking and everything---and arrange for zsh.org to be
redirected, if that's what we want.  All on good hardware.  (Obviously
one can question whether this'll last for ever, but at the moment, it
looks good.)
