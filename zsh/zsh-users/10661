Hi Bart,

 thanks for the explanations. :) 

 I thought, that the input would be chained:

 (input)->mrxvt->zsh->mc

 because these apps were started in that order.

 Yes, I have changed mrxvt via the option "-m8" to produce Meta-keys
 as "binary" values (sorry, dont know, what the correct terminux
 technicus is here...) instead of key sequences.

 I thnk, I get lost here. 

 The only way seems to be an alias of that form:

 alias='mrxvt -e mc'  #...leaving off the "-m8"

 but this will popup a new window. One reason for choosing mc was,
 that it does not create a new window and runs in the current
 terminal.
 Sigh

 keep hacking!
