Hi there,

I'm sorry if this question has been asked before, but I'm new to this
list, and I could not find an answer in the FAQ.

I wonder if it is possible in zsh to emulate the tcsh's
history-search-backward and history-search-forward commands. They are
very similar to zsh history-beginning-search-backward and
history-beginning-search-forward widgets, but tcsh moves the cursor to 
the end of the line, rather than leaving it in place.

Regards,
Dima.
