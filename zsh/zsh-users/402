I'm a new user of zsh and the first thing I tried to do is to make
sure that everything that I'm used to from tcsh exists. 

The one thing that got me stuck yesterday is the ^X? command which
does a 'which ' of the last word and replaces it.

E.g.

    ls -l perl^X?
    ls -l /usr/local/bin/perl
    
Is there any way to do the same thing in zsh?
