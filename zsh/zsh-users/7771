I reread that... the internal function doisearch() is crying out to
use a special keymap and a recursive edit.  Currently the behaviour is
hardcoded onto certain widgets, which is why trying to get it to do
something unusual is difficult.

Possibly, doing it that way, you could get a better version of
history-incremental-search-backward as a shell function than the current
internal one.  However, there may be things that aren't so easy.
