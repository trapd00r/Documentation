Haha!  A quick update in case anyone is thinking about this.

The problem I've just tracked down to process limits.  csh is
initialising with the maxmimum number of file descriptors set to 64
(indeed the value of OPEN_MAX and supposedly the maximum limit
therefore for RLIMIT_NOFILE).

getrlimit(), however,  believes that the maximum number of file
descriptors is 1024, and zsh is bumping the limit up to that value.
This appears to confuse the 4.1.3 gethostbyname().

Time to complain to Sun, I think.

A

PS.  Apologies to Bart for sending a reply only to him. Didn't replies
use to go to the list rather than just the originator?
