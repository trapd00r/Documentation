} With zsh, you could solve that by having $SHELL be /path/to/user-zsh

Unfortunately I think you at least have to turn this inside-out, because
/etc/passwd usually is restricted to values that are in /etc/shells.

So something like this in .zshenv:

if [[ $0 != (*/|)user-zsh && -o interactive ]]; then
  export SHELL=~/bin/user-zsh
  # ... etc. ...
fi

But that's not going to address Vincent's complaint that shells started
for globbing by e.g. GDB should pick up settings like extended_glob.
Even SHLVL isn't always accurate; what you'd really need to do is look
up the parent process and decide based on that.
