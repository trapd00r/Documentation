yes, completely :)
I really want the gnu-linux versions of as many commands as i can
get. This ZLS_COLORS trick is known to me :)
as zsh is not for GNU only (which is good), it does not provide
enough completions for GNU commands.
ls , screen , perl (well sort of GNU :)), emacs completions, vim
and many others are missing. (of course, no ZSH distribution can
have all these commands, that would take 1000's of hours to do
them all, i guess.)

Do we have a place to collect the completions of GNU commands?
That would be cool, I am quite sure.
