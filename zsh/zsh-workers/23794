That's never been properly handled, I don't think, but in 4.2 it didn't
cause a segfault, simply assigned a duff number in the parameter suffix
table.  The code implies that could do dire things later on, but I don't
know if it did.  Now we actually use the invalid value for creating a
prefix string to analyse, which causes the crash.  I think the immediate
fix is simply "don't do that".  I don't think parameter completion should
even be active in this case, but there's no way I'm going down that route.
This parq business is in the "not even obscure" category.
