It says $((x)) is meant to be the same as $(($x)) which I
understand as any occurrance of a variable name (other than $-,
$?, $0... obviously) in $((...)) should be the same as if the $
was not ommited (when $x contains an integer constant).

That's a recent addition to the text. Only recent versions of
ash (BSD shs) support that for instance, which is why it has
been recommanded for a while to write it $(($x + 1)) instead of
$((x + 1)) in POSIX scripts. And I still use x=$(($x + 1)).

For newer ashes, $((x + 1)) is now accepted and note that you do
get an error in ash if $x is not an integer constant.

But here, $a doesn't contain an integer constant, that's out of
the scope of POSIX.

[...]

No, POSIX does say that $((a ** 2)) is the same as $(($a ** 2))
because $a contains an integer constant, and that's $((-3**2)).
