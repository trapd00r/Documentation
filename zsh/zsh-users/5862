  therefile() {
      setopt localtraps localoptions noshwordsplit
      local tmp=${TMPPREFIX}HERE$$
      trap "command rm -f $tmp" EXIT
      touch $tmp		|| return
      chmod u=rwx,go-rwx $tmp	|| return
      print -r "$1" >>$tmp	|| return
      shift
      $tmp "$@"
  }

  therefile \
  '#!/usr/local/bin/perl
  print "You typed: @ARGV\n";
  ' arg1 arg2

You typed: arg1 arg2
