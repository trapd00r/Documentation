You're making this WAY more difficult than it needs to be;

    bindkey ' ' rebind-spacebar

should be quite sufficient.

You can't rename a single widget to multiple things, so if you use
"zle -N self-insert space-key-press" then you cannot also use
"zle -N self-insert ordinary-key-press".

Generally speaking you use "zle -N" when you want to replace the behavior
of a widget no matter what key is used to invoke it, and you use bindkey
when you want to change the behavior of a specific key.
