Approximately speaking...

.zshenv

.zshrc

Actually, the division isn't that simple.  .zshenv should set up your
normal shell environment, including many options, most functions and
most variables.  .zshrc should set up your interactive shell environment,
including many options, all bindkeys and compctls, aliases, and functions
and variables that are only used interactively (such as compctl functions
and $HISTCHARS).  .zprofile (or .zlogin if you prefer) should contain
commands to run when you log in, and should not affect the environment
at all.
