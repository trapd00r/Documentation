} Looks fine to me.  Are you going to handle 4.0.2?  It probably stands a
} better chance of working.

Er, um ... I'll go ahead and commit this stuff, and I'm happy to keep
track of which patches ought to be in there, but for this one at least
I'd prefer it if you do the actual distribution file releases.  My
schedule is a bit convoluted the next several weeks.

We can talk about it again when (I won't say "if") 4.0.3 approaches.  OK?
