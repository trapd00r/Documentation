 Thanks a lot Peter! With your hint it does indeed work as [I] expected.

 Your patch in the other message indeed makes it much more clear, thanks.

 It does work if I do

	zstyle ':completion:all-matches:*' tag-order ...

but I still don't know how to limit this for cvs completion only as using
the context of ':completion:all-matches:cvs-commit:*' doesn't work. I
wonder if _complete_help can somehow be used to show the context for
another completer?

 Anyhow, for now I'm quite happy with setting the tag-order globally and
it's very nice to have this available. Thanks once again for your help and
the manual update (and thanks to Bart for explaining why was I getting 2
completion prompts, this was quite mysterious to me so I'm glad to know the
reason now)!
