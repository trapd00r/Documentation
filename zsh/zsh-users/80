The first one sets da to be a single string, and then passes it, as a
single argument, to date.  The second one passes three separate
strings.  A possible method that would work is

da=(--date '1 September' +'%A') ; date $da

which makes da an array of three strings, and passes it, as three
arguments, to date.  Another possibility is

 
da="--date '1 September' +'%A'" ; eval date $da

which I think is closer to what you were trying to do.  It makes da a
string as you did, then expands it on the eval command line.  eval
reparses its arguments, interpreting the single quotes embedded in da.
