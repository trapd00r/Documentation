:Yes, I agree. Richard should take a bow here ;-).
	
I seem to remember there was a problem with some of the stat() and associated
stuff.  Mainly because POSIX doesn't support all the S_I*() stuff used.
There would need to be a large rewrite of one part of code to make it fully
POSIX compatible.  One really big drawback with POSIX compatibility is its
lack of support for things like symbolic-links, sockets, etc.
