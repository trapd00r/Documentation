[ I thought I sent this before, but perhaps not]

I am looking for a way to automatically save the history file after  
every X number of commands entered (say 50), not based on time  
(like periodic).

Someone showed me how to do this once before but it has since been  
eaten by the little gremlin living near my hard drive.... It's a bad  
neighborhood.
