    AFAIK, dialog won't be able to do the processing, so I will end up
doing an script using sed, grep or awk to do the processing and
dialog (is not called cdialog nowadays?) for the user to choose the
options and run a program on them. I prefer to do all of it in an
script, although dialog will do the option-choosing part easily.

    Thanks for pointing, anyway :)
