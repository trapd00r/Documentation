Some systems open additional file descriptors in that area for their own
purposes: some versions of Solaris, for example.  zsh keeps explicitly
opened private file descriptors at 10 or above, but there may be things
it doesn't no about.

If you have it, lsof should give you some clue what the file descriptor
is for.

Maybe you know, but the latest shell allows

% exec {fd}<somefile
% echo $fd
