I knew that the answer had to be simple ;), i just was to sleepy yesterday
to think of this solution ;)).

I see...

I think they're are took literally. If a type 'grep something $FOO/^*txt' or
the solution you gave me above, the filenames are generated when Tab is
pressed, but not in the case of the braces, it seems they're are ignored
after the ^ operator.

It works great ;), thanks for your help.
