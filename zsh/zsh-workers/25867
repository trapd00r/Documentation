Thanks for your work.

I have checkouted the latest source code from cvs head. I can see $~tmp1
expansion works correctly, but '()Ą'/[TAB] completion still not works.

  % mkdir '()Ą'
  % touch '()Ą'/foo
  % ls '()Ą'/[TAB]
    => Nothing completes.
  % tmp1='\(\)Ą/*'
  % print $~tmp1
  ()Ą/foo

Additionally, Ą/[TAB] completion doesn't work on cvs head. (It was working on
zsh 4.3.6)

  % mkdir Ą
  % touch Ą/foo
  % ls Ą/[TAB]
   => Nothing completes.


Replacing _path_files with previous one (zsh 4.3.6) seems to solve the problem.
I'm not sure, but it might be a regression in _path_files.
