me too.

Good News!  I was using an old _path_files and this now works.

Bad News!  Trying to get correction after a ~ now seems to fail.  For
example, ~/bin/comp/set<TAB> should offer me _set or _setopt, but doesn't.
Using $HOME instead of ~ doesn't help.  An explicit path, or
bin/comp/set<TAB> in my home directory, work as expected.
