Subject: lost a couple colors

When I switched over to using zsh, I seemed to
have lost a couple colors in my ls. I've lost
bold cyan and bold red. Here are the lines
from my /etc/DIR_COLORS.

LINK 01;36      # symbolic link
.tar 01;31      # archives or compressed (bright red)
.tgz 01;31

If someone could point out why I lost these
two colors, I'd appreciate it. Thanks.
