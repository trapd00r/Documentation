Hm, I admit that I never tried this in zsh... In fact, it works
like this in zsh, but exactly the OTHER way round in ksh. In ksh
3<&p means "duplicate the coproc input to unit 3". IMHO this is
more consistent and intuitive than what zsh does.

After looking into the doc, I even suspect that this may be a bug...
Quoting from chapter 6, "redirection":

  <&p
  >&p   The input/output from/to the coprocess is moved to the 
        standard input/output.

If 'input' corresponds to <&p, this is fact what ksh does and what 
zsh DOESN'T!

Regards,
    Bernd
