} ... it was running everything in the /etc/z* files. In the past, these
} were always ignored unless you used one of the configure options such as
} --enable-etcdir yet they seem to always be being read now.

It's been the default to read the global RC files unless --disable-etcdir
(or --disable-zshenv, etc., for individual files) since at least July 1996,

There haven't been any changes to this part of configure.in since at least
zsh-3.1.4, except for one typographical error fixed by zsh-workers/6477
back in June of 1999.
