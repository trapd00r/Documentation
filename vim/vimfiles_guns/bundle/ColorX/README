This script lets you insert hex or RGB color codes directly into the buffer by using OS X's color picker. This can for example be useful for web developers who are editing their CSS files with Vim on OS X or similar tasks. Furthermore, when the cursor is over a hex color code like #ffffff, this is set as the starting color for the color picker.

:ColorHEX or :ColorRGB will bring up the color picker. After a color has been selected the hex or RGB values will be inserted at the current position in the buffer.
