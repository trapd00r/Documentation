I'm aware of the following things that need fixing, not including
problems we aren't currently able to debug directly (crashes and hangs
on certain systems).  They are all problems that show up particularly
when dealing with non-ASCII characters, but the last two aren't actually
specific to that:

- Finish making padding multibyte-aware: it's not done for printf nor
for padding using typeset flags.
- The matcher specifications in completion don't handle multibyte
characters and are currently written in such a way as to make this
hard (similar to the old suffix character handling).
- $' quoting is badly handled in completion.
- More untokenization is needed; certainly in parameter substitution and
quite possibly in random other places including completion.

No doubt more will show up.  This isn't going to be quick to get right.
