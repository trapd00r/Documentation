I don't think it would matter too much if they were on the empty side
while we are still on version 3.1.x.

Linking User to the directory probably wouldn't be the best approach
because there are many commands for which the completion won't be system
specific. I would go for an approach similar to that for installing
modules so users can add directories to install to a file listing the
completion directories. The configure script could possibly be enhanced
to intelligently add any appropriate directories. I would also subdivide
the User directory a little. For example if all the X programs were in
their own directory then they could be excluded on a system which lacks
X. We might later add directories for obscure software which would only
be relevant to a small number of users. This is a large reason why I
prefer the directories to be preserved with the installation (via
--enable-function-subdirs) and think it should be the default.

I don't use rpm or cvs either so I won't volunteer for those but there
are many other programs for which I plan to write completions - I had an
enormous number of tcsh completes which I have yet to convert to zsh.
I've got a few IRIX/AIX specific ones which I'll contribute if and when
we have directories set up to accomodate them.

A programming style guide would certainly be a good idea and its
usefulness would not be limited to writing zsh completions. It might be
a good idea to start one off as a simple text file, listing key points
particularly any which aren't immediately obvious like the compadd
point. We can always convert it to LaTeX/yodl/texinfo/whatever and
expand it into a readable document later.
