make install calls make install.modules, which has various problems (it looks
like MODULE is misspelled MONULE, but I don't know if that's intentional or
not.) - it does a "for dir in $(MODULE_DIRS); do", but that variable is empty,
and so sh gets pouty.

I'd suggest either removing install.modules from the make install line, or else
putting it at the end of the install: line.
