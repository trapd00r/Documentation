Hi
Somebody wrote me a script to copy the newest file in a distant directory to 
the current directory, unfortunately I can't find it, (it was at least a year 
ago)

eg
> copy_newest_file_in_dir   /path/to/dir/

BTW the archive search at 
http://www.zsh.org/cgi-bin/mla/wilma/users
doesnt seem to be working
