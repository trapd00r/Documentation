Essentially, yes.

It's actually a bit worse in a shell-like interpreted language with
loose syntax.  If a C #define is missing, your program probably won't
compile.  If a global alias doesn't get defined, your script runs anyway,
you pass an extra (or at least different) argument to some command, and
who knows what happens from there.
