Subject: PATCH: icomplete keys in compsys.yo


Dunno if we should do this (since i-c-w isn't really part of the
completion system).

+item(tt(incremental_prompt))(
+The keys with the prefix tt(incremental_) are used by the

+This key defines the Prompt to show in the status line during
+incremental completion. The sequence `tt(%u)' is replaced by the
+unambiguous part of all matches if there is any and it is different
+from the word on the line. A `tt(%s)' is replaced with `tt(-no
+match-)', `tt(-no prefix-)', or an empty string if there is no
+completion matching the word on the line, if the matches have no
+common prefix different from the word on the line or if there is such
+a common prefix, respectively. The sequence `tt(%c)' is replaced by
+the name of the completer function that generated the matches (without
+the leading underscore). Finally, `tt(%n)' is replaced by the number
+of matches generated and `tt(%a)' is replaced by an empty string if
+the matches are in the normal set (i.e. the one without file names
+with one of the suffixes from the tt(fignore) array) and with `tt(
+-alt-)' if the matches are in the alternate set.
