This indicates that it's reading your .zlogout file.  Anything there
that could account for the behavior?

This ...

}                                     2 exalias
}                                       1 exalias
}                                       1 gethashnode
}                                         1 gethashnode

... makes me suspect you've got a recursively-expanding alias involved,
but that's much less certain than that it's .zlogout related.
