Geoff Wing <mason@primenet.com.au> typed:
:% touch 101 111 121
:% ls <10-12>1
:ls: <10-12>1: No such file or directory
:Now, it's obvious why it's failing, since 101, 111 & 121 don't match the
:10 to 12 range.  My opinion is that it probably shouldn't fail in this case,
:but maybe a different operator or option/modifier should be used to get it
:to match. since there may be cases where someone wants to match on, say,
:``<1-50>foo'' and not get, say, ``100foo'' matching.

 ``<1-50>*oo'' and ``100foo'' might be better examples.
