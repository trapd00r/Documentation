Have you tried the _match completer? If you don't want the entire array
displayed, what do you want displayed?

The _prefix completer is probably what you want then. It ignores the
suffix. It seems to work in the same way as bash to me. So try:
    zstyle ':completion:*::::' completer _match _prefix _complete
making sure you leave the completeinword option set.
