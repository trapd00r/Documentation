I alwys put one of the following comments at the top of my startup
scripts so I remember what goes where, and in what order:

# .zprofile -- loaded if login shell        .zshenv .zprofile .zshrc .zlogin
# .zshenv -- always loaded                  .zshenv .zprofile .zshrc .zlogin
# .zshrc -- loaded if interactive shell     .zshenv .zprofile .zshrc .zlogin

The comments at at the top of the example scripts also have good
descriptions of what should go into what script.
