hrmm... i can't seem to get this to work?  i have this:
aura% echo $WORDCHARS
*?_-.[]~=/&;!#$%^(){}<>

if i type:
aura% cd /usr/home/william/

and hit ^W (which is bound to backward-kill-word but i've also tried
doing:
bindkey '^W' backward-delete-word)

it wipes to the beginning of /usr/home....

however it does let me delete to certain characters like the @ sign
(which _isn't_ mentioned in that list).

for instance:
% dig @ns.newdream.net
turns to:
% dig @

if i hit ^W.

this is what i want, however i would also like to be able to do what the
original poster was asking.  so is there a different variable i need to
set or am i missing something obvious here?

TIA

will
