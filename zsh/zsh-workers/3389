} Yes, but I still don't get it.  ^^ should prevent expansion, shouldn't it.

It prevents rc_expand_param.  It doesn't prevent array expansion.  That
is, it prevents (x y) from being combined with the rest of the string in
every possible combination; it doesn't make (x y) into a string istead of
into an array.  You need quoting for that.

So either 1a1x 1ay 1b1x 1by is right, or else it should be 1a1x 1b1x y.
