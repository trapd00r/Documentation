By "typing", you mean this is on your keyboard?  Presumably the obvious
things like the locale are set correctly.

Can you reproduce this starting from "zsh -f"?

Could you send a transcript of your session (as simple as possible) made
with "script" so we can see what is being sent to the shell input?

(The same goes with anyone who is having problems with the MAC.)

Thanks.
