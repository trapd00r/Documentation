Someone suggested that I use 'fc' and precmd to call a function to  
backup my zhistory file.

However, I cannot figure out how to do this (I keep ending up with  
a size=0 file).

What I want to do:

backup the _last_50 commands I have entered (otherwise it gets very  
slow waiting for the entire history file to be backed up, and once  
I have it, I'd rather just add to it than start all over each 50  
commands).

Thanks

TjL
