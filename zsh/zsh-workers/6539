And it looks like we'd better do something with options, too.  There is the
code from compinstall, but then there's always the possibility we could
make it a function as Andrej keeps suggesting.  compinstall could still
work out the path to the completion functions and make it get passed down
to compinit, and if compdump was also a function it wouldn't need searching
for, which removes one headache.

It's hard to know where to put it that isn't going to confuse matters,
either because someone has code to search for `undefined', or because the
next word is taken as the function name, etc.  Maybe as long as `functions
-uU' works OK it's good enough.
