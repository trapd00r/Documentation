Hi,
I was writing a string parsing shell script, which now and again broke. Turned out that some of the
strings were getting double quoted eg """fred""", (because I wasn't filtering properly), any way the
shell error message didn't/couldn't show this I was doing a cd "somestring" it just said 

chdir:9: no such file or directory: /c/inetpub/wwwdev/de...

I presume the error message manages quotes in it's own way. Anyway it was a piglet to debug. Just
thought I'd let others know of this kind of trap
