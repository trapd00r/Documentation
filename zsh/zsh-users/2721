How do I enable case-insensitive completion again?  I'm sure I used to
have it, once, but I don't seem to get it now.  

For example, in a directory containing only the file README, I'd want
"vi read<TAB>" to complete to "vi README".  But it doesn't.

Actually, maybe I'm confusing it with approximate matching, which
often feels similar.  (i.e., "vi Rea<TAB>" does expand to "vi README",
so possibly I'm just confused.)
