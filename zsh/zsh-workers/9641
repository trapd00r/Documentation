[snip various problems with global zsh{env,rc} in Mandrake and RedHat
rpms]

Just thought I'd mention that I've modified the relevant files in my
automated nightly built RPMs according to Bart's criticisms, since
they were also derived from the problematic RedHat originals.  Hope
they're approaching "correctness" now.  I also even fixed the nightly
build process so that it actually works now :-)

In case anyone's still interested (surprisingly, a few people have
been in the past), they're still at:
