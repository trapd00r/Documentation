Any comments on this?  Should I install the patch, giving the documented
behaviour?  Or should I fix the documentation to say that IGNOREEOF ignores
an arbitrary number of EOFs in zle?  Or does anyone think zle is supposed
to handle this internally, requiring a bigger fix?

I'm inclined to think the first option is the safest, unless anyone
remembers what's going on.
