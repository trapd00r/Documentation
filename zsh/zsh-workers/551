When I try to compile zsh with gcc (the default from the configure command), I
get the following error:

gcc -c -I.. -I. -I.  -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -Wall -Wno-implicit -Wmissing-prototypes -fwritable-strings -O2 zle_tricky.c
zle_tricky.c: In function `maketildelist':
zle_tricky.c:1637: incompatible type for argument 3 of `yp_all'

It compiles fine with the normal CC compiler:

cc -Olimit 2000 -O2 -I. -I.. -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -c zle_tricky.c

works without any errors.

This was with gcc 2.7.0 for zsh-beta11, but I know the error has been in there
since at least beta 8 or so, with gcc 2.6.3.  This is for a DEC alpha running
OSF/1 3.2 (but I had the same problem a while ago on OSF/1 3.0).

Thanks for all the work with zsh--it's a great shell!
