    Hi Bart :)

    So it's not a side effect nor a bug, it's a feature...

    This is what I always get, BTW, if I hit <Tab> to expand the
variable assignment, no matter the status of rcexpandparam. This was
confusing me even more.

    My problem was that I wasn't associating rcexpandparam with the
rc shell in any way O:) All is clear now, thanks a lot :)))
