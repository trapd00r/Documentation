} 
} weird.... (FreeBSD 6.2-RELEASE amd64) it sometimes works under bash, 
} doesn't work under zsh. see below. similar results in a 7.1-STABLE jail, 
} but it seems more likely to work as desired.

Oh, there's probably a race condition then.  Try this instead:

  perl -e '$0 = "Test hiding command"; sleep 10;' & sleep 2; ps $!

The extra sleep in the parent shell will give perl a bit longer to get
going.

Your evidence so far indicates that assigning to $0 in perl is able
to change the command, so there must be something perl is doing that
"jobs -Z" is not doing.
