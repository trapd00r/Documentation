That's a trick question, right?! To be able to log diectly into a
shell you have to make that shell your, your, your /login shell/,
right.

What do you have to do to make a shell your login shell? That's Uniz
101 so I won't tell you that but just try 'apropos "login shell"' and
the command should be the first returned.

By the way: zsh 3.1.6 is ridiciously outdated...
