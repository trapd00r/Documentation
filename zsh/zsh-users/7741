That does have the consequence of not telling you when you actually
mistype a local match pattern.  I prefer to leave nomatch set and to
manually quote wildcards that need to be expanded remotely.  You'd
either use quotes or a backslash, like this:

$ scp someserver:tmp/\*.txt .

(Note that the leading "~/" isn't needed since ssh defaults to being in
your home directory.)  Just my 2 cents.
