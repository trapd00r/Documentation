} autoconf doesn't support this. [...] autoconf seems to be deliberately
} set up to make it hard to tweak features as opposed to turn them on or
} off, goodness knows why.

Excerpt from "info autoconf":
-----------------------------
     --enable-FEATURE[=ARG]
     --disable-FEATURE

   These options allow users to choose which optional features to build
and install.  `--enable-FEATURE' options should never make a feature
behave differently or cause one feature to replace another.  They
should only cause parts of the program to be built rather than left out.
-----------------------------

In autoconf terminology, every module is its own FEATURE, and you are
supposed to have to turn each one on or off with a separate option.

This is undoubtedly an RMS-ism; one look at the section titles in the
"History" chapter of the autoconf info should give some idea of the
futility of further explanation.
