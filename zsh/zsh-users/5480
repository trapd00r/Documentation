I got a reply from Karsten at Sunsite Denmark. He wrote:

Anyone know what `TMDA' stands for? Or `LISA' for that matter?

I've confirmed that the auc.dk alternative now bounces which it does so
remember that you can't use it any more. That'll cut out more than half
the spam.

I'd be in favour of some sort of automated spam filtering such as
spamassassin with the rejected messages going to some address which a
human can periodically check through and resend any false positives on
from. I can do that unless somebody else is happy to.

Are other people blocking yahoo? If so I'll post under a different
address.
