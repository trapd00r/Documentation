There are a couple of differences, one of which is that tcsh doesn't
terminate with a null, only seperates with them.  Another is the you
need to unset nullglob, so a function seems best to me.
Anyway, I had a spare couple of minutes and was just playing.  I'm sure 
there are several possible improvements in them.
