The answer to the question you've just asked is `(#e) with the
extendedglob option set'.  However, this doesn't get you very far here.
The answer to the question you should have asked is one of the
following:

  files=(/var/tmp/exec.<->)

or if you're really attached to [[:digit:]]:

  setopt extendedglob
  files=(/var/tmp/exec.[[:digit:]]##)
