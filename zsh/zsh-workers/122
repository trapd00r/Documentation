I agree this is a little inconsistent.  What about `foo=(*)', though?
I use that kind of thing a lot, and it seems obvious to me that it
should always do globbing --- at least, I tend to think of arguments
of an array assignment behaving like command line arguments as far as
word splitting is concerned.  Perhaps it's not obvious to others.  (I
can do `set -A' but I like assignments to look like assignments.)

I think they've now disappeared, though I don't know when that
happened:  certainly some pretty grotesque constructions now do the
same in zsh as the other shells.  I meant to delete this line.
