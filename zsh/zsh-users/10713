Subject: Problem Inoking gdb
X-Mailer: MH-E 8.0.2; GNU Mailutils 1.0.1; GNU Emacs 22.0.50


I am having the following problem trying to invoke gdb on a processing running in a different display.

--------------------------------
 $ gdb emacs 2584
GNU gdb 6.5.50.20060706-cvs (cygwin-special)
Copyright (C) 2006 Free Software Foundation, Inc.........
...............
Attaching to program `/bin/emacs.exe', process 2584

zsh: suspended (tty output)  gdb emacs 2584
--------------------------------

So the zsh running gdb is suspended and the gdb process is also suspended and must be manually "killed".

I was wondering if any of you have had a similiar problem or any ideas for a solution.

Thanks,
  Darel Henman
