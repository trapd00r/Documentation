This sounds very interesting, but it looks like your implementation
could be a bit more zsh-ish.  No reason to process-substitute with
dirname and basename when zsh can do that stuff itself!

	local DIR="$1:h"
	local STRIP="$1:r"
	local EXT="$1:e"

	if [[ "$EXT" == .(gz|bz2) && "$STRIP" == *.tar ]]; then
	    STRIP="$STRIP:r"
	    EXT=".tar$EXT"
	fi
	if [[ -d "$1" ]]; then
	    builtin cd "$1"
	elif [[ "$EXT" == .(tar.(gz|bz2)|tgz|zip|TGZ|ZIP) &&
		-d "$STRIP" ]]; then
	    builtin cd "$STRIP"
	elif [[ -f "$1" ]]; then
	    builtin cd "$DIR"
	else
	    builtin cd "$1"
	fi
