Actually it appears that it doesn't.  It's been a while since I read
this area of the standard, but as I had specifically looked up this
issue I thought I had remembered it correctly.  I think it would be
nice to implement this kind of field splitting anyway (predicated on
SH_WORD_SPLIT, and have POSIX_FIELD_SPLIT to get POSIX behaviour).

I think that we should have a POSIX emulation mode ("emulate posix").
It would be nice to use it by default if invoked as sh with
POSIXLY_CORRECT set in the environment.  We are going to need a couple
of options for POSIX conformance that contradict sh and ksh
compatibility.
