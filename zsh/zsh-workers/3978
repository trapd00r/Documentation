Subject: ZLE reference card
Date: Fri, 15 May 98 17:57:47 +0100

I've hacked together a first attempt at a reference card for ZLE. It's at
  http://www.ifh.de/~pws/computing/zlerefcard.tex
  http://www.ifh.de/~pws/computing/zlerefcard.ps

I haven't done any more work on the original reference card, which is
still there (omit the zle).  Before I do anything more on either,

1) how is this one for size, currently \footnotesize on a 10pt
document (probably an 8pt text font)?  I could have made it the next
one down (\scriptsize, probably 7pt), but it still needed 3 pages so
it wasn't worth it.  If this is still generous on the eyes, I may try
the main refcard at \scriptsize.

2) Is the order OK?  I've copied it straight from the manual page and
the rule seems to be alphabetical order, but ignore any prefixes of
emacs- or vi-.  I find it a little confusing.

3) Any other suggestions, e.g. is the display of the bindings clear?
I've noticed the display of the last few entries in section 4 is a
little ragged.

4) Is anybody able to report experiences on letter format paper?
