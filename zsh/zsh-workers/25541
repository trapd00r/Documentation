Can't see how to download the latest sources for building.

Go to http://zsh.sourceforge.net/
Note the 'Download' heading.
  -> Hmm. must be either under Contents or Mirrors.
Click on Contents
  -> Here I see only filenames, not complete URLs. Gotta make one up.
Try http://zsh.sourceforge.net/zsh.tar.bz2
  -> Nope. gets an error page
Try http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Arc/zsh.tar.bz2
  -> Nope. gets an error page
