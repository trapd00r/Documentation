Subject: Memory errors with Fedora 9 x86_64

Having just upgraded to Fedora 9 x86_64 with kernel 2.6.25.3-18.fc9.x86_64
and gcc 4.3.0, I'm getting occasional memory errors when running the
tests with --enable-zsh-mem (which may or may not cause the test to
fail, and are apparently random).  I added the following debugging and the
memory requested doesn't seem out of the ordinary.  Is anyone else
seeing anything similar?

It's possible --enable-zsh-mem has simply had it's day.  I'm not seeing
any errors without that, but it's also possible this is a genuine system
problem.
