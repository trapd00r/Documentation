compctl is [almost] mutually incompatible with the newer completion
system that's enabled by running "compinit".  Unless you are NOT using
compsys, compctl will in most cases have no effect.

I say "almost" because there is a way to configure compsys to fall back
on compctl when it can't find any other completions, but that doesn't
help with -T (which you'd need to have kick in first rather than last).
