Agreed.  But I'm curious as to why you (Marc Baudoin) even want zsh
statically linked.  I prefer to keep root dead simple, using /bin/sh without
evan a .profile.  In an emergency, I can (almost) always login as root.  For
day to day administration, I have a second root account (uid 0 but a
different login name) which has zsh and a full set of startup files as its
login shell.

And by the way, I install zsh as /bin/zsh, dynamically linked.

What's wrong with:

        ./configure ; make ; make install
        rm Src/zsh
        make LDFLAGS='-static' ; make install bindir='/bin'

One set of object files, dynamic zsh in /usr/local/bin, static zsh in /bin,
and no changes to the zsh distribution.
