You can force the shell to use globbing characters to match the results
of completions by setting "setopt globcomplete".  Depending how completion
is set up, the shell may decided to perform expansion instead if there
are files that match.  For example, "cvs c*t<TAB>" might offer "commit"
or "checkout", but if there is a file config.txt you could get that instead.
It's possible to configure the shell not to do expansion, or alternatively
to use different keystrokes to do expansion and completion.
