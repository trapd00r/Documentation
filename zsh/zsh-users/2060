Moved from zsh-workers to zsh-users.
This is what I have in my .zshrc:

######################################################################
# emulate bash

# do not automatically list ambiguous completion
# instead, use TAB as complete-word and TAB-TAB as list-choices
# redefine KEYTIMEOUT to be shorter to facilitate this
# for some reason I need to do bindkey ^I^I twice (?)
unsetopt AUTO_LIST
KEYTIMEOUT=15
bindkey "^I^I" list-choices
bindkey "^I" expand-or-complete
bindkey "^I^I" list-choices

# do beep on ambiguous completion
setopt LIST_BEEP
