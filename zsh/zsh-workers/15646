Hi,

I think I've found a weird bug in _approximate. This reproduces it:

% zsh -f                                                                                                                            Thu 16 Aug 2001
16:51:12
% echo $ZSH_VERSION
4.0.2
% autoload -U compinit
% compinit
% zstyle ":completion:*" completer _complete _approximate
% mkdir -p ~/test/test{1,2}
% ~/test/f

Press tab immediately after the 'f', and I get:

% \!
\!      *       -       .       0       1       :       @       X       \[      e       r       test1/  test2/  w       \{      \}
~/test/f

Which wasn't quite what I expected! ;)

Cheers,

Martin.
