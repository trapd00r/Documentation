Ideally, you should fcvt(), gcvt() and ecvt(), which handle locales as well
as hiding the details of the conversion.  They are almost certainly widely
enough available to make it worth getting configure to detect them.
Unfortunately, you still need a fallback --- maybe the current set of
fudges using printf(3) is enough for that.
