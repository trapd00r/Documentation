According to the Files section of the manual, it goes

/etc/zshenv
~/.zshenv
/etc/zprofile
~/.zprofile
/etc/zshrc
~/.zshrc
/etc/zlogin
~/.zlogin

so presumably ~/.zshenv would work. however, putting

zstyle ':completion:*' users
zstyle ':completion:*' groups

in ~/.zshenv doesn't seem to help. Looking at compaudit itself, it
looks like it's still running "getent group".
