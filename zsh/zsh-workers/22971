Just to complete the story...  "jobs" on its own is simply a builtin and
doesn't cause the special logic to create a pseudojob, while in braces it
becomes a construct that gets special handling.  It's usually job 1 because that's
the first that's free; as it's special it doesn't cause %- or %+ to be set.

This is fixed by the patch that I just posted, but I noticed that the form
of error is different for no good reason, so I'll put that right, too.
