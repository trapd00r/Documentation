What I had hoped, was this to work:

zstyle ':completion:*:-tilde-:*' completer _complete _ignored _approximate
zstyle ':completion:*'           completer _expand _complete _ignored _approximate

Because the manual says:

[snip]
-tilde-
    After an initial tilde (`~'), but before the first slash in the
    word.
[snap]

And since the longer style should win against the shorter one, I would
have expected it to work. But evidently, it doesn't. What would be the
reason for that?

Regards, Frank
