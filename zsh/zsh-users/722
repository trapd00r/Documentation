Assuming you're never going to be doing command line editing with zsh
in a terminal that's `dumb', you can put

[[ $TERM = dumb ]] && unsetopt zle

in your .zshrc.  This certainly works for me.

(If you *did* need to do edit in a dumb terminal, probably the right thing
to do would be to find out what the terminal actually is anyway.)
