Greetings,

I use zsh 4.0.6 under Cygwin.  If I try to complete an absolute
path like this: ls /cygdrive/c/Prog<tab>, or a relative path that
includes a drive letter like this: cd /cygdrive/d; ls
../c/Prog<tab>, zsh seems to access the floppy drive.  That
obviously slows down the completion.  I wonder if it tries to
access all the other drives (some of which are mapped from network
on the machine in question) as well...

I have a suspicion that this might actually be a feature, since I
think I have seen zsh complete something like /foo/bar/qu<tab> to
/foo/baz/quux.  In any case, is there a way to get rid of this
behaviour?
