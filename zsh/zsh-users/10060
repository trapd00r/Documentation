} wow ! and what about syntax parsing, UI and IA in zsh ? ;)

IA?  Intelligent Agent?  Intel Architecture?  Intangible Assets?
Inscrutable Abbreviations?

Zsh *is* a UI.  It's not a *G*UI, but it's still a UI.

As for syntax parsing, you're welcome to become our resident expert

complex completion definitions but never understood by anyone else.
