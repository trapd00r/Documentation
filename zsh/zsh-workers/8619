I've always been really ambivalent about whether glob sorting ought to
be controlled by emulate, but I also always conclude that there might
be some circumstance in which someone is relying on globbing order.
However, now that I think of it, globbing order is already going to be
altered by LC_COLLATE, so scripts that rely on it are out of luck in
the first place.

Anyone care to dispute the conclusion that either NUMERIC_GLOB_SORT
should not be reset by emulate, or else LC_COLLATE should not be used
in glob sorting?  (We already removed it from character ranges.)
