Actually, for just that reason, your idea of doing it in the functions is
probably better.  The less hidden code the more I like it.

There's a nice project for someone with a bit of time.  This can probably
be done in shell functions too --- it's system-specific, so not good to
hard code, and the only place this is used internally is for supplying to
functions doing progress reports, which can be rewritten to use information
returned by ls where necessary.
