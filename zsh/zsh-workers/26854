Thanks, you're right it was /bin/sh.  The system turns out to have a
stty in /etc/profile that's really intended only for interactive shells.
The test is for login shells, so that makes sense.  Could there be a way to
work around such breakage to /etc/profile?  I can't think of anything easy.

Apparently so, this eliminates my test failure by not compiling terminfo
at all.  I'll see if I can configure it back in as well.
