I tried both of these solutions. (I assume that all I had to do was edit
the files and then ssh in to make use of the new definitions.) Neither
seemed to have any effect. Other suggestions?

In 1997 a group of programmers started writing a desktop environment
to fix a travesty they didn't create.  Their program promptly found
its way onto un*x systems everywhere. Today, still opposed by a
software monopolist, they survive as soldiers of fortune.  If you share
their vision, if you know you can help, and if you can connect to
internet, maybe you can join... the K-Team.
