I assumed it wasn't, since the code in termcap and terminfo has changed,
but actually it looks like it is.  In particulary this chunk of code:

    pm->sets.cfn = NULL;
    pm->gets.cfn = strgetfn;
    pm->sets.ifn = NULL;
    pm->gets.ifn = intgetfn;

clearly doesn't take account of the fact that sets and gets are unions.

I'll see if I can dig out the bits to copy over, since there was an
extra patch after 4.0.6.
