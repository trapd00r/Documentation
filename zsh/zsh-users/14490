Thanks for clarifying this.

I just did this:

   if [[ ! ( ($cmdnum -ge 1) && ($cmdnum -le $limit) ) ]]

Maybe I should have asked differently because there might be a better  
solution for what I'm trying to do. I have an array of commands,  
$cmds, and a user supplied $cmdnum. Now I want to check wether the  
user entered a valid number. ($limit would be $#cmds in this example).

Is there a better way to check wether the user entered a) a number and  
b) in the range 1..$#cmds?


Sebastian
