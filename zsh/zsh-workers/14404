Yes, in fact that was the case.

OK, next question ... what is a good way to delete all the environment
variables apart from 'special' ones?  Currently I have this in my .zshenv (on
Solaris)

unset `/usr/ucb/printenv | /bin/sed -e 's/=.*$//;' | egrep -v '^(PATH|HOME|HOST|LOGNAME|MACHTYPE|TERM|TZ|USER|_|PWD|DISPLAY|CLEARCASE_ROOT|SHLVL)'`

(Obviously I now need to add MANPATH to the saved list. :-))

My intention is that if I re-source .zshenv, I get the environment reset to
effectively what I would have after logging in.  Maybe just making sure all the
'special' variables like SHLVL, MANPATH etc are included would be enough, as
the method was doing what I wanted under v3.1.5.

Thanks for your help so far.
Richard
