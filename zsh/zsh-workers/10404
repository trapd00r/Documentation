Subject: A couple of bugs
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

I was trying to work out why completion for the second argument to cd
wasn't working and found what I think is a bug with the handling of
patterns of the form pat1~pat2. This bug manifests itself when the
first character of pat2 is a slash. Try this:
  echo /*~/dev
This gives me a message about no matches found. I would expect results
similar to what you see with:
  echo /*~[/]dev

The second bug is that completion after ~+ or ~- seems to have been
broken since dev-19:
  cd ~+1/<tab>
  unknown user `+1'
Here I would expect file completion after the appropriate directory
from the stack. The problem is also the case for named directories.
