This is really a good option, having a subdirectory for duplicate files to
which our make files
can point to, but any common changes must be integrated carefully.

We will be cautious in not getting the auto generated files distributed...

After integration, we must make sure that the existing behaviors on Linux is
not broken, so is there any test suite (sort of) to confirm this.?

&gt; Here are my views,<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; 1. Contributing back to the current development brach of the Zsh project.<br>
&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp; - This is just by getting our changes under a compiler switch specific<br>

&gt; works as expected for both the platforms. Symbian code structure is<br>
&gt; different from the Zsh project, hence we need to change this to align with<br>
&gt; Zsh project.<br>
&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp; - &nbsp;Any update to the Symbian specific source can only be performed by<br>
&gt; using the available Symbian SDK for Windows as we currently don&#39;t have one<br>

<br>

probably the messier part is working out where to put your non-standard<br>

<div class="Ih2E3d"><br>
&gt; 2. Contribution categorised by platform, having a separate code base for<br>
&gt; Symbian.<br>
&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp;- This is just by pushing our code with the current code structure, the<br>

<br>

&gt; 3. Zsh project advertising the source hosted in Symbian Developer Network.<br>
&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp; - This doesn&#39;t need any contribution to the Zsh project, the integration<br>
