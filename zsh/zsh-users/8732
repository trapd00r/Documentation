Hi all,

I am new to zsh. The completion works well, I use a .zshrc that I found
in a tutorial on the web.

Up to now, the only problem is with surfraw: with bash, I used to type:

% sr [TAB] 

and I was proposed the elvi list (alioth, altavista, amazon etc.) to
complete.
With zsh however, I get the files of the directory I'm in.

I found nothing in the archive or Google about that. Sorry if it is a
FAQ... I run Debian Sid, zsh 4.2.5-3, surfraw 2.1.0-1.

Any pointer will be welcome.
