something to add perhaps to myself:
i configured my zsh with:
./configure --enable-locale --enable-pcre --enable-zsh-debug --enable-zsh-mem-debug --enable-zsh-mem-warning --enable-zsh-mem

the message after the try to stop the loop was a loop
itself so i had to use screen's control-a k to kill the
window and the shell.
