======================

including comments, my zshrc is currently 430 lines, 15KB. i'm (currently) 
subscribing to the theory that it's best to have one file that i use for 
all logins on all systems, and make it adapt itself accordingly. the 
alternative is re-writing little peices for different systems and trying 
to keep them in sync.

the only thing i have doubts about is that the $OSTYPE is determined at 
compile time, not run time. there's potential for that to cause weird 
problems, but nothing that would be fixed by 
${ZDOTDIR}/.zshrc.${HOST%%.*}.
