} These:

Hmm, none of those should have an adverse effect.  Try this:

autoload -U zed
Run "zed -f _complete_debug"
Scroll down to the line that reads "_main_complete"
Replace that with "_expand_word_and_keep"
Type ctrl-x ctrl-w to save

Now, set up an expansion of the sort that fails to work as expected,
but instead of your usual expand-word binding, type ctrl-x ?
(yes, that's ctrl-x followed by a question mark).

This should produce a trace file of the commands executed by the
completion system, which you can examine to see whether "compadd -J"
is ever being called.  If you can't see what's wrong, post it somewhere
accessible (or at worst, mail it to zsh-users) so we can have a look.
Make sure it doesn't contain any sensitive data, first, of course.
