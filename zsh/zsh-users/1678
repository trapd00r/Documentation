As it is a syslog log file there is a standard way to do this:

  mv /var/adm/extlog /var/adm/extlog.`date`
  cp /dev/null /var/adm/extlog
  kill -HUP `cat /etc/syslog.pid`

syslogd will continue writing to the old log file until the
kill signal is sent to it.

Nothing is ever lost - as long as syslog is behaving itself!

Hope this helps.
