For some reason, now that I've switched from zsh 3.0.0 to 3.0.5,
issuing a "cd" command echoes back the directory I'm going to
if it isn't an absolute path:

nik> cd test
~/test
nik>

I have AUTO_PUSHD turned on, but I also have PUSHD_SILENT turned
on. Is this a bug in 3.0.5? I really hate having the extra stuff
clutter my terminal window.
