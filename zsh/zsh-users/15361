I installed chere, and it appears to work fine for me.  I tried first 
with mintty, and then had to install rxvt before testing with it (only 
had rxvt-unicode installed).

I notice that the rxvt command prepends Cygwin's 'run.exe' wrapper, 
whereas the mintty version lacks it:

rxvt: (as you listed):
C:\cygwin\bin\run.exe C:\cygwin\bin\rxvt.exe -e /bin/xhere /bin/zsh.exe "%L"

mintty:
C:\cygwin\bin\mintty.exe -e /bin/xhere /bin/zsh.exe "%L"

Maybe try dropping that?:
C:\cygwin\bin\rxvt.exe -e /bin/xhere /bin/zsh.exe "%L"

(It still works either way for me, but that's just one more variable to 
eliminate.)

Windows 7 Home Premium Ver 6.1 Build 7600

(not sure what else is relevant -- suspect that's enough)
