Try using:

for ((i=0;i<=10;i++)) do echo "$i\n"; done

See the section on Arithmetic Evaluation in the manual. Anything inside
(( ... )) is dealt with as a math expression so you use != == <= >= for
comparisons and = (and others like +=) for assignment. There is a full
list in the manual. You would use things like -eq and -le in a Condition
Expression (which is the following section of the manual). These are
introduced with [[ ... ]] and are more useful when doing operations on
strings, filenames etc.
