Subject: PATCH: 3.0.6-* / 3.1.6-* : Make intro.ms work with groff
MIME-Version: 1.0

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

I'm not even sure this was worth the time I spent on it, given how wildly
out of date this document is, but having done it I might as well send out
the patch.  It took an amazingly long time to piece together these eight
lines of incantation from several different bits of documentation; I'd not
have succeeded without ORA's UNIX in a Nutshell for System V (which doesn't
have any groff doc, but supplied the troff command list that the FSF so
helpfully assumes everyone already knows).
