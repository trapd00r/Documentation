What Perl has done, and what Sun has done for its Python distribution as
well, is to introduce a vendor-packages (for Python; vendor_perl for perl)
directory which is for packaged modules which can thus conflict with
neither the core modules nor with anything installed by hand.  That's one
way past this particular objection.  I agree that for packaged functions,
though, a place under /usr is more appropriate than under /etc.
