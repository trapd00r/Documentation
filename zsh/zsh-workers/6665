Subject: _match and auto menu with multipath again

As I can recall, _match automatically starts menu completion (if more than one
choice is present). I won't argue that (after all, there is no place where I can
type in next char :-), but I still find the current way pretty confusing:

bor@itsrm2:~%> compconf -L
compconf correct_accept='2n'
compconf match_original='yes'
compconf completer='_complete:_match'
compconf dumpfile='/home/bor/.zcompdump'
compconf correct_prompt='correct to:'
bor@itsrm2:~%> l /a/p/u/z/z*22*<TAB>
bor@itsrm2:~%> l /archive/pub/unix/zip/z*22*
zip/  zsh/

Note again, that menu is started for some middle path - without *any* visible
feedback for user (that is, I have no idea what is being completed). Even worse,
repeatedly typing TAB cycles through ``zip'' and ``zsh'', leaving no way to
select one (yes, I know - 'cursor-left,cursor-right' etc, but they are not
*natural* way). This switch to menu is very unexpected and will confuse many
users.

That was mostly a reason, why I requested cursor be placed on a word part that
is being completed. How hard is it to simply start normal completion? What I
mean, is:

bor@itsrm2:~%> l /a/p/u/z/z*22*<TAB>
bor@itsrm2:~%> l /archive/pub/unix/z/z*22*
zip/ zsh/                           ^ cursor here
and after this part is done, simply start normal completion for the next
ambiguous part?

I don't insist on it being default, but as an option?
