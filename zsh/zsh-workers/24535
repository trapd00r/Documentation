Hi all,

I am getting a weird display corruption problem, it looks like this :

[/packages/python2.5]> cd ..
c%

Notice the c and % sign. This seems to happen if I press CTRL-C too fast for 
example before the shell fully displays the command line. Asking in #zsh at 
least one other person experienced the same problem.

It might be related to my PS1 which is :

export PS1="%{$fg[green]%}[%n@%m]%{$reset_color$fg[white]%}[%D{%H:%M:
%S}]%{$reset_color%}%{$fg_bold[blue]%}
[%~]>%{$reset_color%} "

Any ideas appreciated.

Regards,
ismail
