You need to use the fake style.  Something like

zstyle ':completion:*:files' fake /var/autofs/nfs:stuff

except you have to work out what to put for `stuff'.  The manual page
implies you can put more than one name there but doesn't say how to do it.
A couple of weeks ago somebody posted a trick for how to make completion
use anything you type at this point.  Search for zstyle and fake.
