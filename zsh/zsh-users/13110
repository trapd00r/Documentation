It's certainly wrong and should be done in /etc/zprofile.
Please read "5.1 Startup/Shutdown Files".

zshrc file is used for _interactive_ login, so it contains functions,
aliases and terminal options (like key bindings, shell options and PS*,
which in fact are shell functions).
zprofile file is used for _login_ shell (e.g. xterm -ls, zsh -l or -zsh)
and so it contains environment settings.
