I've just tried ksh93, and it seems to ignore LC_COLLATE in this case,
whereas zsh uses LC_COLLATE.  

I think there's a strong case for changing zsh's behaviour here.
Although I can see why one might want to treat accented letters and
similar things in a locale specific way, ignoring case strikes me as
far worse than doing the wrong thing with accented letters.
