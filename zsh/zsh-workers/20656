There were some concerns with locale-specific collation order in the
past with respect to surprise data loss when globbing.

http://www.zsh.org/mla/users/1998/msg00740.html

http://www.zsh.org/mla/workers/1999/msg02226.html

However, the real issue with your sorting problem seems to be the use of
a comparison function that ignores locale and behaves differently
depending on the setting of the NUMERIC_GLOB_SORT option.

I think we could change the character comparison at the end of
setbpcmp() to a strcoll(), or do setxfrm()'s at the beginning.
