I've put a patch with the diffs from zsh-3.0.0 and my current working copy
to ftp://ftp.cs.elte.hu/pub/zsh/testing/zsh-3.0.1-test.diff.gz

It will also propagate to the mirror sites since the testing directory is
world-readable.

I plan to release zsh-3.0.1 sometime next week.

The file date and size is:

    18543 Sep  3 22:45 zsh-3.0.1-test.diff.gz

There are some bugfixes and ksh compatibility improvements in the patch.

Zoltan
