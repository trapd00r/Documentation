I have a question about zsh completion.  It does just about everything 
exactly the way I want it to after setting up the various configuration 
switches.

There is one problem I don't know how to solve.  When I run the java 
command, zsh will not do completion on arguments following a classpath 
flag (for example, java -classpath . abc/def/ClassFileName).  Can this 
be fixed with a configuration flag?

Thanks in advance,
