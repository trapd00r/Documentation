If I may emerge from lurk mode for a moment wearing my version purist
hat, I'd strongly suggest calling 4.0.2.  There's no shame in
incrementing the version number.  There's a little bit of shame in
being inconsistent with the version number.  There's a lot of shame in
calling two different things the by same name.  There.  Now I can go
back into lurk mode.
