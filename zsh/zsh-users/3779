Nope, none of my accounts have 'bindkey -e' and neither
do any of my /etc/zsh* files.

I did this on all of my accounts and I do not see any
references to 'bindkey' in there.

I'm going to assume that for some reason zsh is
being wacky and so I'll just set 'bindkey -e' manually
for the account that's acting up.
