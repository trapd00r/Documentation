I have to agree.  NO_HUP should not be on by default.  Too many of
my users log out and expect their apps to be killed for them.  But
the other options seem ok.

Also, Zoltan, I noticed you named the new beta as just zsh-3.1.0.
You should probably call it something like zsh-3.1-beta1, or put
it in a testing subdirectory.  I expect plenty of people will not
realize it's a beta version.  Many people will not see that it's
symlink'ed to zsh-beta and install it as a production version.
(We all know there are plenty of incompetent sysadmins out there).
