I just checked my patches and now I know why Tanaka's zle.mdd was
doubled. In my patch this was a diff from my zle.mdd to an empty
file. I have no idea how this happened because I had copied the whole
stuff with *.([ch]|mdd).

So, it's my fault (you may already have guessed that). Sorry.

Bye
 Sven
