Yep, you guessed right. http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/bash/bash-3.2.tar.gz has
the following in bash-3.2/builtins/ulimit.def:

static RESOURCE_LIMITS limits[] = {
#ifdef RLIMIT_CORE
  { 'c',        RLIMIT_CORE,  1024,     "core file size",      
"blocks" },
#endif

Should I report a bug against bash or has zsh to follow bash's example?
I quickly check standards at

http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/000095399/functions/setrlimit.html

and it says

RLIMIT_CORE
    This is the maximum size of a core file, in bytes, that may be
created by a process.

Thanks.
