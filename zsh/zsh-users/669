Yes.  I should have mentioned this change, sorry.  Now the emulation
mode is determined after examining the first letter of the name used
to invoke zsh.  If the first letter is s or b zsh enters sh emulation
mode..  Perhaps p should be added to this list (some systems use psh
for POSIX shell).

If the first letter is k, ksh emulation is turen on.

If the first letter is c, csh emulation options are used, otherwise it
uses native mode.
