Hi,

A new git mirror of zsh CVS repository is available at 
http://git.pardus.org.tr/?p=zsh to clone use ;

git clone git://git.pardus.org.tr/zsh

I know there is another git mirror at debian.org but I wanted to play with 
git-cvsimport and provide better update intervals (synced with CVS every 10 
minutes).

I hope it will be useful for you too.

Regards,
ismail
