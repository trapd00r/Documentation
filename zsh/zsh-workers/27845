I'd still rather see some checking than none at all.  (MERGE_HEAD isn't 
often applicable, for example.)

In the context I was using to test:

$ git log <Tab>

It appears to be completing both tags and branches, and it already forks 
git once to find each of those (@lines 3117 and 3140).  Four more forks 
(the version calling rev-parse on each name) might be excessive, but one 
doesn't seem so bad (the version calling it once to get --git-dir) for 
the added filtering.

rev-parse each: 100% correct, only much slower on Win32 (~.5s)
rev-parse dir + glob: mostly correct, a-bit-slower on Win32 (~.125s)
always-complete: usually wrong, no slower

Really, I feel like the forking cost would prohibit _git from being 
useful on Win32 in the first place, so it seems an odd metric to use.

(Are there other systems where the fork is expensive?  AFAIK, anything 
Unix-like shouldn't incur too much cost for it, which leaves Win32 and 
...?)
