hi,

When I say zsh uses vi mode for command line editing, does it actually
use the vi editor or does it have a vi emulation inbuilt? if it calls
the vi editor for command line editing, can i make it call vim instead?

also in vi mode, how can I open the command line in vi (like 'v' command in
ksh)?

Thanks in advance,
Raju
