Ah, i guess, i thought, that ZLS_COLOURS had to have
all the entries for the new color completion to be avaiable.
That was my mistake. Okay, until yesterday i was a
3.1.6 user so i have to get used to many new things now that 
i have the 3.1.9.
So it is no design-error. It's just my difficulty to learn 
more in less time :)

Sorry for that!

Matthias, a very happy ZSH-user just lost in the world of
information.
