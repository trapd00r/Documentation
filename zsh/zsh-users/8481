The only way is to not put it as the first character in the search
string -- i.e. to search for the character prior to the "^" as well as
the "^" itself.  Yeah, that means that there is no way to search for
just a "^" in zsh's current code.  In the future it might be nice to
upgrade the incremental search to a regex-understanding search like vim
uses (it treats invalid regex elements as literal strings, so you can
eaily search for something like "[" or "$" without having to backslash
it).
