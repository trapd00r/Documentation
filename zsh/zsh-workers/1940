Unfortunately I do not have access to DEC Unix 4.x so I cannot write such a
test without some help.  The simplest solution would be a test for some
predefined macro so that these prototypes are only defined for older DEC
Unix versions.  The list of predefined macros can be determined using
/path-to-gcc-lib/cpp -dM /dev/null

Yes, because pre6 is still not the final production release (although it is
close to it).  In zsh-3.0 I'll remove -DDEBUG which will produce a slightly
smaller and faster executable.
