These are the article numbers in the zsh-workers maining list.  To retrieve an
article send a message to zsh-workers-request@math.gatech.edu with archive as
the subject.  The message should contain something like

get latest/373

An other note: please get your site administrator configure the elm program
you use.  Your message came with this header:

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=none
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

My elm thinks that this message needs metamail processing.  I tried to add
none to compatcharsets but this did not help.

Cheers,
  Zoltan
