} You can also push-input from inside vared which doesn't do anything
} useful, maybe that should just be inhibited?

Although it's true that push-input aborts the current vared, you can
still use the pushed input with get-line, even in a subsequent call to
vared.  (push-line-or-edit is a bit *less* useful because it performs
the get-line for you.)

You can "fix" this yourself by creating a keymap that doesn't have the
bindings for those functions, and then installing it with "vared -M ...".
I don't think the confusion of creating a built-in vared keymap would be
worth the effort.
