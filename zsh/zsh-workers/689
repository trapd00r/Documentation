I know it isn't a new version, but zsh-2.6-beta1 has served me well, so I 
haven't updated it.  Now I've got a problem.  I was doing completions 
../somefile[tab] for a lengthy 'ln -s' command such as

ln -s ../11_1-Kings.txt ../12_2_Kings.txt ../13_1_Chronicles.txt 
../14_2_Chronicles.txt ../15_Ezra.txt ../16_Nehemiah.txt ../17_Ester.txt 
../18_Job.txt ../19_Psalms.txt ../20_Proverbs.txt ../21_Ecclesiastes.txt 
../22_Song_of_Solomon.txt ../23_Isaiah.txt ../24_Jeremiah.txt 
../25_Lamentations.txt ../26_Ezekiel.txt ../27_Daniel.txt ../28_Hosea.txt 
../29_Joel.txt ../30_Amos.txt ../31_Obadiah.txt ../32_Jonah.txt 
../33_Micah.txt ../34_Nahum.txt ../35_Habakkuk.txt ../36_Zephaniah.txt 
../37_Haggai.txt ../38_Zechar[tab]

*CRASH*
memory allocation error: attempt to free or realloc space not in heap

is this a problem which is fixed in a later version or am I just outta luck?

Thanks
TjL
