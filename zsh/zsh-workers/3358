One of my co-workers reports:

    zsh crashed on me, running in an emacs shell buffer, when I tried to
    cd to a file.

(I.e., the argument to cd was the name of a plain file, not a directory.)

We haven't reproduced this, and he has coredumpsize = 0 so I can't get a
trace from the process that dumped, but I thought somebody might have an
idea what to look for.
