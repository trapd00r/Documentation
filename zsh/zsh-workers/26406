Hi Bart,

Sorry, I wasn't trying to imply you are a liar, just pointing out that
for the implementation Peter checked in that your statement isn't
correct.  Your email was a response to Peter's patch, and I wanted to
clarify any confusion.

I haven't tried it, but I have no reason to believe that's not the
case.  I agree with you that this is not an earth-shattering fix, but
it is nice to have the separate local map and not have to muck with
user defined widgets.

Greg
