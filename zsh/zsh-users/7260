} from Emacs:

Running a shell in an emacs shell-mode buffer is entirely different than
running it in nearly any other circumstance.  Are you having this trouble=

anywhere OUTSIDE of emacs?  If not, perhaps its an emacs setting that
needs to be changed, rather than a zsh setting ...

The first thing to try is typing ctrl-j rather than return.  If that work=
s
to get zsh to recognize a command, try assigning TERM=3Demacs i.e.:

[bkhl@ackusativ ~/kurser/vt04/lp1/lab1]% TERM=3Demacs<ctrl-j>

You may get a complaint about the terminal type emacs not found, but zsh
may begin behaving a lot better.
