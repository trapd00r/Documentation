There are lots and lots of unchecked system calls; it would be very
useful to handle them better.  Fixing them up as well as consistently
handling the errors without, for example, file descriptor leaks needs a
lot of work.  (The fact we don't handle errors well at the moment is
probably actually a bonus from the latter point of view: we're just
closing a lot of file descriptors that are -1, which is useless but
harmless.)

The error message doesn't switch from network to host order; that's
easy to fix.

Which message is wrong?  There's no network order problem here, so it
must be something else.
