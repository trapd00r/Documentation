} 
} Right, but I'm not convinced it actually works.

It almost certainly *won't* work except in the most simple cases now that
ZLE is doing its own highlighting effects.  People are going to have to
decide whether they want that badly enough to use zle_highlight=(none).

Inevitably someone will complain that ZLE should put back whatever effect
was there before when it turns on/off its own effects.
