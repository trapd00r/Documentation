I don't particularly like the way this sounds, but..

+Version Suffixes
+----------------
+The configure script reads the version number from Config/version.mk.
+If the environment variable ZSH_EXTRAVERSION is set, the string
+contained therein will be appended to the version string.  For example,
+if Config/version.mk contains "VERSION=4.3.4-dev-7" and
+ZSH_EXTRAVERSION is set to "-ca", $ZSH_VERSION in the shell built from
+that run will equal "4.3.4-dev-7-ca".  Caution is recommended when
+using this feature, as is-at-least may misunderstand your conventions.
