Presumably it was in 'set', the variables known to zsh, and not 'env',
an external command which checks which variables are in the environment
(a list of strings exported to child processes).

It should be sufficient to just "export EDITOR".

You're using vi or some derivative and zsh has seen this and
automatically switched key-bindings to vi keybindings.  You want
"bindkey -e" to force Emacs key-bindings, despite using vi as a
text-editor.

Further, you want to set both EDITOR and "bindkey -e" in ~/.zshrc, *not*
in ~/.zshenv; note that .zshenv is for _all_ shells, including
non-interactive cron-jobs, etc.  .zshrc is for interactive shells.  You
(hopefully) only care about editors and ZLE input modes in interactive
shells.  :-)
