I've kept track of them. I think the only things missing are ones which
were only half finished - gpg, mplayer and the OpenBSD _bsd_pkg changes
earlier this month come to mind. There was also an ecasound completion
some while back which I think was finished but was never added. I'll
perhaps dig these out and add them. I'm not going to be available next
week though as I'm off skiing.

Anyway, I'll add the HTML Tidy completion. Thanks Doug.
