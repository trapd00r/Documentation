Hello Z Shellers,

I like using Eterm and I also like using prompt themes.  I recently
noticed that the "fade," "fire," and "elite" prompt themes only
display correctly in Konsole with Central European (ibm852) encoding
set from the "Settings" menu.  The only one that looks worth using is
"adam2."  Pretty cool but I like to change things up every now and then.

Has anyone gotten these to display properly in Eterm or xterm?  Has
anyone found a way to construct something similar that will work in
Eterm?  Please point me in the right direction.

Thanks,
Joel
