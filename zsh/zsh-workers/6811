After running for some time with menu-select on, I find it a bit unhandy
sometimes. When you have two-three files to select from it is much better to
quickly press TAB :-) in this case additional RETURN (to get out of menu-select)
becomes an annoyance.

I personally would prefer, if menu-select would be autostarted on cursor keys
(well, user-defined keys ...) In this case you could quickly cycle through a
couple of first matches; and if you happen to hit a really large list, have a
natural way to menu-select needed one.

Just an idea.
