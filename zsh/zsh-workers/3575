Common problem. Also happens with most XDM configurations.
I end up also putting everything in zshenv protected by a test:

        if [[ -z $MyEnv ]]; then
                export PATH=blablabla
                export CVS_RSH=ssh
                ...
        fi

my zlogin is always empty because I happen not to need to start anything when
logging in.
