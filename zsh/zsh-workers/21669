current CVS has some initial support for multubyte characters in completion=
=2E=20
It is still pretty incomplete but at least it does not crash immediately (a=
nd=20
gets as far as display and insert matches)

UNICODE support is now turned on automatically if configure beieves it is=20
avaialble.

Completion list formatting is completely broken for multibyte characters=20
currently, no need to report it :)
