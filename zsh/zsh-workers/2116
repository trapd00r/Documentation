I used a statement 'ls ...' with the pattern 'rc?.d/*[A-Z]'
and got lots of names with 'small' characters at the end !

It seems so far as if it happenes ONLY IF 'numericglobsort' is set!

Do I overlook something ? Or is that a bug ?

It seems (tested with different [_-_] margins) that
in the set of characters 'case' is ignored ?

This happened on Solaris 2.4, the zsh is Version 3.0.0
default-(automatic)-configured, compiled with gcc.
