That wasn't a suggestion, that was my noting that %j was broken in
exactly the same way.  (I'm using 4.1.1, FYI.)  I assume that the
reason for the failure is that the re-prompting is just a redraw, so
zsh does no re-evaluation of the prompt at that point.  I haven't had
a chance to look at it, though.
