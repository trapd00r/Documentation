Hi,

I have keys bound to vi-style editing but I still like the history-
incremental-search-backward function. Trouble is that when I'm in
the submenu and have the line I was looking for on the command
line, sometimes I want to edit the command line and leave the
submenu line. How do you do this easily w/out corrupting the
just-found-command?  By habit, I do ESC ESC and start typing but this
doesn't seem to free me from the submenu cleanly.

any suggestions as to what you all out there do for this would be
helpful.

just picking a nit.

thanks.
