} 
} Thats what i had originally thought .. but *C*f* would also produce the
} completion on _tar_archive  and not _file -/ (which would be my expected
} behavior from the -C switch).

How about [^f]#C* instead?  The important thing is that *f*C* should NOT
match.

} I'm planning writting a basic intro (that would only cover 3.1.9 as that
} is all i'm familiar with)

Have you had a look at http://sunsite.dk/zsh/ ?  In particular, look at
http://sunsite.dk/zsh/Guide/zshguide.html by Peter Stephenson <pws@csr.com>.
He might be interested in contributions.
