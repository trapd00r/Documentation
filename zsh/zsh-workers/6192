Are you meaning something like: start-group, ..., end-group?

In the beginning we had -[JV] set the group permanently (until the
next -[JV]) which was nearer to this but then I decided against it
because in more complex compctl's (or now: completion functions) you
would always have to use it to make sure that you know which group you 
are using. And with such a pair you would have to remember to reset
it. Also, to make this usable we would have to implement a kind of
stack, so that the end-group resets it to the previous group again.

Right, we might think about this. For me, the most important advantage 
of the current implementation is that it can easily share all the
parsing code with compctl. I might be convinced to change it, though.
