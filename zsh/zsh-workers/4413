There have been various getopts() patches, but this hadn't been fixed
up to the last I saw, Bernd Eggink's in
http://www.zsh.org/mla/workers/1998/msg00132.html
which looks like it hasn't appeared yet.

However, my link to www.zsh.org is awful, involving 22 hops and more
delays than Gatwick Airport, so I couldn't check for anything more
recent.  We could do with a mirror north of the Equator, even if it
was only the index.

Strange, though, because it's a fairly blatant bug...

% zsh -f
% fn() { local f; while getopts abcd f; do print $f; done; }
% fn -a
a
% fn -abc
b
c
% fn -abc
%

(Workaround, if you get very frustrated in the meanwhile:  finish all
options with a -:
% fn -abcd -
a
b
c
d
% fn -a -   
a
% fn -abc -
a
b
c
% fn -abc -
a
b
c
.)
