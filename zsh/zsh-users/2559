No, the behavior wasn't changed, only the manual was corrected, see
zsh-workers/5879. I /think/ we once had this (trying it first without
the `*'), but I don't remember when we lost it.

And, of course for the new completion system it's already there, just
use the `_match' completer with a configuration of `match_original=only'
or `match_original=yes'.

So, yes, the code in tricky.c can do this now (this was added in
5871), but I didn't change the behavior of compctl-style completion.
We could add an option to allow this for it, but should we? Or may
this be an incentive to go to the new completion system?

Bye
 Sven
