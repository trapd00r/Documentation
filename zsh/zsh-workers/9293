No, because it would annoy people, such as me.  I can't see any any real
advantage in dispensing with it after so long.  It exists in other shells,
too.

An ignored-patterns (probably better than ignored-strings) style would be
useful.  It could sensible replace ignored-suffixes, but we should still
maintain $fignore for compatibility, if necessary quoting the suffixes and
sticking a `*' in front, which is trivial.
