Thanks for the answer, Max.
I should have mentioned that I don't want to give up on the MENU_COMPLETE o=
ption. I like having a match inserted immediately after the first TAB hit. =
It's just where the cursor is set on this match that bothers me.

Here is an example:
Let's say the current directory contains three files called "fileone", "fil=
etwo" and "thirdfile".
The '^' character marks the cursor position I'm looking for.

cat ./[TAB] would become
cat ./fileone
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 ^

cat ./fi[TAB] would become
cat ./fileone
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 ^

cat ./file[TAB] would become
cat ./fileone
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 ^

cat ./fileo[TAB] would become
cat ./fileone
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 ^

The default behaviour always moves the cursor to the end of the match, like=
 the last case.

Best regards,
