} 
} That's not working right with negative arguments for me - an initial
} neg-argument is ignored both in what is displayed, and in the effect
} of the eventual argument.

Hmm, it works for me starting from zsh -f.  Note that you're not
supposed to replace the builtin neg-argument with anything, only
replace digit-argument with digit-argument-show.  Which means that
neg-argument doesn't put anything in the status line until you give
the first digit, then that should show up as a negative number.  I
should have made that clear.

If you want neg-argument to display the leading "-" you'll need to
use another wrapper.
