This works well inside the main shell --- we use something similar with
a "Meta" character to quote characters special to the shell.  This will
probably continue.

In the line editor, being able to access a character by index is fairly
fundamental.  Having to count every time we need to access a location
would be a big change.  It's better to have an array of the right type.
In other places we will need to pass a wchar_t or even a wint_t, but
this is better than having a multibyte string for every character.
