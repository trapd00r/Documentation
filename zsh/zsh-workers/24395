Hi,

using completion for git in the kernel tree is horribly slow. It takes
more than ten seconds to get the answer that no completion for “git log
o” is available. The reason might be that git ls-files gives 23,000 file
names and zsh puts them in an array. It there any chance to speed this
up?

Bye, Jörg.
