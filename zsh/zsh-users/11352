Hm, I don't know about the specifics of the native windows port of
zsh. But AFAIK, zsh versions v3 and above do not set $VERSION but
$ZSH_VERSION. I tried the above on a linux v2.6 system:

[snip]
zsh% echo this is a test |read aa bb cc
zsh% echo $aa $bb $cc
this is a test
zsh% echo $ZSH_VERSION
3.0.4
zsh% echo $VERSION

[snap]

I don't know if the technique used to make this possible on unixoid
systems is not applicable on windows systems.
