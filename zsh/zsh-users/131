You have to set the option `numericglobsort'.  This actually means you
get the same result however the numbers are matched, with * or <> for
example.  I think this was some unusual attempt at consistency.

Perhaps it's actually a bit counterintuitive.  Would it actually be
more sensible for <> always to produce globbing in numerical order?  I
haven't looked at the source but presumably it's not too hard.
