} Any idea why the su command re-suspends after the continue?

It appears to be this loop in bin_suspend():

1669	    if (jobbing) {
1670		/* stay suspended */
1671		while (gettygrp() != mypgrp) {
1672		    sleep(1);
1673		    if (gettygrp() != mypgrp)
1674			kill(0, SIGTTIN);
1675		}
1676		/* restore signal handling */
1677		signal_ignore(SIGTTOU);
1678		signal_ignore(SIGTSTP);
1679		signal_ignore(SIGTTIN);
1680	    }

However, that code has been there forever [*] so the actual problem must
lie in some change that's been made to tty process group handling.  I
would tend to suspect that zsh-workers/17859 is the culprit.
