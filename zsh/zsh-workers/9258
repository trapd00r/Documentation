I think DATADIR/zsh/VERSION/functions is better than
DATADIR/zsh/functions/VERSION because it enables us to collect version
specific stuff other than functions.  Also when a lazy administrater
install zsh-3.1.7 over zsh-3.1.6, a directory structure stays somewhat
clean.

Also, DATADIR/zsh/VERSION/site-functions and
DATADIR/zsh/site-functions should be exist for site specific
modifications and add-on packages.  Currently there is no add-on
packages, though.
