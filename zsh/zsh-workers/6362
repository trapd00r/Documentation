I had to add one C flag I forgot when running configure to Makefile. I
edited config.status, rerun it - and to my surprise it silently recreated
config.h. Normally, config.h is only created when it differs from existing
one (and was the case before). It resulted in recompilation of all ZSH
instead of only one module.
