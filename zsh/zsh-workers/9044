Is this really all that is needed? If I understand it correctly, this patch
simply makes `.' valid character for parameter names. It means, that both foo
and .bar.foo are put in the same (and the only) table ... both are happily
listed with `set' ... what's worse, it makes `foo.bar' hihgly ambiguous. It may
break scripts that do not expect `.' in parameter names ...

I'd expect `.' be treated as names separator - and only in context `.foo.bar'.
Thus `foo.bar' as identifier remains invalid alltogether (eliminating $foo.bar
ambiguity). We'll have default namespace for all names without dot and explicit
namespaces for name starting with dot. All commands should behave just as normal
Unix :-) - everything starting with dot is "hidden" by default. This should have
the minimum impact (as long, as users do not request namespaces, they simply do
not see them at all).
