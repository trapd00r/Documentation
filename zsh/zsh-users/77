under 2.6-beta1:

through no one's fault but my own, I keep losing my history file  
(usually happens when I start a shell and then abort it before it  
gets going).

Often I have another shell running, which seems to remember the  
full history, even though the file itself is gone.

Is there a way I can dump the history into a new file?? Before you  
say "use the history command!", I tried, and it only gives me the  
history which the current shell has, rather than the history all the  
way down to event #1

thanks

TjL
