I'm starting to mess with completion.  (God help us all)

Could someone mail me some well commented example compleations?
Specifically programable ones.  My first task is figuring out how to
complete out of the passwd file account names.  (It'd be nice for root to
be able to complete the passwd command...  As I spend at least 10 minutes
each day reseting forgotten passwords... <sigh>)

Thanks for your time;
Jason
