    Hi Arno,

    IMO you don't have to be too sorry. The themes are there just to
    show off what can be done in zsh. At least, I haven't found any of
    the themes (those that I tried) anywhere near usable. (No offence to
    the authors intended.)

    Just whip up your own prompt; you can add features as you continue
    to discover zsh.
