<H1 ID="S7"><SPAN CLASS="chapnum">7</SPAN><BR>Using Two Sessions, Windows, and the Copy and Paste Feature</H1>
<P>This chapter describes how to:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Run two computer sessions on your terminal at the same time.</LI>
<LI>Select and use windows.</LI>
<LI>Copy and paste text between sessions.</LI>
</UL>
<P>With two sessions, your VT420 becomes two terminals in one. You can
also use the VT420 as a conventional one-session terminal.</P>
<P>Running two sessions offers many advantages. For example, you can
easily display and compare data from two different jobs at the same
time. To display data from two sessions, you divide the screen into two
<DFN><A HREF="glossary.html#WINDOW">windows</A></DFN>. You can also copy and paste text from one session to another.</P>
<H2 ID="S7.1">What Are Sessions?</H2>
<P>A video terminal lets you exchange information with a computer system.
In order to communicate with the host system, you must open a session
from your terminal. A <DFN><A HREF="glossary.html#SESSION">session</A></DFN> is an active connection between the
terminal and a host system. On many systems, you open a session by
logging in to the system.</P>
<H2 ID="S7.2">Two Sessions</H2>
<P>The VT420 lets you run two sessions at the same time. Opening two
sessions is easy. After you set up the VT420 for two sessions, you can
use the <SPAN CLASS="keyname">F4</SPAN> (Session) key to move back and forth between two sessions.
The session you are using is called the <DFN><A HREF="glossary.html#ACTIVE">active session</A></DFN>. The next section
describes how to open two sessions.</P>
<P>You can connect the VT420 to a host computer, a <DFN><A HREF="glossary.html#TERMINAL">terminal server</A></DFN>, or a
<DFN><A HREF="glossary.html#MODEM">modem</A></DFN>. This means you can run two sessions on the same host system or
on two different systems.</P>
<H2 ID="S7.3">Opening Two Sessions</H2>
<P>The VT420 uses a communication cable to exchange information with a
computer. You can use one or two communication cables for two sessions.
To use one cable, your system must have Digital's Session Support Utility
software or a terminal server that supports multiple sessions.</P>
<P>Chapters <A HREF="chapter2.html">2</A> and <A HREF="chapter3.html">3</A> describe how to install communication cables and set
up the terminal for two sessions. This section describes how to use two
sessions after you set up the terminal correctly.</P>
<P>The way you open two sessions depends on how many communication
cables you use. The following sections describe how to open two sessions
if you use:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Two cables</LI>
<LI>One cable and SSU software</LI>
<LI>One cable and a terminal server that supports multiple sessions</LI>
</UL>
<H3 ID="S7.3.1">If You Use Two Cables</H3>
<P>This section describes how to open two sessions if you use two
communication cables.</P>
<P CLASS="note">IMPORTANT: Make sure your VT420 is set up correctly before you try to open
two sessions. <A HREF="chapter3.html">Chapter 3</A> describes how to set up the terminal for
two sessions using two cables.</P>
<H4>Session 1</H4>
<P>You open session 1 the way you normally do on your host system. The
VT420 always connects you to the system assigned to session 1. This
assignment is based on the cable connections at the rear of the terminal.
To assign a system to a session, you use the <STRONG>terminal comm ports</STRONG>
feature in the Global Set-Up screen.</P>
<H4>Session 2</H4>
<P>After you open session 1, you press the <SPAN CLASS="keyname">F4</SPAN> (Session) key and open session
2 the same way you opened session 1. When you press <SPAN CLASS="keyname">F4</SPAN> (Session), the
VT420 maintains session 1. The session can still receive information from
the host system. No information is lost.</P>
<P>If your terminal does not respond correctly when you press <SPAN CLASS="keyname">F4</SPAN> (Session),
repeat the set-up procedure for two sessions in <A HREF="chapter3.html">Chapter 3</A>.</P>
<H4>Example</H4>
<P>The following example shows you how to open (log in to) two sessions on
one of Digital's VAX/VMS systems:</P>
<P CLASS="note">NOTE: The <CITE>Guide to Using VMS</CITE> provides detailed information on how to
log in to the VMS operating system.</P>
<P><STRONG>To open session 1:</STRONG></P>
<OL>
<LI>Turn on the VT420 and wait for the screen to display <TT>VT420 OK</TT>.</LI>
<LI>Press the <SPAN CLASS="keyname">Return</SPAN> key to tell the system you want to log in.</LI>
<LI>The system prompts you for your user name. Enter your <EM>user name</EM>
and press <SPAN CLASS="keyname">Return</SPAN>.</LI>
<LI>The system prompts you for your password. Enter your <EM>password</EM> and
press <SPAN CLASS="keyname">Return</SPAN>.</LI>
</OL>
<P>The system does not display your password. When you correctly type your
name and password, the system displays a VAX/VMS version number and
a $ (dollar sign) prompt. The $ indicates you have logged into session 1
successfully.</P>
<P>The login sequence looks like this:</P>
<P><SPAN CLASS="keyname">Return</SPAN><BR>
<TT>Username:</TT> <KBD>Smith</KBD> <SPAN CLASS="keyname">Return</SPAN><BR>
<TT>Password: (not displayed)</TT> <SPAN CLASS="keyname">Return</SPAN></P>
<P><STRONG>To open session 2:</STRONG> Press the <SPAN CLASS="keyname">F4</SPAN> (Session) key and repeat the login
sequence.</P>
<H3 ID="S7.3.2">If You Use One Cable</H3>
<P>If your system has Digital's SSU software or a Digital terminal server
that supports multiple sessions, you can run two sessions over one
communication cable. Your system manager can tell you if your system
has either one.</P>
<H4>If Your System has SSU Software</H4>
<P>If your system has Digital's SSU software, use the following procedure to
run two sessions over one communication cable:</P>
<P CLASS="note">IMPORTANT: Make sure your VT420 is set up correctly before you try to open
two sessions. <A HREF="chapter3.html">Chapter 3</A> describes how to set up the terminal for
two sessions, using one cable and SSU software.</P>
<H4>Session 1</H4>
<P>To open session 1:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Log into your host system the way you normally do.</LI>
<LI><P>Enable SSU with two sessions on your terminal line.</P>
<P>On a VAX/VMS system, enter the following command at the $ prompt:</P>
<P><TT>$</TT> <KBD>SSU ENABLE</KBD> <SPAN CLASS="keyname">Return</SPAN></P>
<P>The terminal should display the following response on the status line
at the bottom of the screen:</P>
<P><TT>Done</TT></P>
<P>The first session is now open.</P></LI>
</OL>
<P CLASS="note">NOTE: If you type information before the <TT>Done</TT> message appears on the

</OL>
<H4>If Your Terminal Server Supports Multiple Sessions</H4>
<P>The DECserver 200 and DECserver 300 terminal servers support multiple
sessions. If your system has one of these terminal servers, you can use
the following procedures to run two sessions over one communication
cable. First, you must define your terminal server port for multiple-session
use.</P>
<H4>Defining Your Terminal Port for Multiple Sessions</H4>
<OL>
<LI>Turn on the VT420 and wait for the screen to display <TT>VT420 OK</TT>.</LI>

<H3 ID="S7.3.3">Restoring an Interrupted SSU Session</H3>
<P>You can restore sessions that are interrupted by one of the following
events:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Turning the terminal off when it is still connected to the terminal
server</LI>
<LI>A power failure or similar problem</LI>
</UL>
<P>When a session is interrupted, the VT420 or the host system may lose
the context of the current session. After the terminal and system regain
communication, you can restore the context of the interrupted session
without canceling the session and starting over again.</P>
<P><STRONG>To restore a session:</STRONG> Press the <SPAN CLASS="keyname">F4</SPAN> (Session) key.</P>
<H3 ID="S7.3.4">SSU Screen and Error Messages</H3>
<P>The VT420 displays SSU screen and error messages on the line at the
bottom of your screen. The messages disappear when you press any
keyboard key.</P>
<P>The following paragraphs describe each SSU message. If the message
is an error message, the keyboard's warning bell rings twice before the

</UL>
<H2 ID="S7.4">Which Session is Active?</H2>
<P>You can display information from two sessions at the same time, by using
windows. However, you can only enter information in one session at a
time. There are two ways you can tell which session is active.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Look at the keyboard indicator line. The active session number appears
in the first field at the left of the line.</LI>
<LI><P>Look at the cursors. The active session usually has a blinking cursor.
The inactive session has a steady cursor.</P>
<P CLASS="note">NOTE: The cursor blink feature in the Display Set-Up screen lets you
select a blinking or steady cursor for the current session.</P></LI>
<LI>Type a keyboard character. The software application will display the
character in the active session.</LI>
</UL>
<H2 ID="S7.5">Number of Lines/Screen</H2>
<P>You can display 24, 25, 36, or 48 lines of information at one time on
the screen. By default, 24 lines are visible at one time (excluding the
status line at the bottom of the screen). If you display 36 or 48 lines on
the screen, the size of the characters will be smaller. The <STRONG>lines/screen</STRONG>
feature in the Display Set-Up screen controls how many lines you can see
on the screen at one time.</P>
<P>The number of lines on the screen also depends on the number of lines on
a page in page memory. For example, if you select 48 lines/screen but the
page size is 24 lines, then you will only see 24 lines of information from
that session. This is the case even if there is room for more lines on the
screen. If you are running two sessions, you can select 48 lines/screen to
display 24 lines in each session.</P>
<H3 ID="S7.5.1">How to Change the Number of Lines/Screen</H3>
<P>The number of lines on the screen is a user preference feature. You
may have terminal management software that automatically selects
the appropriate number of lines on the screen. However, if you want to
change the setting manually, use the following procedure:</P>
<P CLASS="note">NOTE: If you are running two sessions and you want to change the
number of lines/screen setting for each session, you must make
the change for each session individually.</P>
<P>The Display Set-Up screen contains the <STRONG>lines/screen</STRONG> feature.</P>

<H2 ID="S7.6">Windows</H2>
<P>A <DFN><A HREF="glossary.html#WINDOW">window</A></DFN> is an area of the screen that displays information from one
session. You can divide the VT420 screen into two windows by opening
two sessions.</P>
<P>The amount of information you can display is determined by:</P>
<UL>
<LI>The number of windows you are using (1 or 2)</LI>
<LI>The page size you are using. Pages in screen memory may be larger than
the number of lines available on the screen.</LI>
<LI>The number of lines/screen you choose in the Display Set-Up screen.</LI>
</UL>
<H3 ID="S7.6.1">One Window</H3>
<P>Normally, the VT420 uses a full-screen window. In this window, you
can only display one session at a time. A full-screen window lets you
display 24, 25, 36, or 48 lines of text in 80 or 132 columns. If you use two

<H4>Tips on Using Windows</H4>
<P>If the <STRONG>vertical coupling</STRONG> feature is enabled, data on the screen may
appear to skip up and down when you move the cursor beyond the top
and bottom border of a window. The skipping occurs because the VT420
must update the screen to keep the cursor visible.</P>
<P>This problem occurs most often with applications that involve frequent
cursor action (for example, word processors). Here are a few suggested
solutions:</P>
<UL>
<LI><P>Disable the <STRONG>vertical coupling</STRONG> feature in the Display Set-Up screen.
This step will stop the skipping motion on the screen. However, the
cursor will disappear if it moves to an area of the terminal's memory
that is not on the screen.</P>
<P>For example, if you split the screen so that each session displays 12
lines of text, the cursor will disappear if it moves to line 13 in either
session.</P></LI>
<LI><P>Set the application to use only the number of lines actually displayed.
When you split the screen horizontally, the terminal displays 12 lines
in each session by default. Many applications have commands to limit
the number of lines available for editing. Here are two examples.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Digital's EDT editor has a SET LINES command that lets you specify
the number of lines available for editing. If you set the number of
lines to match the <STRONG>lines/screen</STRONG> feature in the Display Set-Up screen
when you use two windows, the skipping motion on the screen stops.</LI>
<LI>Digital's VMS operating system has a SET TERMINAL/PAGE=nn
command. This command lets you specify the number of lines used
on the screen. Several VMS utilities and applications use this
information to limit the number of lines used. If you set the PAGE
to one less than the number of displayed lines, applications such as
HELP, NOTES, MAIL and the TPU editor (EVE and EDT sections)
perform well when you use two windows.</LI>
</UL></LI>
</UL>
<H2 ID="S7.7">Panning</H2>
<P>You can pan the window for the active session, to view more data in page
memory. <DFN><A HREF="glossary.html#PANNING">Panning</A></DFN> a window is similar to panning a camera. When you
pan a camera over a subject, you can see different parts of the subject
while standing in the same position. When you pan a window, you can see
another part of page memory without moving the window on the screen.</P>
<H3 ID="S7.7.1">How to Pan</H3>
<P>You can pan a window up or down. You can also pan to another page in

<H2 ID="S7.8">Copying and Pasting Text</H2>
<P>The VT420 provides a simple procedure for copying and pasting data
within an active session or between two active sessions. The VT420 stores
the copied data in a buffer before sending the data to the host. The paste
buffer can hold one 24-line page of text data.</P>
<H3 ID="S7.8.1">Copying Text into the Paste Buffer</H3>
<P>To copy text into the paste buffer:</P>
<OL>
<LI><P>Press and hold the <SPAN CLASS="keyname">F1</SPAN> (Copy) key down for the rest of the copy
operation. If the cursor was not visible, it appears when you press
<SPAN CLASS="keyname">F1</SPAN> (Copy).</P>
<P CLASS="note">NOTE: Releasing <SPAN CLASS="keyname">F1</SPAN> (Copy) before completing the copy operation
cancels the operation.</P></LI>
<LI>Use the arrow keys to position the cursor at the beginning of the text
you want to copy.</LI>
<LI>With the cursor at the beginning of the text you want to copy, press the
<SPAN CLASS="keyname">Select</SPAN> key.</LI>
<LI>Use the arrow keys to position the cursor one character beyond the
end of the text you want to copy. As you move the cursor, the terminal
underlines the text you are copying.</LI>
<LI>Press the <SPAN CLASS="keyname">Remove</SPAN> key, then release <SPAN CLASS="keyname">F1</SPAN> (Copy).</LI>
</OL>
<P>After you complete the copy operation, the terminal places the copied text
in the paste buffer and erase the underline from the text on the screen.</P>
<H3 ID="S7.8.2">Pasting Text</H3>
<P>After you copy text to the terminal's paste buffer, you can paste the text
into an active session. When you paste the text, it appears on the screen
as if it were typed from the keyboard. You can paste text into a file. To
paste text:</P>
<OL>
<LI><P>If you are editing a file, use the arrow keys to position the cursor where
you want to paste the text.</P>
<P>If you are at the command level, text will appear on the command line
when you paste it.</P></LI>
<LI>Press and hold the <SPAN CLASS="keyname">F1</SPAN> (Copy) key down while you press the <SPAN CLASS="keyname">Insert</SPAN> key.</LI>
<LI>Release <SPAN CLASS="keyname">F1</SPAN> (Copy).</LI>
</OL>
<P>The terminal sends a copy of the text in the paste buffer to the active
session. The text also remains in the paste buffer until you:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Copy additional text, or</LI>
<LI>Turn the terminal off.</LI>
</UL>
<P>The following figure shows an example of copying and pasting text from
one active session to another:</P>

<UL>
<LI>You can copy up to 24 lines of 132 characters at one time.</LI>
<LI>If you try to copy non-ASCII characters, such as graphics information,
the VT420 sends blank spaces in place of those characters.</LI>
<LI>If you release the <SPAN CLASS="keyname">F1</SPAN> (Copy) key before completing the copy or paste
operation, the terminal cancels the operation.</LI>
<LI>If you set the transmit baud rate to <TT>Transmit=19200</TT> of higher in
the Communications Set-Up screen, a copy and paste operation may
send data to the host computer faster than the host can receive the
data. When you are using the VMS operating system, type the SET
TERM/HOSTSYNC command to control data flow and prevent the loss
of data.</LI>
