It's been a long while since I looked at the prompt theming stuff.  I
really should get around to tidying it up soon.

However, I just noticed:

% <load in Misc/colors>
% echo "$fg_bold[green]foo$fg_bold[grey]bar"

yields the 'bar' in green.  That can't be right can it?  I'm a bit
relunctant to delve in the murky depths of Misc/color as it's changed
a lot since I last touched it.
