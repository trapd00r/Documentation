Well, Peter's commented that the zsh list software won't give out addresses.  
In any case, I wonder how many addresses there are that are gettable from list 
servers?  I'd guess it would be perhaps O(10^4), perhaps O(10^5).  If I 
believe some of the spam I get offering email lists, O(10^6) is the kind of 
figure that's typical.  Mailing lists just strike me as too small to be worth 
the effort of writing the software to interrogate them all.
