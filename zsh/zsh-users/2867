mmmh, I'm using zsh-3.1.6, and supose this case:

% ls
Test File - Od.txt     Test File - Oddie.txt
  #That was Test<TAB>
% ls Test\ File\ -\ Od
  #                   ^ Cursor is Here
  # When hitting <TAB> again simply Nothing happens....
  # And of course autolist & listambiguous are set

I would like to see if it's my system's problem (well, I'm at the
University now) or it's a generic problem (I supose I'll test this tonight
at home).
