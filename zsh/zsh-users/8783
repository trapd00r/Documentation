Works fine here with Cygwin zsh 4.2.4:

[prompt] > kala
#!/bin/zsh

echo -E $*
[prompt] chmod +x kala
[prompt] ./kala 'c:\kala\lahna.txt'
c:\kala\lahna.txt

It is probably that convert_path thing of yours that doesn't work.
For example, if I had omitted -E from my example, the output would
have been "c:kalalahna.txt".
