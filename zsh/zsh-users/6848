Greetings,

If I want a pattern that matches all files in the current directory
and its descendant directories excluding files in directories named
CVS, why doesn't

**/*~**/CVS/*(.)

work?  Files in "$(pwd)/CVS" are not excluded with that pattern and
instead I have to say

**/*~CVS/*~**/CVS/*(.)

which feels a bit too verbose.  Any solutions?
