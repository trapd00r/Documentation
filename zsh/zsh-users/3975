Because the function itself is job %1.  It doesn't show up in the output
of "jobs" because it's being executed within the current shell process,
but it still has a job table entry.

You can't.  Even if the function didn't use up one job slot, what if
there were some other background job already running?

Why is it important that it be the first job?
