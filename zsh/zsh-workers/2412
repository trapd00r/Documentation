It's been a while since I looked at the source for something like
GNU cat, but I remember it being quite a bit of code (relative to
what it does).  Also I believe it takes quite a bit of work to
write portable code that uses mmap().

I think of the multio as more of a convenience, rather than being
faster just because it is built into the shell.  For scripting
purposes (where speed is more important), you can just use
"cat a b c | whatever".

I think it would be sufficient to just output an error message
such as "max multio's is 16", when someone tries
"whatever < *".  They should use "cat * | whatever" instead.

We should probably mention this limit in the man pages.
