Correct.

I know.

I'm not subscribed to the devel mailing list.

I'm only subscribed to the user list. So I only got one article and
had no problem. Hitting the follow-up button on MG's article shows the
devel and the user mailing list.

So I thought he sent his article to the devel and the user. Maybe he
sent it only to devel - I don't know.

I suspected that you - the developers - got it twice. But anyway: *I*
didn't have any problem with that.

Nevertheless: there has to be a reason why your and his article has a
"Newsgroups: gmane.comp.shells.zsh.devel,gmane.comp.shells.zsh.user"
and mine and DN's for example show only "Newsgroups:
gmane.comp.shells.zsh.user".
