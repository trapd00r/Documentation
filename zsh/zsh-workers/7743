Forgive me, but I recently had no time to follow all discussions and do not
quite understand the manual description.

1. When are the description of arguments actually printed? I tried some basic
commands like xterm or patch but descriptions do not seem to be printed.

2. Looks, like `-s' is overloaded - it is used both for "single letter options"
and for "option aliases" (from _long_options). I believe, this is the reason why
option aliases do not work any more :-) E.g. ntpd configure lists only --enable
variant - and now no --disable counterparts are recognised.

3. I cannot make completion for patch work. As simple as `patch --sTAB' just
beeps.

4. `patch -pTAB' gives me `patch -p0 ' - but `0' is not autoremoved if I enter
different number (I'd expect it to be).

5. `patch TAB' does not list most of the long options at all. Actually, it is
interesting case - if a command has both long and short form - which one should
be preferred? I'd like to have short option only if no corresponding short one
exists.

TIA
