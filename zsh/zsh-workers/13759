Hmm, so SHINSTDIN is true, but in fact the shell is not reading commands
from stdin ... yet commands started by the shell read from the actual stdin,
not from where the shell is reading commands from ... I suppose one can get
some interesting effects this way, but is it really the correct behavior?
