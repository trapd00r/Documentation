Subject: bug in _describe
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Completion of conditions no longer works:

% [[ -<tab>
(eval):1: error in flags

I'm fairly certain that this was introduced in 15415. Error comes from
line 57 of _describe. It is not accounting for arrays specified as '(
... )' instead of actual array names.
