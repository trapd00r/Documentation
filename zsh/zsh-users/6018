	- - Thanks for your helpful comment. But I'd rather not install 50 Mb of
run environment to use zsh. I certainly use other GNU tools, but a full
Cygwin install is not what I want.

>> 	- Where can I find binaries for Windows?

	- - Thanks for your helpful comment. But I'd rather not install 50 Mb of

>> me it is version 3.0.5-nt-beta-0.75 and I find it a bit too old...
>The port is not maintained for two years ("I_no_longer_work_on_zsh"). 

	- - Yes, I saw that. But I've never compiled and built anything
successfully. I was hoping that someone here also used Windows and had
successfully built a newer version for Windows. Visiting the FTP site and
downloading the sources, I was dismayed to see build instructions for so
many platforms, even Mac, but no mention of Windows whatsoever! It's almost
like it was excluded intently. It was possible with that 3.0.5-nt-beta
version, so I can only wonder if any technical difficulty makes it
impossible for newer versions to be built in Windows too...

>thorsten@freki% echo $ZSH_VERSION

	- - Congratulations!
