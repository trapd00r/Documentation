I found the following bug in zsh-2.6-beta20 and beta21:

I typed in the following:

exec <3 <(ls -l)

--->  zsh: no such file or directory: 3

So far so good, but after that it seems that zle is broken as the up
arrow does not retrieve the last command entered.  Instead, the cursor
just goes up.  The tab character does not perform completion anymore,
it just inserts a TAB.  This was on a xterm window.

I run zsh on HP-UX 9.01 and compiled it with the HP C compiler.
