Zsh does not handle multibyte character sets, in general.  Internally it
always treats a single byte as a single character.  The characters with
ASCII values above 128 are meta-characters, and those in the range 128-
159 are control-meta-characters (just as 0-31 are control without meta).

In short, anything you're able to do with UTF-8 works by accident rather
than by design.  We haven't yet undertaken the massive rewrite that will
be necessary to convert to using double-byte or variable-width characters.
