Quoting rules are described quite precisely in POSIX which just documents
the usuall shell behaviour.  Note that in a strict POSIX shell
export MAILPATH=~/mbox:~/Mail/zsh does not expand the tildes but zsh does
similarily to other shells (but bash/ksh/pdksh probably disables this
expansion when POSIXLY_CORRECT is set).  The most portable is
MAILPATH=~/mbox:~/Mail/zsh ; export MAILPATH

About MAILPATH: bash does expand the mailpath component before checking the
file so in bash MAILPATH=~/mbox:~/Mail/zsh" works.  However AT&T ksh, pdksh
and zsh does not do that.
