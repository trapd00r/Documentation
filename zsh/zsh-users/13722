This is so that an entire file name is generally considered to be a
single word.  The zsh emacs bindings are not really emacs bindings,
they're a sort of best approximation of the semantics of words from
the old BSD 4.x TTY driver combined with (most of) the keybindings
of emacs circa the same time period (early 90s).

The idea was to be unsurprising to people who came from a shell that
did not have its own editor, but usable for people familiar with
emacs.  Hence the default binding of ctrl+w to backward-kill-word
rather than to kill-region.

There are a lot of zsh features that are like that, which people who
never lived in the time when most shells didn't subsume editors tend
now to interpret as bugs.

Correct.

} with the default value of WORDCHARS?

% zsh -fc 'typeset -p WORDCHARS'
typeset WORDCHARS='*?_-.[]~=/&;!#$%^(){}<>'
