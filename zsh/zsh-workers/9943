} Had a quick look at this ... unfortunately, the way prompt truncation
} is now calculated, the knowledge of what strings were contained inside
} %{...%} has been lost by the time we start computing the truncation.

Minor correction:  It hasn't been lost -- it's represented by Inpar and
Outpar tokens in the prompt string, but prompttruncate() doesn't look
for them -- it just does pointer arithmetic and memmove().  It's going
to be only a little bit tricky to fix it.
