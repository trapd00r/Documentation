Because in that call to _arguments there is no description for the -p
option, so it thinks that is the first (and then-only) argument.

This can be fixed by telling _arguments the options it has to expect
but not to complete, using the '!-p' syntax.  Alternatively one could
use -A '-*' to say that all unknown string beginning with a hyphen are 
to be `ignored' there.
