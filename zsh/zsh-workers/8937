} The test driver script is Test/ztst.zsh; run `make tests' in
} Test to run the test(s).

It might be reasonable to change this to "make check" which is what is
expected for packages configured with "automake" (which zsh isn't, but
just for consistency).  Or leave it "make tests" in the Test directory,
but add

check:
	cd Test ; $(MAKE) tests

to the top-level Makefile.in.
