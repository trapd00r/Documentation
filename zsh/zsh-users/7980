Hello,

I just tried that:

% bzcat ../patch-2.6.9-rc1.bz2 ../patch-2.6.9-rc1-bk<1-19>.bz2<TAB>

and obtained:

bzcat ../patch-2.6.9-rc1.bz2 ../patch-2.6.9-rc1-bk10.bz2 ../patch-2.6.9-rc1-bk11.bz2 ../patch-2.6.9-rc1-bk12.bz2 ../patch-2.6.9-rc1-bk13.bz2 ../patch-2.6.9-rc1-bk14.bz2 ../patch-2.6.9-rc1-bk15.bz2 ../patch-2.6.9-rc1-bk16.bz2 ../patch-2.6.9-rc1-bk17.bz2 ../patch-2.6.9-rc1-bk18.bz2 ../patch-2.6.9-rc1-bk19.bz2 ../patch-2.6.9-rc1-bk1.bz2 ../patch-2.6.9-rc1-bk2.bz2 ../patch-2.6.9-rc1-bk3.bz2 ../patch-2.6.9-rc1-bk4.bz2 ../patch-2.6.9-rc1-bk5.bz2 ../patch-2.6.9-rc1-bk6.bz2 ../patch-2.6.9-rc1-bk7.bz2 ../patch-2.6.9-rc1-bk8.bz2 ../patch-2.6.9-rc1-bk9.bz2

which really suprised my as I thought the whole point of the <-> pattern
was to allow for an ordered sequence to be returned (contrary to a
simple *).

Am I mistaken in that belief?
