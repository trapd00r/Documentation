The point is, these bindings clash with standard vi usage. Dead-heart vi'ers
do many things automatically; ESC-/ is one of them - and here the above
bindings cut in.

Zsh just tries bind too much by default; probably, compinit should just
redefine standard context-sensitive completion bindings leaving everything
else to user choice. But then we need some simple framework to selectively
activate additional bindings.

The problem is, most people on this list seem to use emacs mode; I was the
last one but switched to emacs as well (in part because of subtle rpoblems
with new completion in emacs mode).
