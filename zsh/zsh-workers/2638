Isn't that too much?  Presently one can see some usefulness in
CSH_JUNKIE_QUOTES which warns about unfinished quotes.  But this patch
which really implements this braindead csh behaviour makes it completely
unusable.  It does increase csh compatibility but zsh cannot be fully csh
compatible so I do not really see its usefulness.
