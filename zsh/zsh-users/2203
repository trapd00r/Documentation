Thanks.  Unfortunately it wouldn't apply against 3.1.5, and I couldn't
find a way to patch it manually; it looks like there were too many other
changes since then.

I picked up the zsh-3.1.5-pws-11 archive from Peter's page, but I'm
curious when a new beta version (3.1.6?) might be released.  How does
that usually work?
