Yes, my LC_CTYPE is en_US.UTF-8, here's a bt full

and inside the last bit
(gdb) print zlemetacs_qsub
$3 = 2

1450			if (itype_end(tt, IIDENT, 1) == tt)
(gdb) print nclen

(gdb) print tt
$8 = 0x82d7248 ""

As a curiousity, I couldn't reproduce the bug as my user now, but it
"worked" as root, or if I did the cd .. twice.
