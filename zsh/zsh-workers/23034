Only that, as you say, there's already a lot of handling for this in the
icky C code which I'm not going anywhere near.

I think it was written to be simple to use from something less
configurable than the present system (i.e. compctl).  Nowadays it would
make more sense to handle it all as a completer which decide whether it
would do expansion or completion and in the latter case might
temporarily hide the other branches of the expansion.
