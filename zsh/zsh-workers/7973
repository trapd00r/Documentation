I was thinking about uses as in `_path_files' where we have
`$linepath${testpath:q}' (yes, this could be changed to `(q)' some
time). The only thing I wanted to point out that having *only* the
put-in-quotes style would be ugly in such cases (and I knew about the
`${:-...}' trick, of course, but in contexts like `_pth_files' I would 
like to avoid the quotes altogether).

And I didn't want to say that I would be against changing the
behaviour of `:q' as long as we still have the possibility to get
backslashes with the `(q)' flag.
