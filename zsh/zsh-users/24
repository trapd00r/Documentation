Hi,

In csh, typing

history

gives a list of the last few numbered commands along with a start and stop
time of each command.

In zsh, history gives the last few numbered commands but no time info.
I couldn't find an option in the manual for turning on time info.

Anybody know how to do this w/out losing some functionality?

thanks.
