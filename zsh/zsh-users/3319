 i know and i am quite happy with many completions. And don't get
 me wrong. I am trying to learn how to do them myself. Perhaps i
 should send my versions and ask questions to understand the
 completion system better. But i am feeling like a Silliest
 Possible User already :)

I hope so, too.

And what about the ability to have a special site for fg. Linux.
Would that make some sense? I mean i guess that many people would
love a site like that. And that should not be the goal of a
ZSH-distribution to ship with as many completions for Linux as
possible. So perhaps a site dedicated would be cool.
The gurus could then judge what should be included with ZSH
itself. Just an idea for discussion.
