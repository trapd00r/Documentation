In how recent a zsh?  I can't seem to get that working with 4.3.4.
Does it require a copy compiled out of the latest {CVS,SVN} HEAD?  (I
have no idea what VCS zsh uses, or the url to checkout a copy.
Forgive my ignorance.  ^_^ )

If I get a chance later, and no one beats me to the punch, I'll clean
up the code I'm using with $jobtexts and post that, for those of us
who need to use 4.3.2 or later on some machines thanks to lazy
sysadmins.
