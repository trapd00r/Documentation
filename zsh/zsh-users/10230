The usual way to lock within shell scripts is to use ln. This works on all
UNIX like systems because creating a hard link (with ln) is an atomic
operation which fails if the target already exists. Your example above can be
written like this:

    while ! ln file file.lock 2>/dev/null
    do
        sleep 1
    done
    # Lock obtained

    print foo bar baz >>file
    # do a whole lot of other stuff to "file"

    rm -f file.lock
    # Lock released

Wrapping this idiom into lock/unlock functions is left as an exercise for the
reader. :-)
