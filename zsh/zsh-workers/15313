That looks fine.  In fact, (a.type != MN_UNSET) should be enough, because
it will always be marked as unset if (what == EQ), but I wouldn't lose
sleep over that.

I looked to see if this is going to have further ramifications since
there's no type coercion until the actual point of setting, but I couldn't
find a case where it makes a difference (this almost is the point of
setting, since that's all that equals does apart from returning the
value/type just set).
