} 
} "allopt" was the way to go before "set -o" was introduced recently.
} Before that you had to do "setopt kshoptionprint; setopt; unsetopt"

"allopt" could be improved by switching to "set -o" but that isn't
really why it was written.  It was written to eliminate the double
negatives in the output.

Run

    diff =(set -o) =(allopt)

and you'll see e.g.

3c3
< noalwayslastprompt    off
---
> alwayslastprompt      on

(etc.)
