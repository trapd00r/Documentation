I was finally tired by these "? cscope.out" so I added it to top level and Src
.cvsignore (sometimes I do it from Src ...). I hope, nobody objects.

BTW I was very pleased to see that cscope finally went opensource (much thanks
to SCO for releasing it). I prefer it over tags because it can find all uses
of an identifier, not just definitions (global can as well, but I could not
find how to use it with Vim). And it is well suppported by Vim. Current
version finally added directory recursion (that was pain to get before) so it
is really usable.
