Subject: Bug in _gnu_generic for "cp -a"?

Hi,

I always had "compdef _gnu_generic cp" in my zsh completion config.

I don't remember since which version of zsh
but at least for a couple months now I get this:

 condor:~> cp -a .zshr<TAB>
 - -a -

instead of file completion.  Only for the parameter "-a"!

I guess I'll just won't use _gnu_generic for cp anymore
but do you have any idea why this is happening?
Are there any drawbacks of not using _gnu_generic?

Cheers,
 Andy.
