Btw, after having a look at `_arguments' when this first came up: if I
ever come to this, I wouldn't turn the whole of `_arguments' into C,
but instead add only support for the argument- and command-line-parsing.
Probably made a bit more generic so that we could use this is other
places, too.

Has anyone had ideas for other things we might want to add support in
C for?
