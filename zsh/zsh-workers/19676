RFC2732 has been brought to my attention, which suggests for URIs:

http://[FEDC:BA98:7654:3210:FEDC:BA98:7654:3210]:80/index.html

so we would have something like:

zfopen '[FEDC:BA98:7654:3210:FEDC:BA98:7654:3210]:21'

It's not backwardly compatible, but literal IPv6 addresses are currently
so rare that this might be a good time to make sure they don't break
anything.
