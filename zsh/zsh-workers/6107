Subject: change in automenu/autolist effects between 3.0.5 & 3.1.5

Hi,

first of all i can say Zsh is the shell i like the best.

But here is what i dislike :

- i had zsh v3.0.5. Then, if automenu and autolist were set, (and
not
menucomplete), having such a situation:
touch abcdef
touch abcwxyz,
when you hit TAB after
'ls ab' is typed,
you got at the _same time_ a list showing 'abcdef abcwxyz', AND
the
completion to 'abc'.

So i could immediately understand it was a good start, but i
needed to
complete the words.

- now i have zsh v3.1.5 on some machines of my lab.
In the same 'setopt' and file existence conditions,
'ls ab' + tab ONLY complete to abc. So i can believe that the
completion
is done, and the file actually exists, thus pressing OK, to
understand only then that there were not a unique completion, and abc was
just the start..

Well, i hate this behaviour, so:
- is there some new setopt option i didnt see to have it back as
before ?
- if not, will it be possible in versions to come to get the same
behaviour as before ?


Thanks, and keep working for the best shell..
