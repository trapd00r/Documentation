Unfortunately this doesn't work very well in a case like the one
we have where the interpreter name is strange, since the \r is
interpreted literally and you end up with something like

: no such file or directorybad interpreter: /bin/sh

To fix this properly we need to be able to display two properly formatted
strings in an error message: it's many, many years past the point where
error messages should have used variable-length argument lists.  This would
be a nice, self-contained project for someone; we can probably assume
stdarg is available now (since we seem to assume a lot of ISO C elsewhere).

Until someone fixes that, the less bad alternative is probably to assume
that the interpreter name is more likely to need special handling than the
script name.

I note that nicechar() and wcs_nicechar() print \n as \n, but \r as ^M.
This isn't too bad, but it's a little inconsistent.  We should probably
handle at least the standard C codes, unless anyone can see why we
shouldn't.  Anyway, until then, you get things like

zsh: /home/pws/tmp/noexec: bad interpreter: /bin/sh^M: no such file or
directory

(wrapped the line myself to avoid giving the pleasure to our mail
software).
