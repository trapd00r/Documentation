Well, the only thing it does  is to put termcap first in library search
order:

[case "$host_os" in
  hpux10.*|hpux11.*|solaris*)
      termcap_curses_order=3D"curses ncurses termcap" ;;
  *)             termcap_curses_order=3D"termcap curses ncurses" ;;
esac])dnl


Now we may not have libtermcap installed (is it possible?) or logic in
termcap.c still selects USES_TERM_H. I must admit I never fully
understood the logic that have been used to select between them.
