That's fine...  I'm expecting that there'll be #ifdef's in the code;
probably the messier part is working out where to put your non-standard
build code.  Ideally, it would be good (both for you to maintain it and
for us not to mess it up) if this could live in a subdirectory, but
Makefile-style files in the source directories aren't a problem.  I think
the major limitation is that we'll have to be careful that the distribution
doesn't come with files that normally get autogenerated.  (I'm not familiar
with Symbian myself.)

Don't really like this one, I think that's likely to be too much effort to
keep going.  I would hope that enough little tweaks could be made by the
Symbian developers to keep the normal code aligned.  The fundamentals of
zsh (OS-related parts) don't tend to change that much.

This is certainly no problem, but it would be worth at least exploring a
better integration.
