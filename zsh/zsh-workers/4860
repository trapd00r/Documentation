Shouldn't do.  Knuth designed TeX to be completely platform independent.
He raised hell when someone changed one of the fonts and the changes
made their way into several GNU/Linux distributiions -- a character
width change meant the results were different.

Of course, it /could/ be that the NT porters fiddled about.  *shrugs*
