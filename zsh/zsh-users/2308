Subject: need completion help....


*sigh*

I don't understand completion at all.

Here's what I need.  I need completions for a command "mva"

mva will move files from the directory $asub

	BUT it needs to ignore any files which begin with
		the letters "README" (all in capitals, may not be
		any more letters than just "README" or can be
		any length after that
	   AND files named 'files.html' and 'index'		

Here's the folder's current contents:

# ls $asub
README@
README-Naming-MacOS-X-Submissions
README_How-to-Write-a-Good-README
README_Understanding-How-Files-are-Named
files.html
index
squid-2.1.PATCH2-P-b.gnutar.gz
squid-2.1.PATCH2-P-s.gnutar.gz
squid-2.1.PATCH2.README
ssh-2.0.12-P-b.gnutar.gz
ssh-2.0.12-P-s.gnutar.gz
ssh-2.0.12.README

In this example, the squid? files and the ssh? files are the only ones I  
would want completions for when I do:

	mva [tabhere]

can someone help me out?  I've looked over tons of examples, but I just get  
more and more confused.
