I normally prefer flat directory structures but in this case: yes,
sounds good.

Hm, if the final version still looks the same we could also think
about Core/Main (_main_complete, _tags and friends), Core/Completer,
Core/Utility (for things like _arguments), Core/Foo (can't think of a
name; for _pids, _hosts, ...).

There are now already 245 completion functions. Whew.

Bye
