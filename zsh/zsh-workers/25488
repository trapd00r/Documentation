Complete revs and files after `git bisect start`.

I'm using _files here since the bisection works across a range of commits
that might have different paths in them anyway, and I think gathering
all paths across the whole range is just masochistic and very slow,
so might as well use the ones from the working dir.

The -- is optional so technically the second _arguments could have an
_alternative that also adds _files, but I think that would just make
the completion messier for little value.
