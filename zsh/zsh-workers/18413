Since (( is not permitted to be a reserved word, a conforming shell
*cannot* treat it as such. Among other things, if there is an executable
file named (( anywhere in $PATH, then

     while (( $count < $NUMLOOPS ))

is required to invoke that executable program rather than any
functionality built into the shell.
