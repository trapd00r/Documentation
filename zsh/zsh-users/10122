I don't know the answer but I have a similar usage problem: keep only
the interesting lines in history. As a workaround I do the following:
- set the the following options
  histignorealldups
  histignorespace
  histnostore

- define several aliases of the form ls=' ls', free=' free', etc to
  avoid having them go to the hist file and running zsh list.

I also type most of the easy commands beginning with a space for the
same reason.

Me too! I recognize however that a developer might find this hmm...
not of particularly high priority...
