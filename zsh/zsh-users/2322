autoparamslash behavior was broken some time ago, but should be fixed
by patch 6077 (a reply from me to one of your messages). This is in
pws-1[67] so either you are using an older version or there is
something going on I don't understand. Maybe the thing Larry mentioned 
(directory must exist and be accessible)? Or lapps not really set?
(Sorry, I'm just guessing.)

Bye
 Sven
