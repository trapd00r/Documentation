Ok, after reading your documentation changes and tinkering a bit my
self I think I've gotten a grasp on cdpath.

It seems to me that having another directory in cdpath before . would
be quite unusual, and that was the one case when cd to the empty
string was even remotely useful. I don't think that motivates not
complaining about an argument that you can't stat(2), but I can't
think of anything but subjective reasons any more though. :|
