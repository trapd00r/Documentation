Ths is odd.  I was using accept-and-menu-complete to add file names to the
command line, and when the line wrapped (thus causing the listing to be
redraw one line farther down) the `B' in `Builtins' vanished.

I've inserted the line break at column 80 in the cut'n'paste output below,
to show where the wraparound happened.  I don't actually know for sure if
the B vanished as soon as the line wrapped or not until Src/builtin.c was
completed.  My xterm does have auto-wraparound enabled.
