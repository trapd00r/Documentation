Hi,
is that work still needed ?
I have free time in the next few days, and I'll be happy to spend it
helping zsh. I don't feel really confident in my knowledge of zsh, and
of zsh release process, but as you claim anyone on the list could help,
I still offer to spend some time for that :)

I don't known if I have the time and/or capacity to do port all the
patches (furthermore, I have no idea what amount of work it is), but
tell me if even part of that work would be useful.

In case my help is accepted, it would be nice if I am explained the
whole procedure in details, and if someone checks (at least in the
beginning), that I don't do too many mistakes.

arno.
