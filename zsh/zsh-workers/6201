Yes, I had thought about this, too, and than forgot to mention
it. There are other things I forgot to mention:

  - we could, of course, add some more of these: aliases, bindkeys,
    compctls (a problem with the first two are the different types:
    normal/global and widgets/string)
  - as you might have seen, I haven't changed anything to use this,
    but the example completion code could use `$commands' to get rid
    of the `$(whence -p ...)', it could use `$parameters' in
    `_parameters' and probably other things I currently can't think
    of.

The only support needed in the core is to be able to give special scan 
functions.

Bye
 Sven
