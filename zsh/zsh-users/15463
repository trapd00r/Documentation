There is a problem with some of the parsing at present, don't have time
to fix myself but I'll note it here.

{ screen -dr } is handled as any-sessions, but that's just option
bundling. { screen -d -r } is matching on detached-sessions, but should
be any-sessions.  The earlier -d is not changing the state, it's just an
assumption of bundling.

On a related note, "-x" is shown as taking attached-sessions.  In fact,
-x is a parameterless option, simply turning on multi-display mode
(multiple clients all connected to the same screen session, possibly on
different windows, but not necessary).  So { -x -r }, { -xr }, whatever,
they should all take any-sessions.

So if someone new to completion is encountering issues and wants to
explore, this is a good candidate to tackle, as you'd get to redo the
approach, not merely add or remove a line.

-Phil
