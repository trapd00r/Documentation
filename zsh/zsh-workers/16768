Subject: 4.1.0-dev-4
Date: Tue, 05 Mar 2002 18:56:12 +0000
Message-ID: <25055.1015354572@csr.com>
From: Peter Stephenson <pws@csr.com>

I've uploaded 4.1.0-dev-4 to

ftp://ftp.zsh.org/pub/development/zsh-4.1.0-dev-4.tar.gz
ftp://ftp.zsh.org/pub/development/zsh-4.1.0-dev-4.tar.bz2

which should be identical to the version in the archive tagged as
zsh-4_1_0-dev-4.

Mostly this is to change the version number so I can use is-at-least to
load the new features.

Most of the changes are once again new and improved forms of
completion, including better completion for parameter values and
redirections.

Other things I can see, glancing at Changelog:

The new (#q) globbing flag for glob qualifiers --- doesn't depend on
bareglobqual, just extendedglob, can be concatenated, and will be
ignored by non-glob pattern matches.  Not yet used extensively (if at
all) by the completion system but probably could be.

Improved handling of resized history entries.

Enhanced insert-last-word and function widget copy-earlier-word which
uses it, an all-singing, all dancing drop-in replacement binding for
`\e='.
