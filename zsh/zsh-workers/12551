} Unless it's me,
}   rm \#<TAB>
} isn't working at the moment, although
}   rm '#<TAB>
} is.

This looks to be a problem with _expand.  Using _expand:

zagzig[234] rm \#<TAB>
zagzig[234] rm \\#
Completing all expansions
\\# 
Completing original
\# 

Without _expand:

zagzig[244] rm \#<TAB>
zagzig[244] rm \#xxx\#

}   rm #<TAB>
} doesn't work either

That one, however, works for me, both with and without _expand:

zagzig[234] rm #<TAB>
zagzig[234] rm \#xxx\#

zagzig[244] rm #<TAB>
zagzig[244] rm \#xxx\#
