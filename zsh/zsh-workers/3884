Sorry to follow up my own email (though I realize my sig needed to be updated).
Am just trying to patch in the old behaviour, and realizing it's quite involved -
ZLE_HISTSEARCH has been excised, and histpos is no longer a static variable,
so there's no record of how far through a word the search should be keyed from.

I'm willing to write a patch to add this all back again if it would help, but
there's not much point unless there's a desire to maintain this functionality.
Why was it so totally removed?
