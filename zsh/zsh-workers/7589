Subject: Change of behaviour in history-search-backward ?

In 3.1.5 (the only old version I have here), "history-search-backward" was
looking for the largest pattern but it has changed in 3.1.6 (I don't know
when) and now, it is only looking for the first word.

More details:

Giving the following history:

  389  mutt -f +lists/zsh-workers
  390  mutt -f +sent
  391  trn
  392  trn fr.comp.securite
  393  vi PKN
  394  cd src/perl
  395  ll
  396  gen-ncm PKN
  397  echo $ZSH_VERSION
  398  history|more
  399  mutt

In 3.1.5, doing

mutt -f<ESC>p

gives me

mutt -f +sent

In 3.1.6, it gives me 

mutt

Why was that changed and could we go back to the old and expected behaviour?
