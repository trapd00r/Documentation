It's actually my first day with new completion. So far I just try to get the
same environment I had before (with some additional benefits :-)

This is with zsh -f:

itsrm2% l {Commands/ESC-RETURN
Commands/  Core/
itsrm2% l {Commands/,Core/
Commands/  Core/

The slash is removed if I type anything but not with
accept-and-menu-complete.

cheers
