Building RPM for Madriva (glibc 2.4/gcc 4.1.2) there are tons of

builtin.c: In function ‘bin_cd’:
builtin.c:796: warning: ignoring return value of ‘chdir’, declared with 
attribute warn_unused_result
builtin.c:803: warning: ignoring return value of ‘chdir’, declared with 
attribute warn_unused_result
builtin.c: In function ‘bin_print’:
builtin.c:3690: warning: ignoring return value of ‘fwrite’, declared with 
attribute warn_unused_result
builtin.c:3701: warning: ignoring return value of ‘fwrite’, declared with

attribute warn_unused_result
builtin.c: In function ‘bin_read’:
builtin.c:4922: warning: ignoring return value of ‘fwrite’, declared with 
attribute warn_unused_result

etc.

I am not sure if sensible check of return values is possible in every case 
thoigh (i.e. - action if check fails).
