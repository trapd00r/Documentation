Subject: PATCH: texi2info for 4.0
Date: Wed, 24 Oct 2001 12:40:56 +0100
Message-ID: <18071.1003923656@csr.com>
From: Peter Stephenson <pws@csr.com>

I propose to apply the following change, of which the major chunk (the
second is) already on 4.1, to 4.0, since it's required by the version of
texi2html I'm actually using to create the documentation package via `make
everything' --- having anything else in the Makefile is plain silly.  The
HTML output from this actually looks quite good.  I will apply the
manual.yo chunk to 4.1.

Otherwise I think everything for 4.0.3 is about ready.
