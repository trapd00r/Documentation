Hello; back from my vacation now and buried under Sven and Peter's latest

Um, yes.  The reason it sets errflag and done is to force it to leave
the PS2 prompt and go back to PS1.  If you don't set both, it doesn't
work.  The only other way to do it would be to add another new global,
set it in pushlineoredit(), and test it at several spots where `errflag'
and `done' are tested.  It wasn't worth messing with that back when I
originally implemented pushlineoredit(), but maybe it is now.
