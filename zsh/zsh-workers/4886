Yep. As I said, these parameters may change anyway (esp. if we put all 
of them into an associative array).

That's (partly) inherited from the current completion code. One
difference is that math and subscript are distinguished, the normal
code just treats both of them as mathematical environments. I haven't
thought about using multiple context names at once and I could be
convinced to do this for math/subscript and probably others.
But all this is new stuff anyway, the normal completion code doesn't
allow one to separately define completions for conds, math, subscript, 
redir, and value, so I suggest playing with it until we find out what
would be most useful.

Bye
 Sven
