Yes, "pushd/popd" is too specific compared to the the other ones who
are far more general..., but is "DIRS" the appropriate term? "Dealing
somehow with dirs" seems a bit vague to me...

For instance?

Which options for instance?

My fight continues until the last miscellaneous option is categorised
elsewhere... ;-)!
