Hi.

I have a question about job control:
Suppose I have a program running which give me
alot of output. I stop it with C-z.
When I do bg the program starts running in background
again, but I get the output.
Is there a way (like bg sets the &) to specify redirection
of bg-jobs without killing them and reinvoking?
