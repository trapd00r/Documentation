Well, you have to explain where your problem is with that setup...

What that setup does this:

    + Complete until the first non-ambiguous character, if possible.
    + Show a list of possible completions, if there are only ambiguous
      completions left and tab is pressed.
    + If the list from the previous step is being displayed and tab is
      hit again, enter that list as a browsable menu with a cursor you
      can control with the keyboard's cursor keys.

Point one and two sound a *lot* you're asking for. Point three is a
little extra sugar, a lot of people like. You may want the menu to be
shown right away after the first tab when all non-ambiguous characters
have been inserted. If so, that's wasn't entirely clear to me.

But as for "zsh should only complete until the first ambigous
character", that's what that setup does.
