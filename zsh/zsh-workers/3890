I would think that the purpose of the CVS repository would be to be to
store the authentic source as it would appear in the next release.
This would requite that the coordinator keeps it in sync with his
repository.  Unless Zefram does this himself, how can you be sure that
a patch you check in would show up unmodified in the release?

A centralized CVS master site would also allow multiple `maintainers'
who can directly check in changes they make, but this would be a quite
different development model than the current one.
