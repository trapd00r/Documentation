}     So I must use something like:
} 
}     eval printf -- \"Hello\\n\"

Yes, except of course that means something considerably different when
there are spaces or metacharacters in the (no longer double-quoted on
the first parse) string.  More likely you want

	eval printf -- \""Hello\\n"\"

}     I forgot that the double quotes were removed :((( Is there any
} way of seeing how a command line is parsed *just before* being
} executed by the shell?

setopt xtrace

(or the equivalent "set -x").  Note that xtrace in recent versions of
zsh re-quotes the output so that it's suitable for cut-and-paste; old
versions (4.0.x and before) show the fully-unquoted result, but there
it's difficult to see where the shell split strings into words.

So e.g.

zagzig% set -x
zagzig% eval printf -- \""Hello\\n"\"
+Src/zsh:2> eval printf -- '"Hello\n"'
+(eval):1> printf -- 'Hello\n'
Hello
zagzig%
