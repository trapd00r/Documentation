Dear Peter,

thanks for your prompt reply, especially the fignore version
is dead simple.

Only nothing of that worked for me... I have tried both setting
fignore and doing

  zstyle ':completion:*:*:vi(m|):*' ignored-patterns '*.fasl'

(actually the extension is a lower case ".fasl")

Is there something I should check for?

FWIW I have the following lines in my /etc/zsh/zshrc:

---

autoload -U compinit
compinit -C

zstyle ':completion:*' list-colors $LS_COLORS

---

and in my local zshrc, among other probably harmless things:

---

setopt extended_glob
setopt equals
setopt correctall

autoload -U url-quote-magic
zle -N self-insert url-quote-magic

---

  Leslie
