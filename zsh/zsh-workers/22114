That's because of the special handling of ".": if it doesn't occur in
cdpath, it's assumed to occur first.

That's long-standing behaviour, although I think the documentation (for
cd) is a bit screwy...

          Otherwise [if the argument is not -], if a directory named arg
          is not found in the current directory and arg does not begin
          with a slash, search each component of the  shell  parameter
          cdpath.

This isn't actually quite right, since if . is in $cdpath but not at
the start it doesn't search . straight away.  So at least the
description needs improving (this isn't special to a null string).
