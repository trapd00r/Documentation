pfalstad's old introduction to zsh is in very serious need of
updating.  (E.g., in the first section -- globbing -- <> is used for
numerical globbing, but many of the glob qualifiers aren't mentioned.)
This is one of the things that would be good to get done for version
3.

Not a good idea, IMO.  Frames are, by their nature, a proprietary
standard, and the only implementation sucks raw eggs through a very
thin straw.  I see that you've got something checking for Netscape at
the front-end; consequently I can't check how the HTML actually looks
without frames.  (I modified Lynx to send the same User-Agent string as
Netscape -- just how are you identifying it?)  Assuming you didn't put
the filter there just for the fun of it, I must conclude that the
frames data causes problems with standard-conforming viewers.
