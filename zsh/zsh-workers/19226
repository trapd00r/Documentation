I mentioned the same problem last year, Bart responded in  zsh-workers/17641
saying: 

"Part of the problem is that the value of MAXJOBS was established when
each job table entry represented a real unix process.  Now that we make
job table entries for internal shell control structures, we need more
table space.  It still shouldn't need to grow without bound (though I
believe we have other anti-infinite recursion mechanisms in place now)."

I reported that I would double the value of MAXJOBS in my builds, which helped
me.   Though it might be nice to have a more dynamic solution.
