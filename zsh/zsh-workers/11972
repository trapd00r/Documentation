I have uploaded zsh-3.1.9-dev-1.tar.gz to the development directory of the
archive.

As luck would have it, this is quite likely to be more stable than 3.1.9.
There have been no large pieces of new code, but several small fixes in
completion (including menu selection and argument handling as well as
numerous functions), handling of 8-bit characters found on the command
line, MAGICEQUALSUBST and traps.

There is at least one reported configuration glitch on HP-UX 11 still to
sort out.
