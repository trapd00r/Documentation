I use Bash.  I asked this group, because I wanted to know if a cleaner
solution is possible (or easily patchable) than the classic method of
    function test1 () {
	cat >/tmp/test1 <<"EOF"
	#! ...
	...
	EOF
	chmod +x /tmp/test1
	/tmp/test1 "$@"
    }

It's the best I could come up with.  It's okey for now, since most
external programs (ie. awk, python) can take script file.  But, my
search continues...
