It is portable back to 3.0.7 (the oldest zsh I have).  It was just not
included in distributions until 3.1.6.  The function is small; you can
just stick it at the top of your script.

You probably want [[ $MY_REV == 4.<6-> || $MY_REV == <5->* ]] to match
-current systems.  Your code also has the side-effect of setting
LSCOLORS on machines that do not cupport colors at all (like FreeBSD
3.5).
