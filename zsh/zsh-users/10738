I feel very sympathetic to the whole gist of this
message. Not to blame anyone. I think zsh is
amazing. But I too tried my hand at completion and
always get bogged down in details without
accomplishing much.

There's a fairly extensive treatment in
"From bash to zsh". But having read it a few
times, I still feel quite uncomfortable with
"styles", "contexts" and the whole completion
business.
