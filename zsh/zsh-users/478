I considered that the problem was that I had `setopt multios', then I checked
by typing `setopt' and `multios' was NOT on the list, so I figured from that
that I DIDN'T have the multios feature turned on.  Then I tried `setopt
nomultios' as above and it worked.  Why did I have to set that explicitly? 

Thank you very much for your help!
