As a potential source of differences, it might be interesting to see 
what's mounted in the root directory of each machine.  This reminds me of 
Zsh scanning drives under /cygdrive/ when running under Cygwin.

Though I'm not sure how the 'cd ..' plays into it... something relating to 
changes that dealt with current-directory tracking?  (sorry, can't recall 
specifics -- it was on here or zsh-users within the past three months or 
so)

Best,
Ben
