According to the standard:

   LC_COLLATE 
         This variable determines the behaviour of range expressions,
         equivalence classes and multi-character collating elements
         within pattern matching.

Of course the standard also requires POSIX character classes, so instead
of [a-z] you are supposed to use [[:lower:]], but unfortunately the later
is not supported yet.
