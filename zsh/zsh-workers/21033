This looks fishy, but I can't get it to happen.  I can get some weird
and wonderful display effects, but that's not surprising.  Are you able
to create a script including only 7-bit characters that starts from zsh
-f, creates appropriate files (using escapes such as e.g. $'\xe5') that
sets up the shell to show the problem?
