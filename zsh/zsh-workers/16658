It might save us going through the whole discussion again next time
VA's lawyers decide they need to justify their no doubt exorbitant
fees.

Basically, though I don't care whether we move it. I'm not bothered

I meant 3.0.x. If making a release is a hassle, we could put it in CVS,
I could update the script which takes daily snapshots to include 3.0.x
and we could direct anyone wanting to use 3.0 to that. That also solves
the issue of any future patches.

Thanks. I don't really see a need for it to be publicly accessible.
Only if/when we actually need it.
