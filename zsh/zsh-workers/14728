Now with forked CVS we have to decide

- how patches are posted
- how patches are integrated.

Posting - should patches be posted for both stable and development?

Integration - are patch authors responsible for applying them to both
branches? Or we designate some person(s) who will maintain stable version
and integrate patches fron HEAD while other will continue in HEAD as before?
