I still don't follow why (1a) isn't "zsh -i" and (3) "exit".  Why do you
need this all to happen in the same shell?  What's the benefit?

To see why the shell doesn't "just do this", have a look at the script
Util/reporter in the zsh distribution, which has a go at being "run
command to save current state", and notice that with all the possible
different combinations of loadable modules and so on that even those
500-odd lines don't manage to cover everything, by a long shot.
