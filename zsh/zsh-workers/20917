The fix to avoid expanding something like $1 was trivial, so I checked
it in to both the trunk and the patches branch:

--- Completion/Unix/Command/_make	11 Nov 2004 19:05:25 -0000	1.14
+++ Completion/Unix/Command/_make	2 Mar 2005 19:06:23 -0000	1.15
@@ -17,7 +17,7 @@ expandVars() {
 		open='{'
 		close='}'
 		;;
-	    ([[:alnum:]]*)
+	    ([[:alpha:]]*)
 		open=''
 		close=''
 		var=${(s::)var[1]}

This change avoids the infinite recursion cited in Debug bug #295511.
