zmodload -i zsh/parameter
print ${${(z)history[$((HISTCMD-1))]}[-1]}

Adjust the line number as necessary: it's $((HISTCMD-1)) when you're
getting the previous line at the prompt but it depends where you are
relative to the line being updated.  Experiment.

Note that $history is an associative array; you need to get the line
number in the key exactly right.
