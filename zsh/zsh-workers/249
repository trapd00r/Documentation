I had hoped to have a new beta version out before
vacation time, but didn't get finished.  I've put
a good bit of work into it.   I've been cleaning up the
various functions in builtin.c which deal with the various
hash tables.  Since I can never leave things the way they
are, this has lead to me rewriting about 40% of builtin.c
so far.  I've cleaned up the code that scans through the
various tables.  I've also cleaned up the various functions
for printing things such as aliases and shell functions
(no more global variables showflag and showflag2).

I'm aheading out for vacation now and will be back
in a week.  Then I'm finish up beta11.

Later,

rc
