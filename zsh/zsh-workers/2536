I tell the user that path is an array and the real thing is the path
variable.  PATH just tries to represent is as a scalar for compatibility
reasons.

When zsh is called as sh, there is no path just PATH.

And if we modify the behaviour of path we should also modify the other
variables: mailpath, fpath, module_path or any other array/scalar pairs.
But that would just remove functionality with cost of addig extra code.
