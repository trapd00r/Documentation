Of course, the correct solution to this problem (which should have been
obvious anyway) is that these special characters need escaping from the
shell. If you do this then everything works perfectly*. The quote keys etc.
can be programmed to automatically add the escape while entering text into
an sql command and so it is largely transparent anyway - even cutting &
pasting statements in works.

Cheers,

Martin.
