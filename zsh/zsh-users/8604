Hi Phil !

 Thanks a lot for the hint...gives me a whole lotta more of space (new
 lines) for nice zshish code ! :)
 
 Sometimes (often!) just the simple things are makeing life so much
 easier ! ;O)))))))

 Keep zshing!
 Meino

 PS: Just cause I am a little curious... :)
     Under Emacs each keycode is bound to a named function like
	 forward-search-regexp and such...what is the corresponding
	 function in zsh? insert-line ? Or what is its name ?
