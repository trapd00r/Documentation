X-Virus-Scanned: ClamAV 0.92.1/9156/Tue Mar 24 05:11:32 2009 on bifrost
X-Virus-Status: Clean

on linux this works as expected:

     rsync --progress /from /to | while read -d "`print '\r'`" n
     do
         print "  foo: $n"
     done

as rsync uses a carriage return to update the progress of the file 
transfer, the "read" builtin uses '\r' as a delimiter, and prints the 
output as expected, one line at a time.

on freebsd it doesn't work at all. i suspect the bug may be in bsd's 
libraries, because a similar thing happens on linux and fails to happen on 
freebsd with:
     rsync --progress /from /to | tr '\r' '\n'

of course linux is using gnu-tr and freebsd is using bsd-tr.

can anyone help identify the source of the problem, and/or a workaround?

thanks...!
