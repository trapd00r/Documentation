} I switched from old, hardcoded color variables over to the colors function.

Even the colors function is now somewhat out of date for prompts.  The
latest versions of zsh (possibly only the dev version from CVS, I don't
recall and am short of time at the moment to go looking) support color
sequences directly so you don't need the %{ and %} wrappers.  E.g.

PS1='%K{blue}%F{red}RED ON BLUE%f%k%# '
