From: Peter Stephenson <pws@csr.com>

I've uploaded
  ftp://ftp.zsh.org/pub/development/zsh-4.0.1-pre-5.tar.gz
  ftp://ftp.zsh.org/pub/development/zsh-4.0.1-pre-5.tar.bz2

There are no major changes this time, and the configuration problems seem
to have been resolved, so I will probably release 4.0.1 next week if
nothing serious turns up.  If you aren't having any of the problems listed
below, you can probably just wait for the official release.

This isn't quite up to date with the archive, since I prepared it yesterday
when we were having problems with outgoing mail.


2001-05-21  Peter Stephenson  <pws@csr.com>

	* 14408: Test/C02cond.ztst: do chmod +w to work around rm -f
	problem in Cygwin.

	* unposted: Test/.distfiles: add Test/E01options.ztst.

2001-05-20  Peter Stephenson  <pws@pwstephenson.fsnet.co.uk>

	* 14396: Src/params.c, Test/D04paramater.ztst, Doc/Zsh/params.yo:
	Fix bug that though path/PATH etc. were unset as a pair, they
	didn't get recreated as a pair despite remaining special.  Add
	tests for this and fix in 14388.  Add documentation for special
	ties like path and PATH.

2001-05-20  Bart Schaefer  <schaefer@zsh.org>

	* unposted: Test/ztst.zsh: Handle line wrapping in ZTST_hashmark.

2001-05-20  Andrej Borsenkow <bor@zsh.org>

	* 14401: Makefile.in, configure.in, Config/config.mk,
	Config/installfns.sh, Doc/Makefile.in, Src/Makefile.in,
	Src/mkmakemod.sh: do not assume scripts are directly executable
	(they are not always on Cygwin) - use `sh script' instead

2001-05-20  Wayne Davison  <wayned@users.sourceforge.net>

	* last half of 14390: Src/params.c: Added some boundary checks
	to the array-assignment code.

2001-05-19  Wayne Davison  <wayned@users.sourceforge.net>

	* 14389: Src/hashtable.c, Src/hist.c: Don't call addhistnode()
	or removehashnode() on a HIST_TMPSTORE entry.  Don't merge a
	HIST_TMPSTORE entry with a previous "duplicate" line.

2001-05-18  Bart Schaefer  <schaefer@zsh.org>

	* 14388: Src/params.c, Src/subst.c: Correctly handle re-set of
	of integer-typed special parameters such as SHLVL, after unset.

	* 14385: Test/V01zmodload.ztst, Test/ztst.zsh: Fix typo in a
	comment; print a warning when unable to test zsh/example; make
	sure the file descriptor for that warning (and others in other
	test files) is available even if ZTST_verbose has an unexpected
	value.

2001-05-18  Peter Stephenson  <pws@csr.com>

	* not posted: Test/ztst.zsh, Test/E01options.ztst: added some more
	options; made ztst.zsh more robust about ksharrays being set by
	a test.

	* 14382: Src/module.c: zmodload -uf wouldn't work even if the
	math function hadn't been loaded yet.

2001-05-18  Sven Wischnowsky  <wischnow@zsh.org>

	* 14381: Src/subst.c: try to make ${(e)..} work for complicated
	parameter expansions in the value; this means: keep Qstring
	tokens unchanged if they are inside double quotes and
	tokenizing patterns in parameter expansions

2001-05-18  Bart Schaefer  <schaefer@zsh.org>

	* unposted: Test/.distfiles, Test/V01zmodload.ztst: Add the basic
	tests of zmodload functionality.

2001-05-18  Clint Adams  <clint@zsh.org>

	* 14378: Completion/Unix/Type/_tex: also work for
	pdflatex, jadetex, and pdfjadetex.

2001-05-17  Tanaka Akira  <akr@zsh.org>

	* 14377: Completion/Unix/Command/_cvs: support new .cvspass format

2001-05-17  Peter Stephenson  <pws@csr.com>

	* 14376: Completion/Unix/Command/_lp: type with compset.

2001-05-17  Bart Schaefer  <schaefer@zsh.org>

	* 14375: Src/Zle/zle_main.c: Permit signals to be handled during
	read from the terminal in zleread().  (This changes only nested
	calls from widgets such as incremental search; signals were never
	queued for top-level reads.)

2001-05-16  Clint Adams  <clint@zsh.org>

	* 14361, 14362: Completion/Unix/Command/_modutils: use
	state for modprobe so that modprobe -r will
	complete multiple loaded modules.  Also
	handle more of modprobe's options.

2001-05-16  Sven Wischnowsky  <wischnow@zsh.org>

	* 14359: Src/Zle/zle_tricky.c: more fixage for expansion: just
	convert the command line to the original when expansion
	shouldn't or couldn't do something sensible on the line

2001-05-15  Wayne Davison  <wayned@users.sourceforge.net>

	* 14357: Src/hashtable.c, Src/hist.c, Src/zsh.h, Doc/Zsh/options.yo:
	Added a "delayed drop" for ignored history entries.

2001-05-15  Oliver Kiddle  <opk@zsh.org>

	* 14355: Completion/Unix/Command/_modutils: fix bug where /sbin/lsmod
	was redirected in instead of being run

2001-05-15  Sven Wischnowsky  <wischnow@zsh.org>

	* 14350: Completion/Base/Completer/_expand, Src/Zle/zle_tricky.c:
	don't remove single and double quotes that are inside parameter
	expansions; hopefully better handling of brace expansions in
	_expand

2001-05-15  Peter Stephenson  <pws@csr.com>

	* 14348: Src/builtin.c: some idiot forgot to make GLOBAL_EXPORT
	work with typeset -g.

2001-05-15  Sven Wischnowsky  <wischnow@zsh.org>

	* 14346: Src/parse.c: calculate the length of the region to map
	(for mapped zwc files) correctly, including the
	offset-page-boundary-adjustment

2001-05-15  Clint Adams  <clint@zsh.org>

	* 14341: Completion/Unix/Command/.distfiles,
	Completion/Unix/Command/_modutils:
	complete loaded Linux kernel modules for
	rmmod or modprobe -r.

2001-05-14  Peter Stephenson  <pws@csr.com>

	* 14330: Completion/Base/Widget/_most_recent_file: handle filenames
	which need quoted characters better.

2001-05-14  Sven Wischnowsky  <wischnow@zsh.org>

	* 14327: Src/exec.c: set list_pipe_job only for real pipelines

2001-05-11  Peter Stephenson  <pws@csr.com>

	* 14314: Src/Modules/stat.c: writing const variable under cygwin.

	* 14313: Test/E01options.ztst, Test/ztst.zsh: new options tests.

2001-05-10  Wayne Davison  <wayned@users.sourceforge.net>

	* 14304: Src/hist.c: Fixed an obscure local-history bug that could
	make the "history" command output something that was slightly wrong.

2001-05-10  Andrej Borsenkow <bor@zsh.org>

	* users/3872: Src/Modules/zftp.c: rename inet_* to avoid clash
	with Solaris 7 headers.

2001-05-10  Tanaka Akira  <akr@zsh.org>

	* 14295: Completion/Unix/Command/_cvs: support new cvs subcommands
	`rannotate' and `rlog' introduced by cvs-1.11.1.

2001-05-10  Sven Wischnowsky  <wischnow@zsh.org>

	* 14293: Src/Zle/computil.c: barf if a empty string is given as
	one of the separators for _values

2001-05-09  Bart Schaefer  <schaefer@zsh.org>

	* unposted: configure.in: Clean up 14275+14290 a bit at Andrej's
	urging so as not to violate quite so many autoconf usage rules.

	* 14290: configure.in: Use a different cache variable for the
	Solaris-curses.h-mistake-fix from 14275.

2001-05-09  Oliver Kiddle  <opk@zsh.org>

	* 14266, 14283: Etc/FEATURES, StartupFiles/zshrc: update; in

	operators when expanding after a redirection operator.
