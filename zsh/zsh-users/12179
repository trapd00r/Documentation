} Nice! I've had that loop in there for years! Thanks :)

Note that older versions of zsh don't handle glob qualifiers properly if
there are no other globbing characters in the pattern ... so if you use
the same configuration on various hosts, some of which are not up to
date, it may be worth keeping the loop.
