"It's always been that way."

I think it's probably because there's no separate option for
notification when at the command line as opposed to when running a
command, so if you turn off NOTIFY you don't get the message until you
hit return in any case --- even if all that would happen is that the
command line would be redrawn, which is a much more benign effect than
writing over the programme's output.  It ought to be straightforward to
provide ZLE_NOTIFY, I would think.
