    Obvious, gdb gets it as just ONE argument ;)

    Try this:

    gdb --args myprog arg1 arg2 arg3

    (if you don't use a core argument, of course)

    BTW, the widget is quite useful, not only for gdb, but for other
interactive programs too where you ALWAYS run certain command at
startup. Thanks :))
