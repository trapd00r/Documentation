Has there ever been a completion function for cardctl? While its options
are hardly that long or hard to remember, I guess I've just been spoiled
by zsh :) 

The same goes for some of the targets of the Linux kernel: menuconfig,
xconfig and gconfig exist as targets but they can't be completed. There
are others too.
