Hello
 	I'm trying to obtain random numbers from my own distribution and 
I'd like to wrap all the arithmetic in ZSH functions which query $RANDOM 
or rand48().  However, I keep getting the same numbers over and over 
again.  I can avoid this by querying $RANDOM in the parent routines but 
I'd like to encapsulate everything in the subroutines.
 	I'm thinking of saving the result of the last $RANDOM value in a 
global variable R and then seeding RANDOM=$R at each invocation.  Will 
this result in an equivalent quality of randomness?
 	Are there any other solutions?
 	Thanks
