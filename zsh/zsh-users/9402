Yes, except that the "commands" are embedded in the same stream as the
ordinary non-command data.  It's more like a very crude form of markup.
In HTML, you'd write
    I am not bold but <bold>I am brave!</bold>
and in "terminal markup" you'd write
    I am not bold but ^[[01;39mI am brave!^[[00m
(where ^[ is the ESC character).  In neither case do you see the markup
when the text is displayed (hence, no cursor movement).

No, nothing like that.  I'm only talking about humans misunderstanding
the confusing terminology, not zsh misinterpreting the strings.  Look
at what I was just saying about markup ... prompts have "markup" too:

    I am not bold but %BI am brave!%b

Prompt markup can't change colors, though, so sometimes you have to mix
terminal markup and prompt markup.  The prompt markup %{ and %} tell zsh
that what's in between is some other kind of markup, so that it should
not count it as something that occupies space on the display.

}   URKS!

Yeah, but that's why I said "in the worst case."

} Setting PS1 directly without the addtional step using $prompt it does
} not work.

That makes no sense at all.  Something is happening that you don't know
how to tell us, and I don't know what to ask to learn what it is.

However ...

} I am happy haveing a colored prompt

... if you're happy, we don't need to pursue it any further right now.

} ... only wihing that sometimes
} zshall would be more understandable than totally complete.

Wishing?  Buy Oliver and Peter's book!
