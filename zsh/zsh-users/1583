I have been using zsh on WinNT for about 6 weeks now. So far I love it,
but I have two small problems that maybe someone could help me with:

1. When using the read I get no echo of the characters typed in.
   Is there a way to get the characters echoed as they are typed?

2. When running awk/gawk double quotes inside a single quoted script get
removed
   unless quoted with backslash. I am trying to write code for both WinNT and 
   UNIX, \" does not work on UNIX and " does not work for WinNT.

   NT Example:
    gawk '{ printf ("test %s\n", $1) }'         # this works on UNIX
    c:\bin\gawk: cmd. line:1: { printf (test %s\n, $1) }
    c:\bin\gawk: cmd. line:1:           ^ parse error

   UNIX Example:
    gawk '{ printf (\"test %s\n\", $1) }'       # this works on NT
    gawk: cmd. line:1: { printf (\"test %s\n\", $1) }
    gawk: cmd. line:1:           ^ backslash not last character on line

   Is there a syntax that will work on both systems?

Thanx for any hints.
