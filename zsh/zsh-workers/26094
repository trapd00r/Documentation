Hello,

I've try to port zsh to os2 and it fails with the "make"

I use Gcc v4.32

utils.c: In function 'adjustwinsize':
utils.c:1537: error: 'struct ttyinfo' has no member named 'winsize'
utils.c:1538: error: 'struct ttyinfo' has no member named 'winsize'
make.exe[2]: *** [utils.o] Error 1
make.exe[2]: Leaving directory `U:/zsh-4.3.9/Src'
make.exe[1]: *** [modobjs] Error 2
make.exe[1]: Leaving directory `U:/zsh-4.3.9/Src'
make.exe: *** [all] Error 1
Any thoughts ?
