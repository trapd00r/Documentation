Though I'm not a developer, I can't help but reply to this.   I've
used many linux distributions, and have built linux from scratch
(linuxfromscratch.org). I've also used FreeBSD and OpenBSD, and OS X.=20
Each comes with it's own set of defaults (apart from LFS which has no
default zsh config, due to it's being built directly from source).=20
Most programs leave any customization to the end user.  If you use zsh
with any of the above mentioned OSes you'll find a slightly different
set of defaults.

I would prefer, as an end user, that the developers focus their
efforts on producing the best possible shell, and leave the
customization to us.
