In the first case, cfp_bld_pats(), it's compiling a list of matched
files (presumably in a given directory, but that's a guess) to return
from the array pats.  It's skipping those files to which the
NO_GLOB_DOTS test applies.  At what stage this function is called is
another matter.

The second case, cfp_add_sdirs(), is more obscure, but evidentally sdirs
has come down from the special-dirs style so the code is related to that.
