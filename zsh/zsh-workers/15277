One real bug turned up here, at least.  This is after removing that patch.

% foo='where i walked lizards wandered here and there around'
% print ${(S)foo%%(#b)(h*e)} 
where i walked lizards wandered here and t around
% print ${foo[$mbegin,$mend]}
ere 
% print $mbegin
-10
% print $mend
-7

Those should always be positive; the fact they appear close to correct when
counting backwards is a coincidence.
