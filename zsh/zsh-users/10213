That's only part of the answer -- as I read it, Eric also wants the
parens to be discarded so that "dial" sees only digits.

The only reasonable way to accomplish that is to create a wrapper
script or function around "dial".  If "dial" is itself a script, it
might be more appropriate to change that script so that it discards
the parens itself, in which case Frank's answer would finish the job.

A wrapper function might look like

  # Use the "function" keyword to avoid conflicts with aliases
  function dial {
    # Strip non-numerics that commonly appear in phone numbers
    command dial "${@//[-+.()]/}"
  }
  alias dial='noglob dial'
