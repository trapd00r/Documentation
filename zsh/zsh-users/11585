It's a tag, so it should be all-files.

That's possible.  You can restrict it on the command line, too; I
sometimes type "*(.)" and complete that.

"*(-^/)" or "*(-/)" should do the trick.  I've had funny results with
non-existent targets when doing this on the command line.

I've wondered for quite a long time why that's not the default since the
times when you want to identify symbolic links themselves are limited.  I
wonder if it's time for another option?  What would it do, make it so
that both (/) and (-/) followed symbolic links but (--/) didn't?
