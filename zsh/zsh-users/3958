If you read the docs on command substitution, you'll see that

	If  the  substitution  is  not
	enclosed in double quotes, the output is
	broken into words using the IFS parameter.


I think that the following accomplishes what you want, except for checking
if the file is ASCII.

mailpath=(${(f)"$(for i in $HOME/{Mail,savenews}/[^.]*(.rNL+0) ; print $i\?New mail in ${i:t})"})
