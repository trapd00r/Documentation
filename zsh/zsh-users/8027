As I've said, I am aware that the root of my problems seems to be a design
decision incompatible with my work habits.

I can tell you. It doesn't solve my original problem, which is that

BLA=/usr:/us<COMPLETE>

that either. bash does, though and I've grown used to this feature and
don't want to miss it.
