That might be worth a special case, since the assumption is usually that
=cmd returns a file.

However, `=' doesn't always return a file in any case, since it expands
aliases.  That tends to annoy me since it means the behaviour is not well
defined.  What's more, it seems to try the command path first, then expand
aliases, which is not the usual search order; and it never searches for
functions.  So this seems to me more confusing than useful.
