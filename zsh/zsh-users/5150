Greetings from wits end! :-)

I've spent two hours in the manual page, the example .zshrc and the FAQ
and still can't get completion to ignore CVS directories with zsh-4.0.4.

I can get _files_ called CVS ignored, but not _directories_.

How can I set things up so that directories called CVS are ignored in
_all_ completion (not just for a given command)?

At this point, any help would be greatly appreciated. :-)

Ciao,
Sheldon.

PS: The transition from bash2 was really painless.  I just had to add a
    few autoloadables for bash readline compatibility and hey presto!
    The bash readline compatibility stuff is available at:

PPS: The bck-i-search implementation rocks!
