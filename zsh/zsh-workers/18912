Hi all ;),

I've found a strange behavior when using non-ascii characters in a file
name with zsh. I created a file with characters extracted from a utf8-encoded
file as a name (the file is attached with this mail).

When zsh does filename generation, with the file attached for example: 'cp
00* anotherfile', the characters are correctly interpreted, but the problem
arises when using completion. It seems that after using tab-completion and
choosing a file, the characters are modified in some way (i don't know very
much about how the completion module works), and the filename is different
from the real one, so any operation in the filesystem wiht the name that
zsh provides, fails.

Thanks
