Indeed; thanks.  I've also added the optional number 1 to -P, which means
that it'll prevent you from trying to put a second comma on there and
continue completing.

There's an ordering to the arguments of keysource, but not to the list of
things that keysource is in.  So we could have

    foo=64,bar,keysource=passphrase,prompt,baz=true

or
    foo=64,keysource=passphrase,prompt,bar,baz=true

etc.  I want to complete the two comma-separated values after keysource=
with my function, but everything else in this list would be handled
naturally by _values, as if keysource took only a single argument.
