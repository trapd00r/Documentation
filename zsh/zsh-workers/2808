The only change I made was that substitution of TCCLEAREOL for TCCLEAREOD in  
zle_refresh to workaround a bug in the scroll bar when a shell is opened.  Then I  
tried to compile it and I ran into some problems in the link phase:

/bin/ld: warning /usr/lib/libtermcap.a(termcap.o) has external relocation entries  
in non-writable section (__TEXT,__text) for symbols:
_strcpy
_write
_strlen
_close
_read
_open
_getenv
__ctype_
/bin/ld: warning /usr/lib/libtermcap.a(tgoto.o) has external relocation entries in  
non-writable section (__TEXT,__text) for symbols:
_strcpy
_strcat
/bin/ld: warning /usr/lib/libtermcap.a(tputs.o) has external relocation entries in  
non-writable section (__TEXT,__text) for symbols:
__ctype_

Seen anything like this before?  I haven't yet done the regression test of seeing  
if the problems go away if I change the TCCLEAREOL back to TCCLEAREOD.  Are the  
above messages an indication of serious problems?

Thanks for any help you can give.
