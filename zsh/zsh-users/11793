} Is it possible to solve this problem?

The short answer to this is "no."

The long answer is that in general the shell doesn't have any idea what
(or if any) output a given command produces.  For external commands,
the shell completely surrenders control of the terminal and waits for
the command to finish; it can't tell what happens to the display in
the interim.
