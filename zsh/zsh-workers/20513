This is because of a feature I've never understood whereby zero-length
metafied strings are turned into a Nularg token plus the usual NULL.  I
didn't handle this properly.

This also makes sure that a zero-length string in a pattern is optimised
to be recognised as a pure string, for which memcmp rather than the full
pattern matcher can be used.  (Hmm, I hope memcmp'ing zero bytes is
portable.)
