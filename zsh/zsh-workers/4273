I tried the big completion patch, but I had 1700 rejected lines in
zle_tricky.c, probably because of my completion widget patch (revised),
so it doesn't look like I'm going to be able to test it any time soon.

By the way, I had another message today asking about ignoring case
during completion.  It's time this was sorted out.  Is there a patch
for this (and nothing else) at the moment?
