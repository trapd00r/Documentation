Yes, I _do_ remember this one ;-) Though I'm using a DEC VT510 ;-)

As I'm also running Debian unstable (aka sid), my line in /etc/inittab
may be of help. Here it is:

T1:23:respawn:/sbin/getty -L ttyS1 38400 vt510
#                                  ^^^^^ ^^^^^- you should change this
#                                  |||||        to "vt220"
#                                  +++++------- the line speed. 9600
#                                               or 19200 may also be
#                                               values you should try
#                                               out if you run into
#                                               problems

CU,
Thomas
