must've been late yesterday, afterall:

it worked in bash, because at some point in time a had already configured=20
my .inputrc to ignore that strange sequence \e[25;2~ by binding it to=20
something that obviusly seems to produce no tty output, like this:

"\e[25;2~": capitalize-word

now, trying the same in .zshrc using:

bindkey "^[[25;2~" capitalize-word

helps, and pressing shift + pageup now behaves normally...
still, this seems like a work aroung, which doesn't solve the real problem.=
=2E.
