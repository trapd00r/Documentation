As sleep is an external command rather than a builtin (cf. zselect), this 
forces zsh to perform a wait() system call [more or less], which in turn 
forces the scheduler to let the sleep run to completion before zsh wakes 
up again.  That it's specifically "sleep 0" is probably irrelevant; any 
external command is likely to have the same effect.
