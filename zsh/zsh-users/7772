One tip the casual zsh user may not be aware of is the functions listed
in the zshcontrib manual page.  There are quite a lot of nifty add-ons.
4.2.0 added a system for handling suffixes by MIME type, for example
(you just type the file name).  Somebody already mentioned zargs which
is documented there.
