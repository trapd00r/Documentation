Heyla,
 sorry, I haven't had much time up until now.  I'm going to have to look at
the way 3.1.* handles the Zle module before I can send a patch for all the
problems - previously I've been sending patches to 3.0.*
The reason that the zle went into singlelinemode style when the terminal
went down to 1 or 2 lines is because it was simpler.  I seem to remember, it
avoided *lots* of conditionals all the way through the code.  I can change
this and I would also probably have to change quite a bit of the prompt code
to count number of lines, etc.

There are a couple of choices here; when a terminal decreases number of
lines to 1 or 2:
 1)  it goes into singlelinemode style (without setting SINGLE_LINE_ZLE)
     until the terminal increases its lines above 2.  
 2)  it acts as it did previously - however the mini-buffer won't be available.
     Also, only the last line of the prompt would be printed.  To print the
     last two lines would require another variable for the prompt - is it
     worth it?

The first was the current choice - my opinion on this was people shrinking
their terminal down that much don't seriously use it like this.  Anyone
seriously use a (x-)terminal at 1 or 2 lines?

There are also a couple of bugs which won't show up until the terminal goes
down to < 5 or so columns.  I think I kept getting destroyed memory structs
so I didn't work out what buffers were being overflowed.
I'll go over this (with a fine toothed comb) in a couple of days.
