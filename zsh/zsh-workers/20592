It's expecting a key string and getting just a null string.  I think
that's causing the buffer where the key should be written to be
uninitialised.  Presumably that can have direr effects when the pointer
has to be 64-bit aligned.

The following should trap the error before it gets to that stage.

% print $((##))
zsh: character missing after ##
