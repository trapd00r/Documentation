On Zoltan's recommendation, I upgraded to one of the test releases of
beta11 (test9-hzoli11, in fact).  My problem with the history went
away, but I discovered what seems to be a bug in hash.

I had a command

  hash -d foo /usr/bar/foo

in my .zshrc.  beta11 complains about this, and after I checked the
man page, which says to use an equals sign, I changed it to the
following (which does *not* work with beta10):

  hash -d foo=/usr/bar/foo

On this it doesn't complain, but it doesn't add ~foo into the hash
directory.

I hope this one can get fixed soon.  :)  All your work, Richard, is
much appreciated by myself and my converts.  <grin>

Thanks,
Danek
