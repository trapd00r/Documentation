That's not working right with negative arguments for me - an initial
neg-argument is ignored both in what is displayed, and in the effect
of the eventual argument.

Also, if you use neg-argument after using digit-argument, then the
display gets all screwed up because the prompt incorrectly moves up a
line.

Of course that's a better fix.

That's too bad, as it's what I usually use.  Wonder how hard it'd be
to add this functionality directly to the C code implementing that..

Ha ha, I didn't even know about that!
