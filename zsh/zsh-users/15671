} It's sad that I have to pay the tax for such users.

That you realize it is a tax, makes you the right person to pay it.

Yep.

} This is, speaking as a programmer, perhaps even worse.

Zsh has always been [*] organized such that the stuff that will least
confuse a newbie, or will save the most keystrokes when whipping out
an everyday interactive command line, has the most obvious syntax; and
so the power tools for serious script programmers are concealed behind
syntax that could never occur by accident.

[*] Or tried to be, not always entirely successfully.  The rule that
most often defeats this is that nothing old is allowed to break when
adding something new.
