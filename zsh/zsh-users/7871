That could be more compactly written as

    grow-killring() {
	setopt localoptions noksharrays
	: ${killring[${NUMERIC:-30}]:=''}
    }

Arrays automatically grow to accomodate the largest element into which you 
store a value, even if you don't use the intervening elements.

    zle-line-init() {
	zle grow-killring
	zle -D zle-line-init
    }
    zle -N zle-line-init
