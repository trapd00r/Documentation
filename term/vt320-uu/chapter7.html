<H2 ID="S7.2">Power-Up Self-Test</H2>
<P>Every time you turn the terminal on, the VT320 automatically runs a power-up
self-test. This test checks the operating status of many internal parts in the
terminal. During the test, the keyboard indicators turn on and off, and the bell
tone sounds. If the test is successful, a "VT320 OK" message appears on the
screen.</P>
<H3 ID="S7.2.1">Error Messages</H3>
<P>If the VT320 fails the power-up self-test, the terminal may display one of the
error messages in <A HREF="#T7-2">Table 7-2</A>. Only qualified service personnel should try to
correct these problems. You should note any error message that appears and call
for service.</P>
<P>The keyboard indicator lights may flash in different patterns during the test.
These patterns are codes that provide service personnel with further information
about the terminal's operating condition.</P>
