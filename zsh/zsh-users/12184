===================

would it be reasonable to have an SPPROMPT parameter, or something 
similar, to control what's displayed there? i guess a default would be 
'%S%#%s' but the option would still be useful if it's output could be set 
to ''. IMHO the PROMPT_SP option is nice, and it would be better to turn 
off (or otherwise modify) it's verbose output, rather than turn off the 
option.
