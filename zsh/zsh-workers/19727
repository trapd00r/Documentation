I've renamed the current zsh version to 4.2.0-dev-1: there's no
corresonding release, and no corresponding tag in the archive, it's just
to avoid versions built from CVS clashing with the released version.
Sorry, I should have done this before.

I've also moved the current ChangeLog to ChangeLog-4.1 and started a new
one.
