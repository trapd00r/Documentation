I think you mean:

    file=( X*(Nom[1]) )
    (( $+file )) && PROG_SUCCESS $file || PROG_FAIL

However, that will run PROG_FAIL if PROG_SUCCESS fails, as well as if
there are no matching files.  I don't think you can avoid if/else.

    if (( $+file )); then PROG_SUCCESS $file; else PROG_FAIL; fi

Note that in the event that there are two or more files with the same
time stamp, there's no guarantee which one of them is chosen, and in
fact X*(om[1]) and X*(Om[1]) might both choose the same file.
