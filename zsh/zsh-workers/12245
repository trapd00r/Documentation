Presumably this also implies gcc, which we've already tested for.  I think
-shared is a standard option to gcc, so maybe it's enough always to used
-shared instead of -G in this case only.  I had a vague feeling there were
more gcc-specific tests in configure than there seem to be now, however, so
I'm a little disquieted.
