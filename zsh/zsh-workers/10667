Are you sure they are enabled. zmodload tries to behave consistently so with dynamic modules disabled, zmodload will still list the available modules. Try zmodload zsh/stat - it should fail, then try zmodload zsh/sched and it should succeed.

I actually think that zsh should automatically load any modules which are compiled in such as sched.

I hadn't tried building a static zsh on AIX (3.2.5) for a long time but it still seems to work. In what way is your static zsh broken (or failing to build)?
