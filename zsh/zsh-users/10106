Subject: How can I complete to filenames for GNU man.

The GNU man man page says...

  However, if name contains a slash (/) then man interprets it as a file
  specification, so that you can do man ./foo.5 or even man
  /cd/foo/bar.1.gz.

The built in _man completer completes to file names, but only if the -l
or --local-file options are given, and these options do not exist on my
version of GNU man (1.5k).

How can I modify functions/_man to complete to file names when there is
a '/' in the man page name?
