    While I understand that running such scripts is very unusual, I
think that just segfaulting is not a correct way of dealing with errors.
For example, in my zsh 4.2.6 I get a segfault when trying to complete
very long file names (I reported that, but it's just an example). If I
try to run a script that eats all the memory, the shell will segfault
too. In the second case I'm the culprit, because really the shell is not
intended to do that job; in the first case I'm not guilty, but the shell
behaved the same. Moreover, even in the first case I think that it's
better to abort, that way you can try to reproduce the error in a
non-login shell and get a sensible error message when the shell crashes
instead of just a crash.

    Just my 0.02 euros, and of course I'm not critizising anything since
I'm not the one who has to fix every memory allocation O:)
