} calling run-help for svn or git is often not very helpful.

} Would you include this change?

I don't think there's any reason to give git and/or svn any special
treatment that isn't applied to (say) cvs or apt or yum or ztcp or
zftp or any other command that uses "subcommands".

I also don't think it's the right approach to build special knowledge
into run-help of all possible commands that have subcommands.

If we're going to make a change for this it should be one that can
also be applied to "perl someprog.plx" or "sh yourscript.sh".

So, how about the below (which replaces the patch I sent in 243260).
This looks for a function (or alias or command) named "run-help-$1",
e.g. run-help-git or run-help-svn or run-help-perl or whatever.  If
one is found, it invokes that, otherwise it invokes "man" as always.

Then one can do:

    run-help-svn () {
      local cmd_args
      cmd_args=( ${@:#-*} )
      svn help $cmd_args[1]
    }

And something similar for git.

Of course at this point we ought to add something to the manual (in the
contributions section, perhaps?) about the run-help function and its,
um, helpers.
