Uh oh. Does that mean that you don't get this:

  nslookup [ ARG ... ]
       This wrapper function for the nslookup command requires the
       zsh/zpty +module.  It behaves exactly like the standard nslookup
       except that it provides customizable prompts (including a

The `+' before `module'. That first appeared when Zefram added the
doc-part of the hierarchical-module-name stuff, I think. I complained
at that time (and hence I think it may look like this in other places, 
too). Or is my zsh version here messed up, somehow, and noone else
gets this?
