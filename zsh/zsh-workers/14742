Hi everybody,

when using the following settings

PROMPT='%B^[[31m%n@%m%#^[[30m%b '
RPROMPT='%~'

the rprompt keeps a margin of 8 characters from the right.  This looks
like a bug to me.

I use a Debian testing/unstable system with the latest zsh-4.0.1 deb
package.

Thanks!

PS:  Please cc me since I'm not on the list.
