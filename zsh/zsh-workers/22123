Subject: PATCH: multibyte configuration

This probes for wcswidth() and assumes the value 1 if the function isn't
available, which at least means the code compiles on OpenBSD with
--enable-multibyte, though it still didn't seem to work.

Danek Duvall tried out a simplified test for multibyte handling on
Solaris which wasn't working for me, but it was for him, so I still have
no clue what's happening there.  Any reports of working zsh with
--enable-multibyte (and real multibyte characters, I know that at least
it compiles and runs) on Solaris 8+ would be useful.
