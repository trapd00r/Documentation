The fix is OK, but V01 is going off into a parallel universe; probably an
exec or similar.

../../Test/V01zmodload.ztst: starting.
../../Test/V02zregexparse.ztst: starting.

Try with more detail.

It might be better to shift the messages (apart from the hash printing,
obviously) to runtests.zsh, as well as making failures more obvious, to
fix this.
