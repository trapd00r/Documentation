Subject: builtin setuid and setgid commands
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii" ; format="flowed"

Zshell should have builtins to call the setuid and setgid system calls.

With this feature, one can write a shell script that is executed by 
root but runs as another user.

The usefulness of this feature came up in the context of the 
mysql.server script, which starts/stops the server and is run by root 
at boot time.  It would be nice if the script itself could use a 
setuid command to ensure that it is running as the mysql user.

Thanks

Dave
