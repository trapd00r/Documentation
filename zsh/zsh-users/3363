Dear Zsh Users,

I have been trying to use Zsh now at work but when I changed my shell to be:
/usr/local/bin/zsh and i have a listing of that in my /etc/shells I can't
log on.
I keep getting this wierd message of:

FreeBSD 3.1-RELEASE (TERRA) #7: Mon Jul  3 23:54:10 MDT 2000

                                                         _
*** Please do not disconnect from terra without exiting all programs
    normally.  If you do not use the Quit function of most accounting
    programs (addnew, edituser, etc), they get hung and bog down the
    system.  If you do not see a quit function, try Ctrl-C.  Thanks!

No mail.
: can't open input file:

What does it mean by Input file? Any help would be appreciated?

Brian
