I'm contemplating how to implement two features and they keep seeming
more and more complicated.

The first is POSIX options to the "command" builtin, basically
overloading it with a modified "whence" under EMULATE_SH or
perhaps when POSIX_BUILTINS is set and not otherwise.
It would be easier to differentiate the two meanings into
BINF_COMMAND and something else while parsing, but that doesn't
seem possible without some special handling.

So should BINF_COMMAND check to see if it's followed by
'-p', '-V', or '-v' and then modify its own cflags?

The other is something that will, upon an 'e' response to
sprompt, position the cursor at the point of the potential
error.  How to determine the position, where, and when?
