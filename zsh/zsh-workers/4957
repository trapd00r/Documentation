It includes pretty much everything up to Friday, excluding Sven's last
patch for completion after redirection.  I tested it under AIX 3.2
(dynamic and static) and HPUX 10.20 (dynamic).  (I couldn't try out
configure under the IRIX system at IfH since gcc -g doesn't work any
more there.)

There is one incompatility with previous pws-* versions:  -tc is
neither needed nor allowed with compctl -T.  However, this should make
it actually more compatible with versions up to and including 3.1.5.

Below is the list of patches included.  Beyond that, I made some minor
changes to .cvsdist files to reflect new files (whether they ever get
checked into CVS is another matter, but might as well make it look
right); also, Sven's Src/example for his new completion system has
become Misc/new-completion-examples .

Any word on the problem with dynamic libraries under Digital UNIX?

  pws-5

Name of top level directory is now zsh-3.1.5-pws-5

Missing part of Bart's sethparam() changes, 4851

zftp test subcommand, 4852

Geoff's refresh fix for a line the same length as the terminal width,
4855

Bart's fix for array slices, 4874

Sven's accept-and-menu-complete-fix, 4878

Sven's group completion fix, 4879

Sven's module condition fixes, 4880

Oliver Kiddle's autoconf fix, 4887

My zftp fix (actually due to Andrej Borsenkow) for systems which only
allow dup'ing sockets after they are connected, 4888.

Bart's fix to making setting associative array elements inside
substitutions consistent, 4893

My typeset neatness and -a and -m fix, 4902

My brief Etc/MACHINES addition, 4912

My modification to findcmd() for memory leaks, 4923, plus comment
alteration by Bart, 4924

Sven's patch for completion after various reserved words, 4930

My patch for compiler warnings, 4931

My configuration fix for when tgetent() accepts a null argument but
then tgetstr() dumps core, 4939

Sven's alteration of `-t' behaviour, 4940.  This is slightly
incompatible with previous patched versions of 3.1.5 since now you don't
need '-tc' with -T.  However, you now do need '-tn' in cases where you
don't want normal completion tried after a -T matches.

Sven's new completion functions, 4850, 4881, 4941, 4942, 4943, 4944,
4946, 4949, 4950, plus my addition of function pointers, 4945.  The
example file is now in Misc/new-completion-examples.

(Effect of) fix from Helmut Jarausch in 4947 partly due to change
missed in patch.
