I haven't managed to reproduce this problem, but I have been meaning
to look into a problem with the yank command being used right after
an auto-added slash.  I think the yank should leave the slash there,
but perhaps it should be made to depend on what text is being yanked
(i.e.  make it work just like the yanked text had been typed).
