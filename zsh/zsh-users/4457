Assume I have an executable in my $PATH named `armadillo'.

In versions 2.5.0 and 3.0.8 I only had to type ar<TAB> to execute it.
Since ar(1) is in my path, too, zsh would beep and let me choose between ar and
armadillo.

However in versions 3.1.9 and 4.0.2, ar<TAB> expands to `ar ', and does not give
me the opportunity to choose what I wanted. I find this very annoying.

Browsing the man and searching the web for how to revert to the old behavior
did not produce the answer. Frankly, I don't know waht to search for..

I hope someone here would help me,

	Dan.
