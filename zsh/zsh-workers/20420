The make used by the *BSD's has extensions for assignment operators,
viz. ``?='' and ``!='', which aren't handled properly.

     ?=      Assign the value to the variable if it is not already defined.

     !=      Expand the value and pass it to the shell for execution and
             assign the result to the variable.  Any newlines in the result
             are replaced with spaces.

% echo 'FOO!=bar' >Makefile
% make <TAB>
make (eval):1: command not found: FOO!=bar

...

Regards,
Geoff
