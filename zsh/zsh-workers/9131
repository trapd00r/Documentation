Subject: Build problem with new module aliases & nondynamic linking
To: zsh-workers <zsh-workers@sunsite.auc.dk>
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Zsh builds from Tanaka's repository are failing when building with
dynamic module loading disabled (configure --diable-dynamic).  This
problem started happening after the new module aliases were added.

This is the make output I'm seeing:

srcdir='.' MODBINS='modules-bltin' \
XMODCF='./xmods.conf' /bin/sh ./mkbltnmlst.sh bltinmods.list
ERROR: linked-in module `cap' depends on `zsh/cap'
make[2]: *** [bltinmods.list] Error 1
make[2]: Leaving directory `zsh/Src'
make[1]: *** [modobjs] Error 2
make[1]: Leaving directory `zsh/Src'
