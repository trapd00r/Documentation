I build my own when I can but all to often, I don't have the option. I'm
often working briefly on client machines and to have zsh already
installed there is a great help. Even 3.0 is better than struggling with
ksh. If you can get 4.2.1 into Solaris 10, that'll be really fantastic.
Just a pity it'll be a while before they upgrade from Solaris 8 here.
