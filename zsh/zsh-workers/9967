} P.S.: I just noted that the CVS does not contain the (rather
}       important) patches from 9953 and 9958.

Yes, I believe Tanaka has stopped updating it, so you won't be able
to use it to diff against any longer.

It looks like a repository at Zanshin is not going to fly right now,
so we should either look into sourceforge (or something like it) or
perhaps Clint or one of the other folks who was already mirroring
Tanaka's repository could take over, at least temporarily?
