zsh -f where zsh is 3.0.5:

zagzig% coproc tee /tmp/capture
[1] 31145
zagzig% jobs
[1]  + running    tee /tmp/capture

Note that the coproc job is marked "+" even though it's impossible to bring
it back to the foreground.  If you start other jobs, they can end up marked
"-", as if "fg" would prefer the coproc.  Not a big bug, but a bug.  (There
probably ought to be a third mark to identify the coprocess; perhaps "*" ?)
