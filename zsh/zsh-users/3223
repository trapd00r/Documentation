Hello *,

When I put the 'jobs' builtin command in my precmd function, zsh
exits immediately without giving me a warning that I still have
background jobs.

I found out that zsh exits without a warning if the previous command
was the jobs command.

But in my precmd function there are many commands after the jobs
command.

Can someone tell me why this happens? (I'm using zsh 3.0.8)
