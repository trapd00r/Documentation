Subject: down-line-or-search doesn't go to last entry
MIME-Version: 1.0

I have {up,down}-line-or-search bound to Up/Down, and I noticed
recently that down-line-or-search won't go to the empty entry anymore.
Ie if you press up and then down, it will still have the previous
entry in the cmdline, I have to press page down where I have
down-history to get back to the empty line.
