Yes, it looks like ut_user is standard in struct utmpx.  Solaris even
has ut_user in struct utmp, but #define's ut_name for
compatibility---this might be a clue to how the utmpx version currently
works on Solaris.

On the main line I'll commit this as follows:

/*
 * In utmpx, the ut_name field is replaced by ut_user.
 * Howver, on some systems ut_name may already be defined this
 * way for the purposes of utmp.
 */
# ifndef ut_name
#  define ut_name ut_user
# endif

but I don't dare try that out on the 4.2 branch.
