Subject: a simple translation to tcsh?
Mime-Version: 1.0 (Apple Message framework v915)
Date: Fri, 28 Dec 2007 15:59:55 -0800
X-Mailer: Apple Mail (2.915)
X-Virus-Scanned: ClamAV using ClamSMTP

I use the conditional test

[[  $(sw_vers -productVersion) < 10.5  ]]

on Mac OS X to test whether the current OS version (in my case 10.5.1)  
is 10.4.11 or earlier. This takes advantage of a property of zsh that  
I haven't figured out how to replicate in a tcsh script.

Is there a simple way to do this, as it is a small nightmare to  
implement as an arithmetic test.


Thanks.

Bill Scott
