The mailing list archive seems to be updated once a day, so you can't
find today's patches yet (but then of course you couldn't look them
up by sequence number either).  As for what "zefram1" et al return,
I'd forgotten that that form would clash with old subversion numbers.
I'm going to skip ahead 100 numbers, therefore, to get past that clash.
I suggest that everyone else using this scheme start off at patch
"pws100" etc.
