That would make sense to me, but I _do_ have the alias defined before the
function.  And since this was no problem until I upgraded to 3.1.7-pre-4
I suspect I found a tiny bug???

Hm, this sounds like a solution, but I'd hate to do that, because I've got
them all nicely sorted by subject in my .zsh/alias.  :-(

Thanks,
 Andy.
