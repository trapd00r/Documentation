Even in that case, the problem is really with the reuse of the format,
rather than the special argument-picking syntax.  Maybe it would be best to
have a command-line option to turn it (the reuse of the format specifier,
that is) off --- or even on, since it might be regarded as a little florid
for default behaviour.  But I suppose we're going to have to stick with ksh
if we're trying to match it.
