Thanks for your attention. I posted this to zsh-workers because I
found it weird enough to be very likely a bug in source code. Could
you tell me if you are having performance problem with aptitude
tab-complete? Also, let me describe my problems in more detail.

If I type "sudo apt-get install a" and hit Tab, I only get a short
(yet noticeable) delay of about one second. But when I type "sudo
aptitude install a" and hit Tab, zsh freezes, one of the CPU cores get
100% loaded. It will recover after some 10 seconds. However after
this, the tab-completion of aptitude is as quick as apt-get's, until I
log out of zsh.

I am using the version from git repo:

xiaq@~> zsh --version
zsh 4.3.11-dev-1 (i686-pc-linux-gnu)

and my system:

xiaq@~> uname -a
Linux xxx 2.6.32-28-generic #55-Ubuntu SMP Mon Jan 10 21:21:01 UTC
2011 i686 GNU/Linux

After typing "sudo aptitude" and hitting Tab, the output is (build-dep
is absent):
