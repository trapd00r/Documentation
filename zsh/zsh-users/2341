:> How do you decide whether or not a file is an ASCII file? file(1)
:> doesn't always work.
:A list of file types to exclude then?
:I think it's an idea worth pursuing at the least

There are lots of greps around which have an option not to spew data from
binary files.  I don't think any of the other file qualifiers is as weighty
as requiring every file to be open()ed/read()/close()d.  In fact, from
inspection all of them can get their information from
opendir()/{readdir()/stat()}.../closedir() not
opendir()/{readdir()/stat()/open()/read()/close()}.../closedir()
