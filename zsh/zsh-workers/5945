Hallo,
I got into the following problem (only tested on zsh-3.1*)

thomas@digger [thomas]> a='echo x'
thomas@digger [thomas]> echo $a
echo x
thomas@digger [thomas]> $a
zsh: command not found: echo x
 
The correct output would be 'x'. I get the correct output in other shells
(sh,ksh,bash).

Regards
Thomas Ziehmer
