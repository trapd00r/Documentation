To get ``#define HAVE_DLFCN_H 0'' with the ``0'' there you would have to
have edited config.h and ignored the comment on the previous line:
	/* Define if you have the <dlfcn.h> header file.  */
because that generated lines are either ``#define ... 1'' or
``/* #undef ... */''.   ``#define ... 0'' is not generated.

:It should be
:/* #undef HAVE_DLFCN_H */

I wasn't automatically presuming that it was user error (the opposite of
``define'' being ``not define''; not ``define as some other value'') and was
allowing for the case where it may have been a valid point.
