But this is not caused by calling a function when the prompt is
redisplayed. This is caused by the NOTIFY option. And any user
can disable it. In my case, a job shouldn't terminate when I'm
typing something in zle, or something bad happened.

Perhaps I could disable NOTIFY when zle is active and use TRAPCLD with
zle -M in this case. Is it possible? For instance with a setopt nonotify
in precmd and a setopt notify in preexec?

How can I do that (to rebuild the prompt when clear-screen is called)?

OK.
