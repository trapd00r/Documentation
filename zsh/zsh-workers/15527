The whole point is that this isn't part of the base shell and expecting
people to have to fiddle with its settings just because they are using
different options seems to me unnecessary.  So I was proposing the fixed
feature that it uses full prompt substitution; it uses zsh-specific
features in any case.  But it could be done a lot of different ways.
