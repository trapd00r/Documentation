Hi everyone,

This is my chpwd function:

	chpwd() { 
	  case ${PWD} in
	    /calm/*)  echo "//${NODENAME}:/ccview/norton_hari_vu${PWD}";;
	    *)  echo "//${NODENAME}:${PWD}";;
	  esac
	}

The objective is to keep eterm(in emacs) synchronized with the
shell(zsh), if the "/calm/*" statement looks like this:

	/calm/*)  echo "//${NODENAME}:/ccview/norton_hari_vu/${PWD}";;

it does not work, nothing gets echoed at all, it is as if this line
does not exist at all, note the only differnce in the 2 lines is the
addition of 1 slash(/) before ${PWD}, when ${PWD} is expanded, there
are actually 2 slashes(like in /ccview/norton_hari_vu//calm/repl), i
wonder whether the problem is related to my autoremoveslash setting,
right now i have it working using the 1st line, but i still think it
is a bug in zsh, anyone have any idea what is going on?

Thanks,
hari
