I doubt it.  That's what <sys/resource.h> and RLIMIT_xxx is for.  The
first 5 limits (0-4) happen to be the same across all the following
systems, but RLIMIT_NOFILE is different:

AIX:     #define RLIMIT_NOFILE   7
FreeBSD: #define     RLIMIT_NOFILE   8 /* number of open files */
Linux:	 RLIMIT_NOFILE = 7,
Solaris: #define     RLIMIT_NOFILE   5 /* file descriptors */
Tru64:   #define RLIMIT_NOFILE       6         /* open files */
