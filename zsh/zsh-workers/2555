Sorry, I phrased that a bit loosely.  The remark only applied to aliases
which end in space and are therefore supposed to force alias expansion
on the next word.  In other words,

% alias foo='echo foo1 '
% alias bar=foo
% alias rod=bar
% foo rod
foo1 bar

the foo forces rod to be expanded, but only as far as bar; the bar does
not get expanded to foo.  This is the behaviour at least as far back as
2.5.0 and no-one has complained, but I suspect it's an oversight rather
than a feature and I'd be happy to try and fix it.
