By the way, if there is a reproducible problem of this kind, valgrind
ought to be able to tell you what's going on, but if anyone does that
and finds a problem, I will need some kind of digested analysis as to
what it's saying about the code, please (it does not need to be well
informed about code structure, I mean something along the lines of "it
looks like this variable was allocated at this point while the code at
this other point is trying to write beyond the end of it").  I have
unfortunately neither the time, the inclination, nor the ability to
second-guess what's going on from a raw valgrind report about a
programme run by someone else for an issue I can't reproduce.
