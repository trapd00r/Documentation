I'll commit this now.

Well it is really the _arguments handling of a 0 return code and not
_guard which I believe could be bettered. That is, it should complete
possible options (like the -c3nf example) as well as displaying
`number'.

I'm happy to require _guard patterns to need to match their thing
partially, hence the commit on the _vnc change. I agree though that
_guard's style of pattern matching can always be extended with an option
later if the need arises.
