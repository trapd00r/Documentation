What abot including these help files in program itself? (That is, for
every command add string with description). These way it is possible  
provide help for user-defined commands (from loadable modules). The manual
page for zshbuiltins itself could then be generated from these
descriptions; this way, if some module is added to distribution, it will
be automatically included.

Also, _quite_ fine would be to have this description as separate file
(for modules as well - let's say zsh.msg for zsh, comctl.msg and so on).
It would provide fo easy i18n sometimes ;)
 
cheers
