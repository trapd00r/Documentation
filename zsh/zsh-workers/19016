That makes sense.

Used to like that in 4DOS too myself. Was the only piece of shareware I
ever registered.

That's a pity. I have preexec testing for <-> and other combinations
like (#b)(<->).(<->) so that I can type numbers to get at MH messages.
I then need a few strategic alias 11='nocorrect 11' so that correction
doesn't offer me X11 or whatever as a correction. With pattern aliases,
back references could disable substituting the word as the last
argument which might have other uses such as commands which don't want
the file as the last argument (e.g. mozilla -remote).

Suffix completion could actually look for files, perhaps in it's own
path array and could allow the suffix to be omitted. So for wine
programs you wouldn't need to type the .exe and could put the program
directories in a suffix path.

There isn't much point: completing existing aliases when defining new
ones isn't that useful anyway.
