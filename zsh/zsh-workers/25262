This isn't new, you always got this, even if there was a function name
in front.  It's there because there's a test that a function body
consists of sufficiently complex code that it can't be simplified to
executing a single shell structure.  As this can, you get the error.

That seems an odd thing to test at this point in the code, and the more
I look at it the more I think it should be testing the return value of
the function instead...  It's odd this hasn't shown up before, but I
suppose there was a reasonable chance of a parse error occurring before
the parameter had been set to 1.
