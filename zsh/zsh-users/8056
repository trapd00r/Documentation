Unfortunately that's almost exactly the opposite of what it means.

What HASH_LIST_ALL means is that the *first* time you do completion of 
command word -- not the first time for each new command; the single first 
time you complete with the cursor in the command word position -- that the 
entire search path is added to the hash.  The alternative, with the option 
unset, is for the hash search to stop as soon as it finds the command in 
question, then continue where it left off if necessary later.  In neither
case are previously-hashed directories searched again (except for relative
paths like "." and "..") until after a "rehash" is done.
