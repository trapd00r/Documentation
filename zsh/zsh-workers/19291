} Are you demanding that sometimes when zle is started up, such as
} for a continuation line, you want to maintain the current keymap?

Yes.  If you plow though the zsh-users thread, the request for zle to
start in command mode was really a request for zle in vi mode to "act
like vi" -- that is, start in command mode, but not leave insert mode
until you explicitly press ESC.  Pressing RETURN in vi to go on to the
next line of input does not take you back to command mode, so I presume
that the user wouldn't want the PS2 prompt in zsh to behave that way.

And anyway, it'd be extremely confusing to have "select" loops start in
command mode, because there's not normally even any history to scroll
back through in that case.
