} [...] it also allows one to give additional arguments as in
} `*(F:func::arg1::arg2:)' and so on -- these are available as `$2'

} (Maybe this is going a bit too far?)

I don't have a problem with using reply/REPLY, but I think supplying
additional arguments inside the glob qualifier is a bit excessive (and also
accounts for most of the size of this patch, no?).
