Well, OK ... with 27479 applied and with \eq bound to push-line-or-edit,
either one of

schaefer<501> rm ./\<RET><ESC>q<TAB>

or

schaefer<501> rm ./\<ESC><RET><TAB>

leads to

schaefer<501> rm ./=FF=FF=FF=FF./

Needless to say there is no directory named =FF=FF=FF=FF. in the current
directory.  So something is still not quite right here, but it's
differently not quite right when you have an actual multi-line
buffer at PS1 as opposed to a PS2 prompt.
