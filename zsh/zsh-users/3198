Hi

I have a problem and I would like to hear if anybody has had the same
problem. 

When I login on a host with Windowmaker as my windowmanager and zsh as
login shell I get the following error in my .dt/startlog:

X connection to solaris:0.0 broken (explicit kill or server shutdown).

As it can be seen the connection is just terminated. The funny thing is
that this only happens when the host is running Solaris 7 on a Sparc
platform, not Intel.

If I change the shell to bash I have no problem at all. Any ideas?

There is no funny stuff in my .zlogin that could be the source of
problem.

Best regards and thanks
