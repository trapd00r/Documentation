Bourne shell compatible.

I didn't know that.  I thought it was an oversight of zsh developers in
the default settings of zsh.  Now I know better, of course.

Fair enough.  The problem in this case transposes itself to "make" then.
"make" *has* to make that SHELL is set to a Bourne shell compatible
shell.  If it leaves it at zsh, it's a bug.

In that light, we'll avoid the test and change the diagnostics to:
