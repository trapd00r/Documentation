Yes. It understand it for any file name. You can even mix for-and
back-slashes:

mw1g017@MW1G17C:/cygdrive/d/temp/zsh% dd if='d:\temp/zsh\zsh.html'
of=foo
2184+1 records in
2184+1 records out


So, what is needed to support it is

- add backslash as path seprator to _path_files
- _path_files should recognize 'x:\' as "root".

Hmm ... there seems to be one more problem. Zsh can glob 'c:/Progr*' to
'c:/Program Files' but not 'c:\Progr*'. It seems, that it needs more
deep support; globbing code should recognize '\' as valid path separator
as well.

Oh, yes, and NT has case-insensitive file system, that means, globbing
should be case-insensitive by default as well.
