} What's this double colon?  It's very much not portable.

Eh?  That's been legal in every "make" I've used since 1985.  Where do
you know it to fail?

It tells "make" that there are different commands for the same target
when there are different dependencies.  That is, normally if you write

target: dependency1
	command1

target: dependency2
	command2

You'll get either an error or something like

    warning: overriding commands for target `target'
    warning: ignoring old commands for target `target'

If you use a double colon, it means that "make" should execute command1
when dependency1 is out of date, and should execute command2 when
dependency2 is out of date, i.e. they're no longer mutually exclusive.
