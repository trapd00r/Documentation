Well one suggestion would be "Don't use Lookout!". That said, I don't
think it's safe to assume that all list members can easily add custom
headers... With most console based mailers (which most people who post
to the list frequently seem to use).

I personally think that subscriber only posting (but allowing
non-members to post with confirmation) is the best way to go. 

I think that most of the time, I see more viruses / spam coming from
this list than actual list traffic... At the very least, I'll echo the
request to stop stripping Received lines. This makes it difficult /
impossible to report spam and viruses sent to the list, and also
probably reduces the effectiveness of some spam filters.

I'm not sure exactly what needs to happen, but it seems like it would be
pretty trivial to configure the MLM to allow traffic from one list to
the other, if that's what needs to be done. I don't know EZMLM, but this
would be pretty simple in Mailman.
