4.0.5 has been imminent for some time now, but every time I say I'm
thinking about releasing it, people say, hang on here's a list of other
patches to look at.  It looks like no-one has.  I think it's perfectly
releasable in it's present form, however, so I may be able to sneak it
out while everyone's on holiday.

The target for 4.1.0 was to have the parameter support tidied up.
However, that seems to be receeding into the background, too.  We
really need to draw up a more limited set of goals since at the moment
it looks like nobody's got the time for large scale new code.  There's
plenty of new stuff there in modules and the odd builtin.
