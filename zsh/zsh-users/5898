Hmm.  This appears to be a bug introduced in the 4.0 series.

In 3.0.7, `1000G' gives a feep.

In 4.0.6, it crashes here:

#0  0x806c307 in checkcurline ()
#1  0x806b1e3 in movehistent ()
#2  0x401a27aa in zle_goto_hist ()
#3  0x401a388e in vifetchhistory ()
#4  0x401a7697 in execzlefunc ()
#5  0x401a727d in zleread ()

In 4.1.0-dev-7, it neither feeps nor crashes.

} Also, I wonder if there is a way to completely reset history in the
} interactive session and start from event 1?

No, there isn't.
