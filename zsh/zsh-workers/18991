the location has not changed. /dev/pts are for SVR4 ptys; it depends on =
your
system if they are compiled in kernel (as well as old-style ones).

This won't without suitable configure tests. You can't assume glibc is =
the
only existing libc implementation. Your patch simply kills zpty on my
system. If you change your patch to probe for SVR4-style ptys on Linux =
in
addition to traditional ones without touching other systems, I's say it =
may
be included.

The same applies to headers, you can't include headers without testing =
for
their existence. error.h does not exist here.

BTW convention is that all includes and in <module>.h not in C files, =
but it
may be not as strict.
