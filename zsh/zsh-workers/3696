Damn.  I'm usually pretty good at writing portable sh code; I didn't
realise this construct would be a problem.

That won't work everywhere either.

That's clever -- the ( is quoted.  There must have been a quoting
confusion earlier.

The scripts were actually developed on a system using zsh-3.1.2 as sh,
and it also works for me using zsh-3.0.5.  Which version did it fail on?

That it does.  I'll have another go at the scripts, but unfortunately
my choice of shells is limited to zsh, bash, pdksh and ash, so more wide
testing will be required.  But that's what the 3.1 branch is for.
