Zsh emits color codes only in completion listings (i.e., when more than
one match is displayed simultaneously), not when there is only one match
inserted on the line and not when doing menu completion (where matches
are cycled on the command line, as opposed to menu selection where
they're shown in columns).

Even in listings/selection, there's no color change sequence emitted
between the prefix and any suffixes; color codes are printed only before
and after each entire match.
