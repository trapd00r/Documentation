I always assumed this to be X11-Protocol, or some terminal-driver or
daemon interaction, as it is the more prominent the longer/slower the line
is on which you are connected. I see the same behavior for many tools as
telnet, rlogin, ssh. (It might be connected to the curses library ?)

Well, I definitely agree on that !
