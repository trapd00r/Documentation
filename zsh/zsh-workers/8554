If you're planning on mirroring CVS trees, cvsup ( at
http://www.polstra.com/projects/freeware/CVSup/ ) is even faster than
rsync, since it knows how to transmit CVS diffs quickly.  It will also
mirror regular files (it falls back to the rsync protocol for those
files).  You can use it to either mirror the whole CVS tree, or keep a
checked-out copy up to date.
