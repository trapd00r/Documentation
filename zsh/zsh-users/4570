zsh does not internally define the colours.  That above is not zsh
outputting colours.

It's a property of the terminal.  You're using the "ANSI Colour
Escapes".  The colours and effects are defined and standardised by the
American National Standards Institute.

You could modify the source-code of the terminal program to handle more
colours and more effects.  Many/most terminal programs will allow you to
change the precise colour-tones used through their normal config.

In all of this, zsh does nothing.  There's a couple of added features
where zsh simply knows about the escapes and can output them.
