Hello,

I am a happy user of zsh, but there is one thing where I think that the way
bash handles it is more useful. It is the function of <backspace> while
editing the command line. Consider the following example:

zsh:
  roland@minnesota:~% cd /usr/share/doc/zsh/<backspace>
 causes to change the line into the following:
  roland@minnesota:~% cd                               

bash:
  roland@minnesota:~> cd /usr/share/doc/zsh<backspace>
 causes to change the line into the following:
  roland@minnesota:~> cd /usr/share/doc/

Is there a way to make zsh to behave like bash in this example?

Please, Cc: me to any answers.

Roland
