    Hi Andrey :)

    In fact I'm Cc'ing the list, not you O:) Well, I just told
"reply" to Mutt, and your address end up in the To and the list
address in the Cc headers.

    I've fixed it with this message :)

    OK, I did read it bad: I missed that "separate field" part...
Thanks for the explanation :)))

    So, effectively, zsh is wrong here. It should do field
separation, as dictated by the standard, but each parameter must go
to a separate field...
