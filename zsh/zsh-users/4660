But it's actually a cygwin program, at least on Windows, right?  Aren't 
all cygwin programs GPLed because of cygwin1.dll?  Now as to whether 
including a GPL program in your commercial product is OK I don't know, 
IANAL.  And perhaps I'm even wrong about the cygwin thing, but AFAIK 
that's why MinGW was invented -- cygwin licensing problems.
