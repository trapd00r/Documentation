It would of course help a lot if you also posted your code, but at a guess,
where you have -d array in your compdef call, change it to -ld array, where
array is the array with your descriptions, i think. Maybe the problem is
you don't have a -d array at all. ie
mydescriptions=('No Password' 'Username = Password' etc)
compdef blabla -ld mydescriptions blabla
