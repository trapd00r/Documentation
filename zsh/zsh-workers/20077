completing after disable -r results in:
  (eval):1: parse error near `}'

Is it perhaps new that `}' and `{' can be disabled because _disable and
_enable haven't been updated in a long time so they may have once
worked. This could also have been caused by a change in _arguments. Or
maybe they never worked.

Anyway the two functions can be directly fixed with this patch.
