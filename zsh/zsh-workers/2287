I realize now that the following should heve been put into Etc/MACHINES
instead of Etc/BUGS:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
sed seems to be broken on HP-UX 10.20 which prevents prototype
generation and the result is that zsh fails to compile.  sed in
HP-UX 9.x works.  Get an older working sed or try to get a fixed
version from your OS vendor (or write a makepro.sed which works
on all platforms where the current version works).
------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can also get GNU sed which should works.
