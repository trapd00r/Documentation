I wonder if perhaps another state name would be better.  "Stay in word" is 
a directive, whereas everything else in compstate is, well, state data.

What if it were compstate[compound_word] and the value is the separator
character to insert?  (Or perhaps two characters, corresponding to
"compvalues -s" and "compvalues -S" in that order.)

Normally compstate[compound_word] would be unset, but "compvalues -i" 
would set it based on the parse.
