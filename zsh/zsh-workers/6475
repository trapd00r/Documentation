I've made up another pre-patch for 3.0.6, which carries the version number
3.0.6-pre-3.  The set is now:
        ftp://ftp.brasslantern.com/pub/zsh/zsh-3.0.5-3.0.6-pre-0.diff
        ftp://ftp.brasslantern.com/pub/zsh/zsh-3.0.6-pre-0-pre-1.diff
        ftp://ftp.brasslantern.com/pub/zsh/zsh-3.0.6-pre-1-pre-2.diff
        ftp://ftp.brasslantern.com/pub/zsh/zsh-3.0.6-pre-2-pre-3.diff
        ftp://ftp.brasslantern.com/pub/zsh/zsh-3.0.6-pre-3-pre-4.diff

Remember that after applying patches to 3.0.5, you must "touch stamp-h.in"
before running configure to prevent make from attempting to rerun autoconf
and autoheader.

Checksums on the latest diff:

(BSD)  34316    63
(SYSV) 32741 126 zsh-3.0.6-pre-3-pre-4.diff

Except for the several items noted below, I believe the code to be ready
for release as 3.0.6.  Things that still need to be addressed:

* I haven't done anything with Greg Badros's color completion patches.

* I haven't put in PWS's 64-bit-on-32-bit-machines patches.

Here are the new ChangeLog entries since -pre-2:

! 1999-06-05 08:26  Bart Schaefer <schaefer@zsh.org>
! 
! 	* Doc/zsh.texi, Doc/zshexpn.man, Src/glob.c: Add time-in-seconds
! 	granularity to the a, c, and m glob qualifiers, as per Sven's
!       patch in 6458, and document this change.
! 
! 1999-06-05 08:18  Bart Schaefer <schaefer@zsh.org>
! 
! 	* Doc/zsh.texi, Doc/zshoptions.man: Add Wayne's manual page fixes
! 	from 6443 to zsh.texi, but change "blanks" to "whitespace" in the
!       HIST_REDUCE_BLANKS description in both documents.
! 
! 1999-06-05 08:04  Bart Schaefer <schaefer@zsh.org>
! 
! 	* Doc/zshbuiltins.man, Doc/zshoptions.man, Src/hashtable.c,
! 	Src/hist.c, Src/zle_hist.c, Src/zsh.h: History and doc bugfixes
! 	collected from the 3.1.x source by Wayne Davison and posted in
! 	6436, 6439, and 6443; except that history files are still written
! 	in the traditional format, but can be read in either old or new
!       (3.1.6) format.
! 
! 1999-06-04 15:44  Bart Schaefer <schaefer@zsh.org>
! 
! 	* Src/subst.c: Nested substitutions should require braces; adapted
!       from PWS's patch in 6464.
! 
! 1999-06-02 15:04  Bart Schaefer <schaefer@zsh.org>
! 
! 	* Src/subst.c: Final tweak to quoting in ${ }; PWS, 6433
! 
! 1999-06-01 18:03  Bart Schaefer <schaefer@zsh.org>
! 
! 	* Src/builtin.c, Src/params.c: Two parameter fixes from 3.1.5,
! 	adapted to 3.0.6 by PWS in zsh-workers 6419: typeset -m restored
! 	unset parameters which hadn't been removed from the table; in fn1()
! 	{ local foo; unset foo; foo=bar; }, foo is restored at local level,
! 	whereas if the `unset foo' appeared in a nested function it would
!       have been restored at global level, which was presumably wrong.
! 
! 1999-06-01 17:54  Bart Schaefer <schaefer@zsh.org>
! 
! 	* Doc/zsh.texi: Document new quoting behavior inside ${...}, as per
!       PWS in 6416.
! 
! 1999-06-01 16:59  Bart Schaefer <schaefer@zsh.org>
! 
! 	* Src/zle_refresh.c: Temporarily restore the old line buffer when
! 	moving around to clear the completion list, because on terminals
! 	that can't "move right" we need to redraw any characters the motion
!       passes over; Sven, 6411.
! 
! 1999-05-31 22:14  Bart Schaefer <schaefer@zsh.org>
! 
! 	* Src/subst.c: Adapt PWS's patch from zsh-workers 6335 to permit
! 	quoted strings inside ${ }, which permits e.g. ${(f)"$(typeset)"}
!       equivalent to "${(@f)$(typeset)}".
! 
! 1999-05-31 20:42  Bart Schaefer <schaefer@zsh.org>
! 
! 	* Src/exec.c, Src/jobs.c, Src/zsh.h: Revise and explain in lengthy
! 	comments the handling of tty process groups when pipelines end in
! 	shell builtin constructs; Sven and PWS in zsh-workers 6240, 6257,
!       6258, 6285, and 6302, with minor adjustment for 3.0.x.
! 
! 1999-05-31 18:48  Bart Schaefer <schaefer@zsh.org>
! 
! 	* Doc/Makefile.in: Handle the (un)installation of more than 9
! 	subfiles created by makeinfo; suggested by Andrej Borsenkow in
!       zsh-workers 6392.
