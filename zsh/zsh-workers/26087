Right, the behaviour isn't new.  It seems as if the subprocess is
reading EOF from the input.

% foo() { print $1; print hello >$1; [[ -e $1 ]] || print Ouch! }
% foo >(sleep 1; read foo || print Failed)
/proc/self/fd/12
Failed

I don't understand why it would do that, given the order in which things
apparently happen (there's roughly a second gap between the messages, as
you'd expect).  Waiting the other way round, I get

% foo() { print $1; (sleep 1; print hello) >$1; [[ -e $1 ]] || print Ouch! }
% foo >(read foo || print Failed)
/proc/self/fd/12
foo: write error: bad file descriptor
Failed

I printed $ERRNO and it's zero.  Note that the read in the subprocess only
fails *after* the attempt to write fails.

It's also not clear to me why this is so different from "print hello | read
foo", which works, except to note that pipes in this case exchange a sync
word.
