That sounds really dangerous.  You're offering a hook for someone to
execute arbitrary code as root.  If someone breaks your user account
they could for example add a file in your home directory that resets
the root password or does some other really mean things.  If you want
root to have the same setup as your regular user you should put it
somewhere that only root can write.

Other than that I have a very familiar setup with Zsh initialization
files contained in a Git repository in /usr/local/etc/zsh so that I
can keep changes logged and synced between separate systems.

Allan
