Subject: faster completion for "open -a" in Apple OS X 10.4

This may be of interest to Apple users:

Wataru Kagawa and I came up with a fast completion for "open -a" that  
makes use of the new metadata feature in Apple OS X v. 10.4 (the unix  
counterpart of "Spotlight").  This makes it possible to have an  
almost instant completion without relying on a traditional cache  
mechanism.

I use a very customized version of open and _open, but the essentials  
of the completion function are here:
