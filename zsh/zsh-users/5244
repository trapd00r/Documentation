    Hi Oliver :)

    IMHO the stty solution is cleaner and more portable. BASH is
bloated with things like those, please don't imitate ;))

    For example, bash has a non-POSIX, non-SuSv3 compliant
implementation of 'printf' builtin, and zsh has one fully compliant,
and this is applicable to more builtins. The '-s' flag to read is not
necessary at all. UNIX has this policy (IMHO, again): keep it simple
and divide the tasks among processes instead of bloating one of them.
