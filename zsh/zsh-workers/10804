Right (%m does the same). I was torn in two here... if you have a
select-prompt like

  'Match %m  Line %l  %p'

I think it is nice that the `Line...' doesn't move back and forth when 
moving from match number 9 to number 10 or something like that. And I
was to lazy to allow `%<num>l'.
I'll see what I can do here, which may well result in just removing
the alignement.

Yep, shouldn't be too hard (see above, keyword `lazy').

There is a very simple builtin default, but maybe, yes.

Most of the things we need are indeed there. It's mostly a matter of
passing one more bit of information from the function that displays
the prompt back to the main listing function.
