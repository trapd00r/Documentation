oh sorry the completion for kill.... sorry - it's late.  i don't know
much about the new completion system; with the old one you could just
change 'ps x' to 'ps ux'

compctl -j -P '%' + -s '`ps x | tail +2 | cut -c1-5`' + \
        -x 's[-] p[1]' -k "($signals[1,-3])" -- kill killall

for the new system you'd probably want to edit the function '_pids'
(which is called from the _kill function).

sorry for being so obtuse...
