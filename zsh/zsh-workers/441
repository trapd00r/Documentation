Are you using a linux kernel somewhere in the 1.3.* then the cause of 
your trouble is that the definition of the signals was moved to 
/usr/include/asm/signals.h /usr/include/linux/signals.h only has an 
#include  in it. The patch i used was:

configure.in: 348-351
for SIGNAL_H in /usr/include/bsd/sys/signal.h   dnl Next
+		/usr/include/asm/signal.h	dnl Linux, new kernel
                /usr/include/linux/signal.h     dnl Linux
                /usr/include/sys/signal.h       dnl Almost everybody else
                /dev/null;                      dnl Just in case we fall through

It fixed the problem for me after I ran configure again, that is....
