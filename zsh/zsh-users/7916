No, there isn't.  The correction mechanism isn't yet programmable like 
completion.  (Consider also the case of

  cp file1 file2 directory

where you presumably want all three arguments corrected.)

This probably indicates an error in the zpty module, so if you don't need 
that you can ignore the failure.  I believe there was a discussion about 
this on zsh-workers a while ago; hmm, the MACHINES file says this should 
be OK in 10.3.  I don't know any more about it.
