I'm having a lot of problems with using readline in a project,
and I suggested to the other developers that we use zle instead.
It's very likely that we will do that, if we can rip it apart of
zsh. ;-)

This made me wonder. Why not make it a library? As an
alternative to readline? Now readline is cool, but we all know
zle does better in a whole lot of ways.
