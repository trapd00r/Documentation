} When this goes in, I'll rename the ChangeLog and ChangeLog-Release to
} ChangeLog-3.1 (which Bart says is the correct name).

The argument being that ChageLog-3.0 begins with the 3.0 release, so it
would be confusing to have ChangeLog-4.0 begin with the 3.1 release.

Put another way, "ChangeLog" always refers to the current number series,
so the only reason to append a number to ChangeLog-X.Y is to show that
it pertains to a number series *other* than 4.0.
