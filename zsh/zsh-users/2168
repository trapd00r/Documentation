Hello All,

Once again I appreciated all the help that I have been given.  It was
definitely a typo problem when I place the
#!c:/bin/zsh/zsh.exe in my shell scripts.  After correcting the typo, the
shell script ran beautifully.

Thanks again to all who have taken the time to answer my questions,
Timothy

	There's not really any such thing as "x permission" in NT.  Anything
with

I

are
	resolved in Amol's port.

zsh

	I don't believe so.

	} Do I need to name the shell script in a
	} certain way in order for it to execute?

	Zsh first attempts to let the system run the named file, and then
when
	(if) that fails it looks at it for a #! line.  So ...

	If you give the script a .exe extension, NT will try to run it as a
	binary, I think.  Not good.

	If you give it a .bat extension, it'll try to run it as a batch
file.
	That's probably even worse, as bits of the script might actually
look
	sensible enough to the batch processor to cause something to happen.

	} I have tried including the
	} following line at the beginning of the shell script:
	} 
	} #!c:/bin/zsh/zhs.exe 
	                ^^
	Did you spell "zsh.exe" correctly in the shell script?

	Otherwise I'm without clue.
