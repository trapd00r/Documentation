If one class has n characters and the other has m , with n < m, only
the first n characters in both classes match (since the others have no 
corresponding character).

Damn, I should have used my first implementation (the would have been
`"<[-.,_/]=* <=* {a-z}={A-z}" ">=* <=*"' for the above).

But for me the internals of the code was simply more interesting than
spending even more time in finding a nice syntax (whic really isn't
that easy), especially since we seem to seriously think about a new
way to define completions.
