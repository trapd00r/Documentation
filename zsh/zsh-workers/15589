I'd have thought it should be in _values itself as _values should
ideally be able to work with multiple words. This "easiest fix" isn't
going to handle explicit exclusion lists though. I'm not sure whether
there shouldn't be exclusions between bs and ibs/obs for dd but as the
exclusions don't work here, I didn't worry.
