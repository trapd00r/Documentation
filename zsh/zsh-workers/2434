That's not surprising since local a=() in fact defined a function local and
a function a= which executed local b.  So the function called local
recursively calls itself and there is not exit from this recursion.  You
probably wanted to use it as

bug() {
	local a
	a=()
	...
}

You cannot initialise local variables with an array at declaration.  You
must use a separate assignment for that.
