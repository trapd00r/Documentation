No, you just create a new empty keymap, insert only the bindings you want
to allow, and swap it in.  I _think_ it's possible to replace the map used
by vared that way ...

You've lost me, I fear.  Why would you need to do that?  Vared is going
to assign the selected value to a variable, not run it as a command.
