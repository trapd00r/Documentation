I'm not convinced this is a good idea. If the binary or path to it
contains a space, you just broke it. It's probably better to just tell
people to make a short wrapper script. Also, if some apps parse spaces
in EDITOR and others don't, then you effectively have to _both_ keep
the path+binary space-free and not give any arguments. That seems
suboptimal. FWIW git interprets spaces in EDITOR but... AFAIK it has
always been the name of a binary and nothing more.
