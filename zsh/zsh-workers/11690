}     compstate[insert]=menu

} Works for me.

It doesn't work for me.  I get a listing and the first match inserted.

Ah, but I don't have the complist module loaded from .zshrc ... that's
the missing tidbit.  So (prior to the patch for autoloading menu-select)
I'd also have to put a zmodload in the definition file.

I therefore think it's worth keeping menu-select around as a widget even
if just as an autoloading hook.
