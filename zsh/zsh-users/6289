	That's extremely generous of you, thanks. But I don't think I want to
stay. I realized that I have no time to learn ZSH, using Bash is a lot more
comfortable and easier for me. Even Bash is something I don't use that
often right now. I wish I could leave, but still can't. And still get at
least five or six junk messages through this list.

	Thank you,
