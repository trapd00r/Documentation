} It shouldn't be possible for them both to return true.

Of course, I'm silly.  It certainly should be possible for both to return
true.  I keep forgetting that the difference between -t and -T is how they
treat the case of the style NOT being set, not how they treat it when it
IS set.

So in fact for the original question:

} }     % touch foo{1..3}
} }     % ls ~/foo*<tab>
} } 
} } ...and nothing happens!

You DO need to set the suffix style, but you need to set it to "false".

Which, now that I think about it, sounds backwards to me.  It means "do
not make a special case of expansions that have a suffix" but it *seems*
to mean "do not expand the suffix."  Which is how I got confused about
what _expand was testing with "zstyle -T" in the first place ...
