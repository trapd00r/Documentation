This is so complicated I'm unhappy about ripping the code from one to the
other without being told what's really going on, if anyone knows.

- What happened to the patch 4447 (from Bart) that was supposed to make
3.0.5 believe SIGWINCH signals?  Shouldn't that be in 3.0.6?

- Where did the code change between 3.0 and 3.1 originate anyway (and why)?
Searching for adjustwinsize in the zsh-workers archive doesn't produce a
patch to explain it, so it's hard to know what's a step forward and what's
a step backward.  It's all mixed in with little changes like moving the
definitions of the LINES and COLUMNS variables from hashtable.h to
params.c.
