That's a bit low level, I never type control anything except for control C from time to time or control H whey I
forget to set stty erase on a HP UX server ;-)

What I had in mind was, when I'm on the command line and I want to go right I type l, if I want to delete to end of
line I type D, that is the kind of list I thought would be useful ?

GREAT, I'll try it immediately, and edit-command-line was the thing I was looking for but didn't find but now I know
that it would not have helped me.

OK. with zshcontrib and zshroadmap and the zsh-lovers page and the from bash to z shell web page guess what I'll be
doing this weekend.

I'm updating my CV ;-))))))))
