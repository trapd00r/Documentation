    OK, I understand that. I imagined that the reason for the "-g"
option was not only speed (as told in the manual)

    Now I understand :)) I supposed that the ":t" modifier was
causing problems to the completion code, but I see that the real
problem is a lack of match. Of course I didn't noticed that at the
end of a (filename) completion the completion code appends an space
*or* a slash. It is SO familiar for me that I just didn't consider
it. Thanks for the explanation, Bart :)

    Oh, in fact I tried that too and it worked, so I was more
convinced than ever that the problem was in the ":t" modifier. I see
I was wrong...

    Thanks a lot for your useful and interesting explanation :)
