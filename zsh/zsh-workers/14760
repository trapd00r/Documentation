I gave up. In all cases I needed vesion number in at least two files
(configure.in and configure.ac) that makes the whole story useless.

I would suggest that for 4.1.1 (or when we decide to switch to autoconf-2.50
completely) we use version number in AC_INIT and VERSION_DATE autogenerated
from configure.ac change date. That leaves us with exactly one place to
edit. There remains version.yo but it can happily depend on configure.ac in
this case.

I'm going to commit this in 4.0 as final version.
