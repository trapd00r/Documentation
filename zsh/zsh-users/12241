Thanks A LOT for having tested that, Peter :) Any terminal emulator I've
tested works OK, the problem happened only in Linux virtual terminals,
that's why I asked (as I told, I seriously doubted that the problem was
a zsh one, but since it appeared with zsh I thought that somebody would
have had the same problem and could tell me if it was my fault, my
terminal fault or zsh's fault).

Yes, but I haven't had any confirmation from the kernel people. I will
have to ask again, although I'm afraid this issue can't and won't be
fixed: presentation should be done in userspace. The kernel already does
a great job allowing the use of UTF-8 for Unicode chars below U+00FF
directly.

Zsh works ok in X terminals with UTF-8 support, for what I've tested.
Under Linux VT things are different. The VT itself supports UTF-8 and it
is in UTF-8 mode, I've made sure of it, but presenting characters
correctly is something that a terminal emulator should do in userspace.
I think the same, except there aren't many terminal emulators for the
console ;) and dealing with Unicode chars can be tricky (there are a
very limited number of glyphs in the console, and composing chars are a
problem).

Well, just knowing that zsh is behaving OK is enough. I suppose I must
face the fact that if I want to use the console I won't be able to use
Unicode chars greater than U+00FF...

Again, thanks a lot :))
