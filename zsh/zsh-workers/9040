Try getting the setterm program at
http://www.moria.de/~michael/setterm/. It lets you read back responses
from the terminal easily. It would be easy to add handling for dtterm
and the escape code you mentioned above for getting the window title. I
did a similar thing with it to read the colour settings for an SGI xwsh.
