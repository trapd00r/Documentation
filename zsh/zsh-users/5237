Subject: 4.0.6
Date: Wed, 14 Aug 2002 13:04:23 +0100
Message-ID: <12293.1029326663@csr.com>
From: Peter Stephenson <pws@csr.com>

Bart pointed out Karl Tomlinson's termcap/terminfo fix from 17482 should
be in 4.0 and Thomas Stromberg sent a fix for _mount in 17542, so I have
updated 4.0.5 to 4.0.6 and sent it to Sourceforge.

Unfortunately the update script at ftp.zsh.org is currently playing
I'm-sorry-Dave-I-can't-do-that and mailing me repeated bogus replies to
the original message to fill my mailbox just as I'm about to go on
holiday, so it may not appear on the standard FTP site and mirrors just
yet.
