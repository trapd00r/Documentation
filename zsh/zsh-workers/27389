Looking at zsh-workers/27367 in the archive ...

What's up with the following hunk -- why was "cur" dropped?  Localizing
curcontext is boilerplate completion code.

-local curcontext="$curcontext" state line ret=1
+local context="$curcontext" state line ret=1


The rest looks OK, so I'll commit without that one change, but someone
else should test.
