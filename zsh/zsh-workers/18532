Being an interactive related feature, this isn't so critical but it would
be better if we can handle this. Adding a special case in bin_set()
instead of actually adding an option might perhaps be sufficient to
satisfy the specification. However, on the basis that zle is a separate
module and may not even be loaded and you can't just call selectkeymap(),
I have no idea how to get this to work. And which keymap should set +o
vi select?
