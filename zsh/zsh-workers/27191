I've missed the beginning of the discussion, so excuse me if I restate
some points...

I would agree with that for non-interactive shells (that is zsh
interpreting a script).  However not resetting at least the terminal
signals (INT, QUIT, TTIN, TTOU, TSTP, CONT, HUP) to their default
settings (SIG_IGN) for interactive sessions could expose you to a lot
of trouble.

Please enligthen me on this one...
