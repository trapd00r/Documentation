I tend to think mixing in directories should be the default.  It can be a
little confusing otherwise if you aren't familiar with the system.

By the way, you do know about the _next_tags widget?  If you bind it, you
can use that key for swapping between files and directories.  I don't know
if it will still allow you switch to globbed files, then directories if the
default changes, but that would be useful.
