} I do not commit it for two reasons:

}  - I'd like to know, that it does not break some other system

On RH5.2, I get:

[...]
checking for library containing yp_all... -lnsl
checking for library containing inet_aton... none required
checking for library containing inet_pton... none required
checking for library containing inet_ntop... none required
checking for library containing gethostbyname2... none required
checking for library containing socket... none required
[...]
checking for gethostname... yes
checking for gethostbyname2... yes
checking for getipnodebyname... no
checking for inet_aton... yes
checking for inet_pton... yes
checking for inet_ntop... yes
[...]

The build then proceeds just fine.

}  - I'm trapped on my own system. The problem is, now, when
} gethostbyname2 is correctly found, name resolution goes via resolver
} library. But this is using /etc/hosts only as fallback "if nameserver
} is not running" (at least in original bind implemetation as found
} here). Due to our infrastructure, it is unacceptable to me.

I'm not sure I understand ... do you mean that your nameserver *is*
running, but is not able to properly resolve all the names you need?
