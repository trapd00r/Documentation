Thanks. Sorry, I see now that that is documented.

I've updated from cvs, rebuilt with debug enabled, removed the
spurious "/" and tried again. This time it works. Thanks.

By the way, the documented feature that accepting a line does not save
region_highlight doesn't appear to work. For me, the variable and the
highlights are persisting.

I had to add a call to "zle -R" so that it doesn't wait till the end of
the widget to display the highlight but otherwise, that seems to work.
An additional key typed in less than a second will remove the
highlighting but that's actually fine. I've included the full function
below in case anyone else wants to play with it: handle quoting or
forward searching perhaps.

Yes, that would be another solution.

local i nested=1
typeset -A match
match=(
  \) \(
  \" \"
  \' \'
  \] \[
  \} \{
)
zle self-insert
for ((i=$(( $CURSOR - 1));i;i--)) {
  [[ $BUFFER[$i] = $match[$KEYS] ]] && (( ! --nested )) && break
  [[ $BUFFER[$i] == $KEYS ]] && (( nested++ ))
}
region_highlight=("$((i-1)) $i standout")
zle -R
read -kt 1 && zle -U "$REPLY"
region_highlight=()
