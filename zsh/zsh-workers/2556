OK, it did exacly that...

So I let it configure...

Well, NOW something changed !

Up to *-test1 configure dids assume we HAVE FIFOS,
BUT NOW IT SAYS WE HAVE NO(!) FIFOS in the *-test2 !

Its on the same machine (sun-sparc-10) same system (Solaris 2.4)
in the same source-tree (I found it by doing:
1) unpacking *3.0.1.tar.gz
2) then patching
3) configure --enable-etcdir=...
4) DOING: cd ..; diff -b -r -c zsh*-test? | less

I tried to compare with a *3.0.2-test1 generated by unpacking, patching,
configuring, THEN APPLYING THE THREE PATCHES FROM THE LIST, then
reconfiguring.  I was intrested how much the tree patches of the list
did differ from the *-test2. AND THEN I WAS SUPRIZED !!!

Any ideas how our FIFOs got lost ?
