^E is my playground binding as I personally use the end key,
anyway. Production use will be ^X. Let's switch over to ^X in the
following emails to stick with the standard binding key.

Ideally, I would want the keybinding for ^X to be executed each and
every time a keybinding starting with ^X is called. But ZLE should
still listen for another key.
I.e. both the widget for ^X and ^Xn are executed when I press ^Xn
a single time.

See above. I hope I was able to express what I meant in a better
way, this time.

Neat!

Yah, that is what I planned on using in case my idea of double-bound
keys does not work out.

I thought about this some more and I will most likely end up using
^X^X for the description widget.


Thanks for your input!
