Subject: Does zsh have an equivalent to the shopt command ?
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1; format=flowed
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Content-Disposition: inline

zsh chokes on this line in a script:

shopt -s extglob

Is there an alternative for use in zsh ?

Thanks
