Subject: PATCH: zsh-3.1.5-pws-9, TRAPZERR fix for new completion
Date: Sat, 20 Feb 1999 22:47:31 PST
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain

We probably want to defeat TRAPZERR within the new
completion stuff.  Mine just prints "That didn't work",
which isn't desirable during completion.

I'm not sure about the other special functions.

  # An entry for `-first-' is the replacement for `compctl -T'
  # Completion functions may set `COMPSKIP' to any value to make the 
  # main loops stop calling other completion functions.
