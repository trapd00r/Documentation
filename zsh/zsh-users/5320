The easiest solution would probably be to change the two functions to
use the same last-search variable instead of two different ones.  The
only downside to this is if someone out there uses both search functions
and enjoys having a different search default in each one.  I personally
see no problem with combining them.

I'm not sure what you mean here.  Type Ctrl-R twice and it will start a
new search with the previous search string.
