Whichever way is fine, as long as I can get it; wget not working is
a minor annoyance, but lynx will still get the file.

But seeing how often people are referred to a "pws" interim release
on the grounds that it is less buggy and more featureful than 3.1.6
makes me wonder if the "point" releases are too infrequent.  It is
the unstable/development tree, after all.
