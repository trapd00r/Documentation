While the problem described above was not rare, since I modified
the script in the following way (two months ago), I can no longer
see the problem.

-{ svn "$@"; st=$?; echo "svnwrapper:term" >&2 } 2>>(filter)
+{
+  svn "$@"
+  st=$?
+  [[ $st -eq 141 ]] && echo "Exit with status 141!" >&2
+  echo "svnwrapper:term" >&2
+} 2>>(filter)

So, either the problem has been fixed somewhere or it can no longer
be seen due to the change in my script. In the latter case, it is
probably a bug in zsh. I'm going to revert this change and see if
I can see the problem again...
