:Looks like we need some noalwayslastprompt guinea pigs for that one.

We differ from other shells in that we have a clear workspace
under the prompt line.  Apply the patch and try the following
with and without alwayslastprompt.

% clear; ls; echo "\e[0H"; ls

This depends slightly on the file listing but you should get an
idea.  My preference is for the current arrangement and I have
noalwayslastprompt - adding the patch may spawn another setopt
value: gimmeaclearworkspace :-)
