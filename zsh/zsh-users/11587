There doesn't appear to be.  First impressions (using a (further) enhanced
_complete_debug setup for _generic which I'll post when the interface is a
bit smoother) suggest this is for some quite deep reason---I can see the
file matcher correctly getting the file-sort style the second time, so my
best guess is that in the core code it's spotting that you have the same
list of matches and not using the newly sorted form.  However, I'm not sure
about that.
