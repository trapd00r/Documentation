} 
} Slashes in a prefix probably wouldn't work.  If you want a better safe
} character, use "|" or ";"; leave "," alone.

Too late; configure already uses comma as the sed separator character.
(And now that I look, it doesn't even bother to protect it in case it
appears in the transform.)  I chose comma *because* configure already
was using it.
