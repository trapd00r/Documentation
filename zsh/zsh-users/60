I would like to know if there is any way (e.g. an undocumented
feature or a source code patch) in zsh to access the full
command line passed to a function or alias. For example, if
'foo' is a function, and I type

	foo "blah blah $$" $XYZ

I'd like to (inside 'foo') have access to the string '"blah blah $$" $XYZ'
as it was typed.

Any suggestions would be appreciated..

thanks
