After playing some more and a couple of SEGVs later...

There is so much mucking around curhist (and histline) in zle that I
wonder if there is a clean way (other than changing the meaning of
curhist in the core and then adapting zle).

Maybe we should just make `print -s' put the strings added while zle
is active into some list and then add those strings only after zle is
left? I.e. in a toplevel-loop() or somewhere around that.


Bye
 Sven
