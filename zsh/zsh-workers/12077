Sorry, I was out of reach for a few days...

Most of the issues are fixed by Clints patches.  Thanks!

Hm, it does append the slash, but then I only get a beep. :-(

I fully agree with you, if completion after sub/.. still works.  But
actually in that case I would expect zsh to offer me _all_ the files in
that directory.  Hm, that's probably the same issue as whether completion
after = or + should only list the .muttrc-defined mailboxes or whether it
should list all files under ~/Mail.  I'd prefer both...in separate groups.

Nope, "cus" is short for "cusanus" and is just a name. :-)

Thanks,
 Andy.
