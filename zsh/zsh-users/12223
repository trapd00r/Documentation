a few people who saw the first release of my zshrc saw the latest version 
of my command prompt during kiwicon and suggested that the changes and 
updates were worth re-posting...

 	http://smasher.org/zsh/

one person at kiwicon (i'll withhold names to protect the geeky) saw what 
i was doing on my laptop, installed zsh & mrxvt, and reported that his 
whole world immediately changed. YMMV.

there are security fixes in this version that supersede all previous 
versions. if you're using any version prior to this, i suggest updating.

if you're considering converting to zsh also check out these:
