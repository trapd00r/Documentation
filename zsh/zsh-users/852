I am using zsh 3.0.0 with gjb's patch for colored tab-completion
(thanks gjb!!!) on Solaris using emacs keys...

Playing around with xemacs -nw the other day, I realized that I would
like the same selection highlight that it provides in zsh.

So, what I want is, when I am editing a command line and hit
control-space to start a selection, as I move around I would like the
selection to be highlighted in reverse-screen.

Has anyone looked in to this? Anyone want to tackle it, or point me in
the right direction?

TIA,
RoLanD
