Sorry for the typo. I should have written one of the following (form one is 
default for tab-completion): 
 
  cd Shell \Scripts\ / 
or  
  cd "Shell Scripts " 
 
I was seeing the problem on solaris 2.5.1/2.5 but when I switched to a 2.6 
machine the problem disappered, so maybe this is a bug in the old Solaris 
shared libraries rather than Zsh. 
 
Thanks, 
pascal
