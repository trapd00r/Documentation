Actually, this is a good point and I don't think any of the clever
exec stuff should ever be done in a subshell (if forked is set in
execcmd()).  This includes the SHLVL decrement since if you're
exec'ing a command in subshell you should presumably still `see' the
level of the parent shell.  Feel free to find some weird exceptions.
