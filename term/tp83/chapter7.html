<H1 CLASS="chapterhead">VT125 Graphics Terminal</H1>
<H2>Overview</H2>
<P>The VT125 Graphics Terminal combines a bit map graphics architecture and the versatile
alphanumeric features of the VT100 Video Terminal. It is designed for use in business
graphics, and laboratory and scientific applications. As a financial analysis or business
data tool, the VT125 is capable of plotting trend lines, bar charts and pie charts. In
engineering laboratory applications, it can be used for point plot graphs, and strip
charts. To support programs written for the VT105, the VT125 includes a VT105
emulator.</P>
<P>The VT125 is a microprocessor-based terminal that directly executes Digital's
general-purpose graphics descriptor, ReGIS (Remote Graphics Instruction Set). ReGIS allows
the creation and storage of pictorial data as simple ASCII text. ReGIS is designed for
efficient communication of graphics data to remote displays.</P>
<P>As a companion product to the VT125 terminal, Digital offers the Letterprinter 100
(<A HREF="chapter10.html">Chapter 10</A>), the LA50 Personal Printer
(<A HREF="chapter12.html">Chapter 12</A>), or the DECwriter Correspondent
(<A HREF="chapter13.html">Chapter 13</A>). Together, the terminal and printer provide you
with a complete graphics package that is both powerful and easy to use.</P>
<P>Currently available models of the VT125 include:</P>

</DL>
<H2>Major Features</H2>
<P>The following features are unique to the VT125 Graphics Terminal:</P>
<DL>
<DT>Universal VT100 Features</DT>
<DD>The VT125 terminal incorporates all of the basic
VT100 features. These features are described in detail in <A HREF="chapter5.html">Chapter
5</A>.</DD>
<DT>Bit Map Graphics Architecture</DT>
<DD>The bit map architecture of the VT125 allows you
to display many things that are difficult or impossible to display on an ordinary CRT,
such as pie charts, bar graphs, trend lines, and special symbols. In graphics mode each
pixel on the screen is controlled by bit map memory which is manipulated under program
control.</DD>
<DT>Screen Resolution 768 by 240 Pixels</DT>
<DD>The VT125 display is made up of 240 rows
by 768 dots. These dots (picture elements or pixels) can be controlled individually by
your applications' programs.</DD>
<DT>Two Full Graphics Planes</DT>
<DD>This feature allows the terminal to display images
one at a time; two at a time, for comparison; or together to achieve varying shades of
gray or color.</DD>
<DT>VT105 Emulation Mode</DT>
<DD>The VT125 Graphics Terminal will support software written
for a VT105 Terminal. This saves the time and expense of converting existing VT105
programs to ReGIS.</DD>
<DT>Auxiliary Port</DT>
<DD>This feature allows for the connection of any EIA auxiliary
device to the VT125. The primary purpose of this port is to connect a Letterprinter 100,
LA50 Personal Printer, or DECwriter Correspondent printer for hardcopy of the image on
the VT125 screen. The auxiliary port can communicate with the auxiliary device in 7- or
8-bit ASCII and is capable of communicating at one of four baud rates &#8211; 300, 1200,
2400, or 9600. The EIA RS-232-C port is bidirectional.</DD>
<DT>Color Output for RGB Monitor</DT>
<DD>This feature allows you to get color output when
using the VT125. The VT125 has the capability of displaying 64 colors, four at a time on
the color monitor.</DD>
<DT>ReGIS firmware</DT>
<DD>ReGIS firmware provides the ability for direct execution of
ReGIS data plotting commands. The firmware interprets simple ASCII text and converts it
into pictures on the video screen using lines, circles, and curves.</DD>
</DL>
<H2>Graphics</H2>
<P>Graphics capabilities in the ReGIS firmware include:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Line drawing with pattern mask definition. Allows a dot-dash pattern to be
superimposed on a designated line.</LI>
<LI>Automatic circle and curve generation.</LI>
<LI>Macrographs to store often-used picture parts in the VT125 memory.</LI>
<LI>Shading algorithms.</LI>
<LI>Text writing and control commands.</LI>
<LI>Screen control commands such as attribute selection and time delay before
execution.</LI>
</UL>
<H2>ReGIS</H2>
<P>ReGIS, a graphic descriptor, is a symbol system that describes the parts of a picture.
A picture (graphic) is the best way to communicate some types of information. A
requirement for a graphic descriptor is to describe the picture with as few symbols as
possible to save storage space and communication line time. ReGIS works by considering a
picture to be a group of graphic objects. Each graphic object is a standard geometric
shape that can be described with a few characters of information. For example, ReGIS
understands that the shape of a circle applies to any circle that can be drawn. A circle
can be described on the screen by the location of its center and a point on its
circumference. The same type of understanding for other graphic objects allows ReGIS to be
a compact descriptor of graphic images.</P>
<P>The VT125 Graphics Option can display 184,320 pixels in a 768-by-240-by-2 array and is
considered a medium resolution device. The Graphic Option memory can store 196,608 pixels
in a 768-by-256-by-2 array. The display of the VT125 is a window that looks into this
memory. The window can move in any direction with a screen command to display all parts of
the pixel memory, or move an object in the image to the center of the display.</P>
<H2>Options</H2>
<P>The VT125 Graphics Terminal is a VT100 text terminal with a factory installed Graphics
Option. Other options are listed below.</P>

<H2>Controls and Indicators</H2>
<P>The VT125 has the same monitor, keyboard, and audible and visual controls and
indicators as other members of the VT100 family. See <A HREF="chapter5.html">Chapter 5</A>
or <CITE>VT125 User Guide</CITE>.</P>
<H2>Operator Features</H2>
<P>All VT100 family members incorporate features that can be selected in set-up.
Set-up features determine how the terminal operates. They allow the terminal to be
configured according to your preference, and provide compatibility to the host and AC
power source. Unlike some terminals, the VT100 family does not use switches or jumpers to
individually turn on or off the built-in features. Instead, these terminals use a
nonvolatile memory (NVR) that always remembers what features have been selected, just as
if a switch had been set.</P>
<H3>Set-Up</H3>
<P>Set-Up mode provides two brief descriptions of the current feature status. Set-Up A
displays the location of the tab stops set in the terminal and a visual ruler that numbers
each character position on the line. The status of other terminal features is summarized
in Set-Up B.</P>
<P>See <A HREF="chapter5.html">Chapter 5</A> for details on entering Set-Up A.</P>
<P>As described in <A HREF="chapter5.html">Chapter 5</A>, Set-Up B mode only can be
entered from Set-Up A Mode. Because the VT125 Graphics Terminal has features not included
with a regular VT100 terminal, Set-Up B has additional features for you to select.</P>
<P>In addition to all the set-up features described in <A HREF="chapter4.html">Chapter
4</A> for the VT100 family, the VT125 has two additional set-up features.</P>
<H4>Aux Port Bits Per Char</H4>
<P>This switch sets the auxiliary port to match the character length of your printer or
other serial device. When set to eight bits, the eighth bit is a space. (This is the same
as 7S or 8N on other vendors' terminals.) <STRONG>Note:</STRONG> Only on VT125.</P>
<H4>Aux Port Speed</H4>
<P>This sets the auxiliary port to one of four baud rates: 300, 1200, 2400, and 9600. Set
the speed to match the speed of your auxiliary device. <STRONG>Note:</STRONG> Only on
VT125.</P>

</TABLE>
<H2>Communications</H2>
<P>The VT125 is a serial line interface video terminal. It communicates asynchronously
over full-duplex lines. All communications features are keyboard-selectable. Transmit
and receive speeds can be set independently at 16 different rates from 50 to 19,200 baud.
An EIA RS232-C compatible interface is standard. A 20&nbsp;mA current loop interface is
optional.</P>
<P>The VT125 Graphics Terminal can be connected to a computer directly or through a
common carrier facility (telephone line). In both applications, either the Electronic
Industry Association (EIA) interface provided with the terminal or the 20&nbsp;mA current
loop interface option are used.</P>
<P>When connecting the terminal to the computer through a telephone line, a modem or
acoustic coupler is needed. The modem or acoustic coupler changes the serial characters
transmitted between terminal and computer into signals that can be transmitted over the
telephone line. Several types of modems can be used with the VT125 terminal. However, the
modem used by the terminal must be compatible with the modem used by the computer.</P>
<H2>Programming Information</H2>
<P>The VT125 Terminal responds to three different programming standards:</P>
<UL>
<LI>In ANSI (American National Standards Institute) mode, the VT125 will support software
based on ANSI standards &#8211; ANSI X3.4-1977, X3.41-1974, X3.64-1979.</LI>
<LI>In VT52 mode, the VT125 Terminal will support software written for use with the
DIGITAL VT52 Video Terminal.</LI>
<LI>In VT105 mode, the VT125 Terminal will respond to software written for the DIGITAL
VT105 Terminal.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Consult <A HREF="appendixd.html">Appendix D</A> or your <CITE>VT125 User Manual</CITE>
for detailed information on escape sequences and sequence formats.</P>
<H2>Maintenance</H2>
<P>The VT125 has an automatic internal self-test that checks the terminal for correct
operation every time the power is turned on. The VT125 is easy to maintain. No
preventative maintenance is necessary. If a repair should be required, Field Service is
available worldwide. The terminal is designed to make machine access and the replacement
of parts fast and easy.</P>
<H3>Self-Test</H3>
<P>The VT125 terminal has several self-tests available for checking the operation of the
terminal.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Power-up self-test</LI>
<LI>Computer port data loopback test</LI>
<LI>Auxiliary port data loopback test</LI>
<LI>Display test</LI>
<LI>Video bit map memory test</LI>
</UL>
<P>To prepare for all the tests except the power-up test, prepare the terminal by first
pressing the power switch to the OFF position. Then disconnect the communications cables
from the computer and auxiliary data ports. Third, if a cable was connected to the EIA
computer port connector, install an EIA loopback connector on the EIA connector. If the
cable was connected to the 20&nbsp;mA connector, then install the loopback connector that
was included with that option. Do not use the EIA loopback connector at the same time as
the current loopback connector. Finally, turn the power switch ON. <STRONG>Note:</STRONG>
To perform auxiliary port tests, consult your <CITE>VT125 User Guide</CITE> for
details.</P>
<H3>Operator Troubleshooting Checklist</H3>
<P>If it appears that there is a problem in the terminal, initiate the power-up self-test
program. This test will help to determine if the problem lies in your terminal or in some
other part of the computer system.</P>
<P><STRONG>Terminal does not respond to typed characters. Keyclicks are generated and
keyboard indicators function.</STRONG></P>
<UL>
<LI>Print operation cannot be completed. Check printer.</LI>
