Thanks for the report.  Is there anyway we can tell that this needs
defining?

I don't have an SGI around and there isn't any suspicious-looking code
in optlookup() (though it has recently changed).  Are you able to
compile with --enable-zsh-debug and see what "name" is being passed to
the last frame ("show name")?  Alternatively, can you see which "setopt"
statement is causing the problem, or does it happen with a lot of
different varieties of statement?
