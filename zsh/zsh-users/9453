    But I use (or will use) throw mainly in scripts, and that makes
the script to exit. And probably the 90% of throw/catch usage will

    But the function will work correctly even without "typeset -g",
wouldn't it? Wouldn't be needed "typeset -g" in "catch" too for the
CAUGHT parameter?

    Thanks a lot for your answer :)
