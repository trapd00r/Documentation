Could be it's not in interactive mode, for some reason.  Do something like
  [[ -o zle ]] && print "zle is not running"
to check.

This isn't a cygwin-aware port, so far as I know, so it may not realise
(for reasons which would be far beyond my knowledge of Windows) that the
xterm is connected to a terminal.

If you want a more consistent environment, I'd suggest getting 3.1.9 (or
3.1.9-dev-2 from the development directory on the archive, which has a few
bug fixes but few other changes) and compiling it directly under cygwin.
I haven't tried it under an xterm, but normal operation under cygwin is fine.
