I thought your problem was that you were running stuff in different
shells or subshells or something.  However, as you're not, it seems
likely you're running across a bug:

2004-06-08  Peter Stephenson  <pws@pwstephenson.fsnet.co.uk>

	* 20029: Src/Modules/mathfunc.c: rand48(seed) stopped being
	random after the second call.

That was fixed a while ago, however; it should even be in the current 4.2.x
version.
