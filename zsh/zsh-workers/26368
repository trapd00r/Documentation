The keymap is a good thing, but I suspect the reasons no one's bothered
before include (1) accept-search is no different than undefined-key in
this context, (2) if the keymap exists, it's possible to do something
moderately stupid like "bindkey -A main isearch", and (3) the *real*
oomph would come if user-defined widgets were usable in isearch mode
(and the widgets in that mode had distinct names).

You'd also have to define it with "zle -N" in that case, though, and
there follows the confusion as to why your custom widget doesn't get
called when the accept-search key is struck in isearch mode.
