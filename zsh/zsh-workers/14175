I haven't actually looked to see what changes Bram put into 6.0ad, but he
was talking about determining if vim was attached to a terminal by checking
to see if stderr was attached to the terminal.

Each case here where the output is missing you've sent stderr somewhere
other than the terminal, and so vim figures it can't print.

There really ought to be a better way to get this information -- all three
standard fds can be redirected, but the program can still be running in a
terminal, no?
