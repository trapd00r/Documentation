Subject: pipe issues with 'jobs' command

Hi,

I noticed that the jobs command does not pipe at all,
in fact, creating a pipe seems to just make the output
disappear.  But will redirect to output file still
works (of course not in conjunction with pipe).  See
below:

--------------------------------
le_rhat_pc% jobs
[1]  + running    usr/bin/xemacs
le_rhat_pc% jobs > output.txt
le_rhat_pc% cat output.txt
[1]  + running    usr/bin/xemacs
le_rhat_pc% jobs | cat
le_rhat_pc% jobs > output.txt | cat
le_rhat_pc% cat output.txt
le_rhat_pc% echo `jobs`

le_rhat_pc% echo $(jobs)

le_rhat_pc%
le_rhat_pc% uname -a
Linux le_rhat_pc 2.4.7-6 #1 Wed Aug 29 11:43:50 EDT
2001 i686 unknown
le_rhat_pc% echo $ZSH_VERSION
4.0.4
--------------------------------

Pretty weird, eh?

thanks.

p.s. I'm new to zsh and the zsh list so I appologize
if this is a FAQ or has already been answered
recently.
