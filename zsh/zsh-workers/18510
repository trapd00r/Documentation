It does give the user a way of testing whether zsh has really gone into
UTF8 mode, however --- otherwise, how do you know if --disable-multibyte
wasn't used for compilation owing to a buggy library, or whatever?
Hence I was thinking of the same thing.  (Whether it's a good idea to
have it override the internal check for UTF8 is quite another question.)
