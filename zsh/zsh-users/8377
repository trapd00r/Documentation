Motoi,
	Thanks so much for putting these (and other Darwin) completions 
together.  Could I make a small feature request for the _defaults 
completion?  Sometimes I use defaults(1) to read plist files which 
aren't part of a registered domain.  For example:

defaults read /Applications/TextEdit.app/Contents/Info

will normally display the contents of 
/Applications/TextEdit.app/Contents/Info.plist

If I use the _defaults completion, this doesn't work (and neither does 
TAB completion: 'defaults read /App<TAB>').  Could _defaults be 
modified to allow for viewing of xml files which aren't registered as a 
defaults domain?  I'd love to help but haven't been able to get the 
hang of writing completions yet.

Thanks,
Ryan
