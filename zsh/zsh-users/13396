You might want to use "bindkey -L" since it outputs it in the form of the
command you need to set things up again, so it's easy to grab a command for
future use.

See the zshcontrib manual page: the function edit-command-line does
what you want.  zshcontrib describes a whole load of add ons that are
implemented as shell functions so aren't part of the core zle stuff.

autoload -Uz edit-command-line
zle -N edit-command-line
bindkey -M vicmd 'v' edit-command-line

By the way, if you're confused about where to look in the manual, there's
a new "zshroadmap" page that should give some pointers.

Wow, that's certainly a change.
