Since this doesn't work as-is, I'm backing it out and will probably
do sed substitutions on Config/version.mk as needed.

-Version Suffixes
-----------------
-The configure script reads the version number from Config/version.mk.
-If the environment variable ZSH_VERSIONSUFFIX is set, the string
-contained therein will be appended to the version string.  For example,
-if Config/version.mk contains "VERSION=4.3.4-dev-7" and
-ZSH_VERSIONSUFFIX is set to "-ca", $ZSH_VERSION in the shell built from
-that run will equal "4.3.4-dev-7-ca".  Caution is recommended when
-using this feature, as is-at-least may misunderstand your conventions.
