It's zany, sure.  I'm tempted to suggest a special non-existent file 
qualifier, which would expand to files that don't exist, which you could then 
use in this context, but that's probably a bit expensive if you use it in any 
other context.  And a special combination qualifier of ./=%p is probably not 
useful enough to add either.  So Bart's solution is probably as simple as it's 
going to get.
