I dislike the history-search-Xward functions too. Luckily, there's:
history-beginning-search-backward (and ...-forward)
which does exactly the desired thing.

That's because zsh by default considers "/" to be part of a word instead of a 
separator (defined in the WORDCHARS parameter). I remove "/" in my .zshrc:
WORDCHARS=${WORDCHARS//\/}
This also causes backward-word etc. to stop on "/".

hope this helps,

Christian
