No.

It's not quoted, but it's also not the start of a word.  "Word" here has
the very specific meaning of a shell-parser syntactic word, which means
that a word "starts" only immediately after an unquoted $IFS character, or
(as a special case) after a colon found to the right of the equal sign in
certain assignment expressions.
