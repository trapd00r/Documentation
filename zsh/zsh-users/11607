} The command "newgrp <group>" starts up a shell with a different default

There's an easier way.  Outside the "for" loop, do:

chgrp biostat .
chmod g+s .

Now all files created below the current directory will inherit the group
of the current directory, provided that the user who creates the file is
a member of the biostat group.  Also the "g+s" mode will be inherited by
any directories created within the current directory.
