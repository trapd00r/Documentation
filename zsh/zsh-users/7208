Thanks, but I'd like to keep a one line prompt (that's the main reason
for using rprompt at all) and I'd like to use rprompt because it
already does everything I want (except the thing I mentioned).

Customising your prompt so that it works like rprompt plus the "[...]"
would require zsh skills beyond mine.
