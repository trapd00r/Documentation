Under the assumption that we carry through and cause the emulation
mode or possibly other options to be automatically saved/restored
for any functions defined in the emulate scope, the effect is going
to be quite similar to that of setting LOCAL_OPTIONS globally.

Consequently I think it makes little difference whether -L/-c are
mutually exclusive; I'm OK with it either way.

That's an interesting one.  Yes, I could envision a case where one may
want to have a local $argv in the emulate scope.

I think so.

} If you are defining function in a *zsh* script, why not simply define it 
} as *zsh* function?

    emulate sh
    # ...
    emulate zsh -c "${$(<<\HERE
    function ...
    HERE)}"
    # ...

Yeah, that's a bit contrived.
