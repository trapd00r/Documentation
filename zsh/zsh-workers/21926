+Program name transformation:
+  --program-prefix=PREFIX           # prepend PREFIX to installed name
+  --program-suffix=SUFFIX           # append SUFFIX to installed name
+  --program-transform-name=SEDSCR   # run sed script SEDSCR on installed name
+
+Note that zsh interprets this standard feature of configure to mean that the
+program will be run from the installed location.  For example, with
+the argument --program-suffix=-dev is given, the file zsh-dev will be
+installed and all references to it will be adjusted accordingly.  If
+the program is to be created in some temporary directory for installation
+elsewhere, set DESTDIR to the top-level directory of the temporary
+hierarchy.
