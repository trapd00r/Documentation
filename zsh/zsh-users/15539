I was able to reproduce this by setting the zstyle:

zstyle ':completion:*' accept-exact true

That style isn't 'true' by default.  If you set it intentionally, it 
sounds like you don't actually want it.  If something at the system 
level sets it up, you can override it by adding:

zstyle ':completion:*' accept-exact false

somewhere in your startup scripts (e.g. ~/.zshrc).

You can test that it's currently set by looking at the output of:

zstyle -L ':completion:*'
