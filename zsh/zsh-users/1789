Quoting Bart Schaefer (schaefer@brasslantern.com):

Actually, I tried just that - but I figured that it would not work
as there is no directories /etc on Windows systems.  :-/

Well, how could I be sure?  Actually, I find that using "zshrc" would
be a nice workaround because of the "8.3" filename convention.

I'd rather look into a manual explaining this.  (hint hint ;-)

I understand that the following "filenames" should work then:

        %HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%/.zshrc
        %HOME%/.zshrc
        %ZDOTDIR%/.zshrc

Now, which order do these take?  Amol?
