A matter of replacing `shout' in several places with the pipe. But
then there is the issue of starting the external command... And what
to do with menu-selection? And the terminal codes used by complist?

Oh my, and I only asked if it would be better to mention the number of 
lines needed for the list when asking if it should be displayed... ;-)

And noone has answered that yet (unless Andrej meant that it would be
better).
