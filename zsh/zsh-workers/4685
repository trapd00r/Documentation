In section 2.3 of the new FAQ, the first example of the zsh function for
cd is missing the closing double-quotes:
 cd() { builtin cd "$@; echo $PWD; }

As a thought: Bart pointed out $==* as an alternative to "$@" (one would
almost think he wanted to free up the syntax for something else :^) ...
perhaps mention of this in the FAQ in section 3.1 would be appropriate,
and perhaps mention in the table in 2.3(5), comments section.  I think
the point was more that $* was not always correct and relying on
defaults is a bad idea.  Mentioning both together seems to be one of
those hints that might make the concept of the expansion flags 'click'
in the user's mind.
