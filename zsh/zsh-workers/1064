Is anyone planning to add an option that will strip trailing and unquoted
extra spaces from zle input?  If not, I'd appreciate a hint how best to
go about it.  I think I would like to add the stripping to the zleread()
function, but I'm not sure what functions are available to help me find
the next token on the line so that I only eliminate superfluous spaces.
