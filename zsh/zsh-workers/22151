It's not zed, you can see it just by entering

fctest () {
        cat <<< 'foo
bar'
}
which fctest

The argument from a here string is output in a slightly strange way.  The
only reason I can see is for just the case you have, when it's been input
as a here document.  In that case it's a raw string and needs quoting.  I
think that's OK; it's the other case that needs changing.  As far as I
know, we never get there directly from a here document since that shouldn't
produce tokens, so it should be good enough just to output that as a normal
string without the extra layer of quoting.  However, there may be a case
I've missed...
