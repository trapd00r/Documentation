As Oliver indicated, the people who run the mailing list don't usually
read it but he will ask them to run qconfirm so that automatically sent
messages from people not subscribed won't appear on the list.

However, it's odd that this list is so badly affected.  If it means
there are now plenty of Windows users using zsh, then it's possible some
of the viruses actually came from people who *are* subscribed.
