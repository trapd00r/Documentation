Ah, I see. Sorry.

Yes, adding a heap of extra states a la `extract_file_or_directory_entry'
is ugly.

Hm, some form of `case' that executes all matching branches would be
useful here.

(Yes, I know that one can do that e.g. with a `case' in a loop where
the case branches remove substrings from the `state' name, but that
isn't exactly a nice solution, either.)

Bye
 Sven
