I intended to use that for _cvs.  Since valid options are quite
different before and after non-option first argument, it is trouble
that _arguments in _tst1 and _cvs completes options over non-option
first argument.  If _arguments behaves so, _cvs completes global
options for subcommands as:

Z(2):akr@is27e1u11% cvs add -<TAB>
option
--allow-root      --help-options    -H   -a   -e   -l   -q   -t   -x 
--help            --help-synonyms   -Q   -b   -f   -m   -r   -v   -z 
--help-commands   --version         -T   -d   -k   -n   -s   -w      

Options except `-k' and `-m' are global options and they are only
valid between `cvs' and `add'.

So, I think following behaviour is also problem.

is27e1u11% _tst () { _arguments '-a' '*::rest:(rest)' }
is27e1u11% tst arg -<TAB>
->
is27e1u11% tst arg -a

Because I think _arguments shouldn't completes options after an
argument handled by `*::message:action'.
