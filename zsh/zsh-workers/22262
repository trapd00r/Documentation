OK, thanks, that example now works, but unfortunately the saga
continues... this still fails:

% fn() { local IFS=.-; print -l ${=1:-$ZSH_VERSION}; }
% fn
4.3.0-dev-3

which should also be split since $ZSH_VERSION isn't quoted.  (This one's
from is-at-least, too:  it seems running "is-at-least 4.0" is a good test
of word splitting.)  I presume this is due to the truly horrible
argument passing back from the lower levels.
