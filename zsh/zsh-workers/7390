Subject: 3.1.6-pws-1 available
Date: Fri, 06 Aug 1999 17:53:50 +0200
From: Peter Stephenson <pws@ibmth.df.unipi.it>

I've uploaded 3.1.6-pws-1 to
http://www.ifh.de/~pws/computing/zsh-3.1.6-pws-1.tar.gz
(there are no other files this time).

It contains the new pattern code described in my last message (sorry,
didn't get around to putting that into the Changelog in time).

I'm now going away for three weeks; for the first two I shall probably not
be reading my email.  But nothing's going to go wrong.

Here are the recent changes.

1999-08-06  Peter Stephenson  <pws@ibmth.df.unipi.it>

	* pws: Config/version.mk: 3.1.6-pws-1 made available.

	* Sven: 7386: Src/subst.c: Order of q and Q parameter flags matters.

1999-08-05  Peter Stephenson  <pws@ibmth.df.unipi.it>

	* Sven: 7380: Src/hist.c, Src/subst.c, Doc/Zsh/expn.yo: flag X for
	  reporting errors de-quoting.

	* Sven: 7374: Src/subst.c, Doc/Zsh/expn.yo: modifier to remove one
	  level of quotation, corresponding flags.

	* Sven: 7373: Src/Zle/comp.h, Src/Zle/zle_tricky.c,
	  Completion/Base/_brace_parameter:  support nested parameter
	  expansion type of deal.

1999-08-04  Peter Stephenson  <pws@ibmth.df.unipi.it>

	* Sven: 7355: Src/Zle/compctl.c, Src/Zle/zle_tricky.c: make
	  compadd quoting consistent with compgen.	

1999-08-02  Peter Stephenson  <pws@ibmth.df.unipi.it>

	* Sven: 7349: Src/loop.c, Src/signals.c:  restore errflags in
	  select after a zleread; fix problem restoring function-style trap
	  after a function set it to something else.

	* Sven: 7348: Completion/Core/_path_files, Doc/Zsh/compsys.yo:
	  remove path_keepdir configuration key but don't do keepdir
	  trick unless _files had no type arguments.

	* Sven: 7345, 7346, 7347: Src/Zle/zle_tricky.c: match control
	  problems.

	* Sven: 7344, 7353: Src/cond.c, Src/Modules/example.c,
	  Src/Zle/compctl.c, Util/zsh-development-guide:  conditions can
	  get the tokenized string; better quoting behaviour in
	  IPREFIX/ISUFFIX.

	* Sven: 7343: Src/Zle/zle_tricky.c: quote path prefix and suffix
	  earlier.

	* pws: 7342: Doc/Makfile.in: use makeinfo ... || exit 0 to
	  ignore result of makeinfo.

	* Irving Wolfe: 7336: utils.c: same fcntl() change.

	* Geoff: 7335: init.c: third argument for fcntl().
