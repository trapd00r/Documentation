Subject: Should _long_options be considered dangerous?
X-Mailer: VM 6.68a under Emacs 20.3.5.1
Reply-To: Bart Schaefer <schaefer@brasslantern.com>

I wonder if perhaps we shouldn't add some more warning text in
Completion/Base/_long_options (and maybe even in Completion/README)
noting that you shouldn't attempt to use _long_options from _normal
or any other "default" completion function.

Some (non-GNU) commands might actually do something unpleasant when
run with an unrecognized --help option.  I can't think of an example
offhand, which is why the Subject is a question, but ...
