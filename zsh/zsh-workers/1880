I'd prefer a different fix.  I think it is better to parse each command
substitution lexically and if it consists of a single redirection to stdin
than behave as $(< file) behaves now.  This is really preferrable since $(<
file command) should execute the given command.  That's the ksh behaviour
and that's what required by POSIX.  I'll try to write a patch for that.
