It's quite correct to assign a value to PROMPT et al. in ~/.zshrc.
Just don't mark it as "export".

The use of "export PS1" is sensible in the old Bourne shell and in a
strictly POSIX shell, because there is no file that is read by every
interactive shell (only ~/.profile read by login shells).  It doesn't
make sense in bash or zsh, because ~/.*shrc can set it and the various
replacements (like zsh's %m and bash's \h for the machine name) are not
compatible anyway, if you happen to start up some other shell.
