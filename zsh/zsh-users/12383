Subject: Zsh - push current command on history without executing it



Hi..I was reading the zsh manual and trying to
figure out how to push the current command line
into the history list wihout actually executing
the command.

push-line does almost what I want, but it pops
the command back into view after I issue the next
command. What I'm looking for is something like
push-history..  but I can't find it. Is there
such a thing or any way to make zsh do something
like that?

Thanks.

Casper
