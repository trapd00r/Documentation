Not at present.

One problem you're eventually going to run into, probably when you least
want to, is the environment not permitting enough space to pass all the
(expanded-30%-by-base64) text in the killring through it.  Finding a
secure place to pass it through a file is probably most foolproof, even
if you have to gpg the file or something.
