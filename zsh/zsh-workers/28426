} I can see that if you interpret the word "OFFSET" literally it's
} different from a subscript and you might interpret it as starting
} from 0 in any case. I still think on balance consistency with normal
} subscripting is preferable.

I agree that consistency wth normal subscripting is preferable, but
subscripting behaves like a pair of offsets only when KSH_ARRAYS is
set (hence the second alternative I suggested).

However, I'm mostly indifferent.

} I don't think half-measures compatibility with other shells is
} particularly useful, in the end is probably more confusing when you
} find some things work the way you expect and some things don't.

I'm confused about how that relates to the foregoing, sorry ...?

Thanks for the additional patch.
