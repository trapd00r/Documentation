I'd certainly like to see this included, along with other stuff from ksh93
unless it's obviously stupid.  The question is when to do it:  we have been
planning a neatening up of the parameter setting code, which hasn't got an
interface so much as a backend which happens to include a few functions
callable from outside.  That would probably be a necessary prerequisite for
any attempt at another ksh feature, the ability to tie getting and setting
of parameters to shell functions.
