Not necessarily; what I used to used to use my .netrc for was automating
logins to anonymous ftp servers, where you password is your e-mail
address, and not exactly sensitive information :)  But if you use ftp very
much, I highly recommend installing ncftp, which you can find on
ftp.probe.net, in /pub/ncftp.  It automatically maintains the equivalent
of a .netrc (although it doesn't record passwords for non-anonymous sites
:).

For hosts that you have an account on, you can create a .rhosts file
(caution:  this can be a security risk; RTFM before trying).  This will
allow you to retrieve files with rcp, and login automatically with rlogin.
