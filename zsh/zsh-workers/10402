Subject: Re: zrecompile


I forgot:

zrecompile probably makes a whole lot more sense when used with the -p 
option, because then it also catches new functions in directories.

Maybe we should make that the default and the automatic zwc file
searching only be done when given some option.

Bye
 Sven
