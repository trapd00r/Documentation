It doesn't know anything about curses, nor termcap, and there are a whole
load of different implementations which might be linked in, as we've been
seeing recently.  So there's no simple way of knowing whether TERMINFO is
relevant at all.

I suppose there's nothing to stop us doing some more
implementation-specific probing, now we have separate termcap and terminfo
modules, and shovelling some extra code into those, linking in the
appropriate version when necessary (echotc and echoti already depend on the
respective modules).
