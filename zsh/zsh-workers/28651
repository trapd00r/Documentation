I wouldn't call BeOS "minor". It might have had a limited diffusion, but =

At least you didn't mention Haiku in the list :)

As for Windows, its audience is certainly not minor, despite not having =
the favors of real hackers (except as a target for study). :)

Indeed, this would probably work in BeOS in Haiku. But I agree it looks =
overkill.
