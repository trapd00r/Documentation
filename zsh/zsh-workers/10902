Subject: 3.1.7-pre-1: fignore is mishandled by _files
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

_path_files attempts to use $fignore, but only if no -g options were passed.
However, _files *always* passes a -g option to _path_files, so in the one
case where one might expect fignore to work without extra configuration --
default file completions -- it fails to do so.
