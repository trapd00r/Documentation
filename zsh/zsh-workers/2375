| Subject: Bug in zsh v3.0-pre3
| Paul,
| 	I just recently found a bug in zsh. Following is what happened;
| 
| comnet2 [/users/hellstrm] Tue 12 10:13am {hellstrm} %                   @qe
| comnet2 [/users/hellstrm] Tue 12 10:13am {hellstrm} % ypcat passwd | awk
| -F":" '{print $1 "" $5}'
|                   ^ - Cursor was here.
| 
| # I then inserted a tab.
| 
| 
| comnet2 [/users/hellstrm] Tue 12 10:13am {hellstrm} % ypcat passwd | awk
| -F":" '{print $1 "BUG: 0 <= wb <= cs <= we is not true!
| 
| 
| That's all that happened. I can re-create it very easily, even on new
| shells. I gather it would have something to do with the double quotes
| within the single quotes.

I don't maintain zsh anymore; you should send this bug report
to zsh-workers@math.gatech.edu.

  Sharp, stabbing pains in the chest or stomach: These are usually
caused by being stabbed in the chest or stomach with a sharp object,
but it could be something worse.
  Dull, aching pains in the head: These are usually caused by a
headache.  Often, you can cure yourself merely by being irritable; if
that doesn't work, you may need aspirin or brain surgery.
  Vomiting: This is usually caused by eating clams.
