I assumed it was for the function and judging by the ChangeLog it must be
because in the first mention of _mere it is commited with mere.

I'm not sure that it should be _ps_utils because the psutils is a single
package of utilities distributed together which has always been called psutils
in one word. _ps_utils might imply that some other unrelated PostScript utility
should go in there also. Keeping it _mysql_utils and renaming to _x_utils is
fine though.

My main reservation about _parse_help is that the function doesn't do the
actual parsing itself, it gets _arguments to do it. That aside, it looks and
sounds better than _options_from__help.

That seems good. The documentation for _call talks about calling a 'command' so
maybe it should be _call_command but program might be clearer.

I agree but I can't think of anything better.

I like the sorting behaviour too but am not particularly convinced by these.
_tag_requested just seems quite long for something which is used a lot. One
option is removing the 'ed' so we just have _tag_want and _tag_request.

Another option which I think I prefer would be to use something like _want_now
or _wanted_now for _requested which groups it with _wanted while possibly
better expressing the difference with _wanted which you were getting at with
the _tag_selected idea.

I'm not sure about the labels. Anyway, I'm being dragged down the pub so I'll
have to finish this reply next week.
