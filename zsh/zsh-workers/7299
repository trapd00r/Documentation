Subject: PATCH: 3.1.6-test-3: less pedantry
Date: Tue, 27 Jul 1999 17:19:29 +0200
From: Peter Stephenson <pws@ibmth.df.unipi.it>

I finally flipped and got bored of gcc -pedantic warnings about `long long'
and variable-sized arrays when compiling with debugging, which seem now to
be more trouble than they're worth.  -pedantic was never supposed to be
useful anyway.

Personally, I always stick in -O2 to the CFLAGS since it makes the
resulting shell more usable and there are more active warnings, but I
suppose I shouldn't inflict that on everybody.
