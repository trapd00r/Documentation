Before zsh issues the PS1 prompt, it clears the line. This has the
effect that
I don't see the last line of the previous command, unless it is
terminated
by a newline. Example:

   perl -e 'print "hello"'

does not show the output "hello", because it is erased immediately by
the shell, but

   perl -e 'print "hello\n"

shows, because the output is terminated by \n.

My setting of PS1 is:  %B%~%b>

Is there a way to tell zsh not to erase the line before writing the
prompt?
