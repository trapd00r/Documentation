Got this to apply with a few bits applied by hand, without creating
any untoward problems as far as I can see.  My first couple of
comments are:

First, the last hunk of the patch deletes

! 1 or -1.  For example,
! 
! nofill(tt(compctl -s '`users`' -x 'n[1,@]' -k hosts -- talk))
! 
! will usually complete usernames, but if you insert an tt(@) after the
! name, names from the array var(hosts) (assumed to contain hostnames,
! though you must make the array yourself) will be completed.  Other
! commands such as tt(rcp) can be handled similarly.

from the manual.  This is a new, and apparently irrelevant, example
just added, so I would guess this is a mistake due to having patched
the old file but not the new.

Second, there seems to be a problem with menucompletion set.  It now
pauses when it gets to an ambiguous completion, and only cycles
through the next time you hit tab --- in other words it seems to have
turned into the normal automenu behaviour.
