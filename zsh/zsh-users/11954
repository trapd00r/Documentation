} Well, actually, it should be handling these correctly. For bold,
} standout and underline.

Hm.  If I do, in my xterm,

% PS1='verylongstring%#%S '

then the entire prompt, including the "verylongstring%", appears in
reverse video.  Are you saying that it's ZLE that's spreading the
standout mode to the left as well as to the right, and not just a
quirk of xterm?

To get what I'd expect, it's necessary to explicitly put in %s at
the beginning of the prompt.

% PS1='%sverylongstring%#%S '

Further, if I type something at that prompt and then backspace over
it, the reverse video gets left behind where the erased characters
used to be.
