jean-luc@picard (ttyp9) ~/zsh> ls <TAB>
URLs        _make       foo/        zsh_a4.ps            =20
jean-luc@picard (ttyp9) ~/zsh> ls

-> URLs and _make are uncoloured, foo/ is green as expected, zsh_a4.ps
is cyan as expected.

Ah. I think the problem is the first few matches that fit in the "normal
file" highlightning. After the first directory name, everything is OK,
before, it isn't.

Tried with this .zshrc:

--------------
setopt autolist
ZLS_COLOURS=3D"no=3D36;40:fi=3D36;40:di=3D32;40:ln=3D36;40:pi=3D31;40:so=3D=

=3D37;41:*=3D36;40"
export ZLS_COLOURS
