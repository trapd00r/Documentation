The old tags were broken (outdated) in git due to my last re-gen of the
git version from cvs where I (alas) didn't re-push the tags.  For anyone
who wants the newest, fixed tags, they'll need to also do a re-clone,
since git does not update tags that it already knows about.

Glad to hear that things are all fixed up.
