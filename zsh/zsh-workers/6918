I've been thinking about this, too. Some kind of autoauto-functions
with arguments describing the tags to expect and what to do with
them. Or some external configuration and then cal autoauto or
whatever. (Heck, haven't I mentioned that yet? I thought I had, but
maybe I've been only thinking too much about it.)

This is even more interesting if we once get into heavy widget-hacking.

What I'm currently thinking about is how we could generalise the
dumping code and integrate it with a generic autoauto function.

Bye
 Sven
