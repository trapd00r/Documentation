Hello:

Sorry if this is a FAQ, but I was wondering if ZSH supports wildcard
characters in the PATH variable.  HP-UX uses this new /opt/package/*
braindead methodology for option packages and thus the binaries and manuals
are all scattered under each of the subdirectories.  It would be nice if
you could do something like this:

PATH=${PATH}:/opt/{ansic,langtools,audio}/bin

or better yet somehow dynamically find all the bin dirs here and add it to
the path in some sort of compact notation like the above.

Thanks,

-Clint
