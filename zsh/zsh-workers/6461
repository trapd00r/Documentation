I certainly don't think we should change it if it's not for completion, you
never know what you're going to break.  But it looks harmless if it is from
completion --- although technically stdin and the editing file descriptor
are different, I can't imagine anyone really expects reading from stdin
during a completion to be useful, so I suppose it's worth doing.

I suppose closing it is better than redirecting it from /dev/null, since
then you get an error message which will warn the user that something
happened which shouldn't have --- although a bit cryptic: cat gives me
  cat: cannot stat 
Are there cases where this is bad?
