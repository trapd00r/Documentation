} I have installed the GNU program screen and set it to use "^q" as it's
} escape character, and disabled its flowcontrol with the following
} options in my .screenrc:
} 	defescape ^Qq
} 	defflow off

Hmm.

Those options are supposedly "useful multiuser sessions only" [sic]  
to change "the default command characters of users that will be added
later."

You should be using
	escape ^Qq
	flow off

I have no idea why running mutt, less, etc. would make any difference,
unless maybe they're aliases that use screen to create new windows.
