Given that, I went ahead and created the patch.  You can pick it up from

	ftp://ftp.brasslantern.com/pub/zsh/patch-3.0.5-ext-2

As suggested by the name, it sets the version string to "3.0.5-ext-2".  I've
removed the "3.0.5-extended" patch.

Relatively complete details of what's included can be found in

	ftp://ftp.brasslantern.com/pub/zsh/README

The very short description is that it contains the patches from zsh-users
articles 1068 and 1880, and from zsh-workers 2864, 3526, 3548, 3598, 3649,
3660, 3680, 3771, 3806, 3809, 3816, 3818, 3872, 3963, 3969, 3974, 4140,
4147, 4148, 4172, 4376, 4397, 4612, 4644, 4677 (2nd hunk only), 4678, 4697,
and 4870.
