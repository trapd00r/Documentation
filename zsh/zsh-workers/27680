I was probably too brief: when I said "reported", I meant "reported
interactively when their state changes".  I was assuming you were trying
to ignore jobs to the extent that if you didn't look at them again, you
wouldn't notice them, which is what turning off "monitor" should do for
you, unless I've missed something.  If you start going looking for them
you'll still find them.  I don't know if that's good enough for your
needs or not.

I can well believe all of this, but it's not clear to me why its
relevant.  If it means you still need job control to work continuously,
then certainly turning off "monitor" isn't an option.
