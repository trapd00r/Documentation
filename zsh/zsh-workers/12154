This is over NFS, right? If so, it is a known problem that some
machines at least don't update the access time there and hence the
test fails.

Either we should make this test in /tmp if that is writable or we
should make it print a warning that it may fail over NFS (and then we
should move the test to the end of 07cond.ztst so that all other tests 
are tried).

Bye
 Sven
