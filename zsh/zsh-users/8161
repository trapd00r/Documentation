    I didn't explained correctly O:)) I want it expanded within the
completion widget, not in the command line. The problem is that the
compadd call doesn't work if the WORD has '~' as the first character.

    I want this:

    $ cd ~X<TAB><TAB>

    X11/    usr/    bin/    include/

    And after that, insert the completions. If I 'translate' PREFIX
so the named dir is expanded, completion works OK, but then I have
the named dir translated in the command line.

    I want to translate it only in the widget so compadd can
correctly generate the list.

    I'll take a look, but my problem is that I don't understand most
of the code. It is not very readable and is quite complex for me O:)
But I'll take a look at _tilde_files. Thanks for the reference.

    Thanks a lot, Bart, I'll take a look at _tilde_files and try to
get the point. Thanks for coming to the rescue again ;)
