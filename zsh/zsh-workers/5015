Is the cursor directly after the Makefile or after a space? I have it
after a space, which is certainly the right thing.

If you have selfinsert bound to space the behaviour should be the one
zsh always had (I think, I don't exactly remember 3.0.5 and I don't
have it anymore, but a 2.6-beta12 I just found behaves the same).
If you have space bound to magic-space I can understand that you would 
like the list to disappear, but at least that 2.6 didn't remove it,
too (although zsh might have behaved differently in 3.0.x).

So, can anyone test how 3.0.5 did this? Should we change it? Did the
behavior change? If yes, was the old way better?

Bye
 Sven
