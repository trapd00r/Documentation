Yeah.  '<->' is a bit cumbersome.  Too bad '#' means something else.

One thing that isnt clear to me.  Is this change just for scripts (everyone
keeps talking about scripts)?  Is it intended that '<>' still means numeric
glob in interactive mode?

You bet.  And for managing mh directories.  However all these are things I do
in interactive mode.  Having to use '<->' in a script is fine.
