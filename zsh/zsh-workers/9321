I can't get this to fail with the current code, even starting from a
distribution and using a separate build directory.  It looks to me like
Doc/Zsh/manmodmenu.yo isn't there.  Have you applied Tanaka Akira's patch
in 9311, in particular the fix for `make clean'?  You will then need to
make sure Doc/Zsh/modlist.yo, Doc/Zsh/modmenu.yo, Doc/Zsh/manmodmenu.yo are
recreated in the source tree (not the build tree, which doesn't have a Zsh
subdirectory).  After the patch, they won't be removed unless you do a
`make realclean' to rebuild the code which comes with the distribution.
Before the patch, they would have been, which probably caused the problem.
