Hmm... I'll see if I can rustle up some output to show it (machine is
down at the moment).  Cygwin 1.7.5-1 is the current runtime, but I've
seen these issues as early as 1.7.0 (which is why I hadn't released it
4.3.10 for Cygwin until very recently).

Yes, I've seen this too.  I remember seeing some discussion about why
this might be hanging but thought it might have some relationship to the
I/O redirection issues I've been seeing.  Just a guess, really.

I agree.  I'll see if I can get some debug time put in to it.  :-)

Ah, so, we cover it up in doc and claim it as a "feature"?  Good, good :-)
