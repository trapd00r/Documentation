I also noticed completing files from the index doesn't work as well as
completing files from a given tree... eg, If you type
git checkout HEAD gi<tab>
you get git.c, but if you
git checkout -- gi<tab>
you get nothing. However,
git checkout -- <tab>
lists all the files, and lets you cycle through them until you reach git.c
It uses __git_cached_files for that case, but some other places that call
that work just fine with something already typed. You got any idea?
