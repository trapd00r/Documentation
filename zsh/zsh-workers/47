This may be a bug.  I am not sure, I do not understand completion well
enough.


compctl -x 'C[-1,-*r*]' -g '*(/)' -g '*(-/)' -- rm

in my home directory:

woodlawn% rm -rf .<tab>
	completes to
woodlawn% rm -rf .p

This makes no sense to me...

compctl -x 'C[-1,-*d*]' -g '*.gz *.Z *.z' -g '*(-/)' -- gzip

here, I am in a directory with a directory and a tar.gz file

gzip -d <tab>
 will complete to
gzip -d <directory>

Am I misunderstanding this?  I want this to complete to .gz files.  

thanks
Soren Dayton
