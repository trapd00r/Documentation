   Greetings.  In searching the world for information about zsh  
completions for the PostgreSQL command line tools, I found a post from  
Dom in 2004:

http://www.zsh.org/mla/users/2004/msg01006.html

   And, it has lots of cool stuff in it.  Sadly, I appear to have  
forgotten enough about how to engineer the completion goo in zsh that  
I don't know how to *use* it.  I'm running zsh 4.2, or 4.3 (different  
on different machines), and postgres 8.2.

   Is there either a more up-to-date completion set for postgres  
command-line tools, and/or could someone give me a hand getting the  
content in that post to work for me?

   Thanks.

                 - Chris
