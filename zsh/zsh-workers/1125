It seems that signames.h get generated badly in beta18 on Linux (gawk
2.15,PL6).

The output is, among the rest:
[...]
        "death of child",
        "continued",
#ifdef USE_SUSPENDED
        "suspended (signal)",
\#else
        "stopped (signal)",
#endif
#ifdef USE_SUSPENDED
        "suspended",
\#else
        "stopped",
#endif
#ifdef USE_SUSPENDED
        "suspended (tty input)",
\#else
        "stopped (tty input)",
#endif

As you can see, the #else-s are prefixed by a backslash. I have no idea why
this happens. This fixed (manually by editing signames.h), it compiles.
However, the compctl bug remains.
