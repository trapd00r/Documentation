Actually I just realized that in other context completion correctly lists
unquoted matches (while inserting quoted versions of course):

bor@itsrm2% info ZSH Completion\ System
Completing menu item
Command Execution         -- 
Completion System         -- 
Completion Using compctl  --
...

But for file names it both lists and inserts quoted version:

bor@itsrm2% l a\ b/
Completing files
a\ b/      c\ d/      uudecode/

is it intentional? I too would like to see unquoted file names in list. Am I
wrong or it was this way at some point?
