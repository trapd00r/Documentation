I just tried this, and I get that message where I would expect to: it's
trying to load zle because it's got to inputline() and needs to load
zsh/zle to read the line since all the conditions for using zle are met:
the shell is interactive, shell input is from standard input, and zle
hasn't explicitly been turned off.

Could it just be the error message is new?  I haven't deliberately changed
that, but part of the aim of the zleentry() change was consistency, and
it's not obviously wrong to show a message the first time you try to load a
module and fail., else it may not be obvious why line editing doesn't work.
