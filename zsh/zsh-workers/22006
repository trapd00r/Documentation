Hello,

I'm living in a country where the Menu key does not exist in our AZETY 
keyboard.
That cause the zkbd script to be useless unless I remove the Menu key 
from the list of key bindings in that script.
Is this issue known, is there a workaround ?

Here is the patch to that file that remove the menu key:
--- zkbd~       2005-07-28 15:26:15.000000000 +0200
+++ zkbd        2005-11-17 10:01:43.000000000 +0100

        )

          Props Undo

It would be nice that Escape key (or another key as well) could be used 
to tell zkbd to ignore the key being requested.

Regards,
Philippe.
