Yes, your patch seems to fix my example problem. However, I have some
other files that still cause the same problem. They're called:

Meeting notes (2004-01-15).doc
Meeting notes (2004-01-30).doc

And when I have the first one on the command line, it is still
suggested as a completion when doing mv or cp.
