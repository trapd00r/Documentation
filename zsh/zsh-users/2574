You just install the completion system as described at the top of the
`zshcompsys' manual page and after that add this to your .zshrc:

  compconf completer=_complete:_match \
           match_original=yes

which gives the behaviour to first try it without inserting a `*' and
if that fails, it will try completion again with a `*' inserted at the 
cursor position.

This configuration key is desribed at the description for the `_match' 
completer in `zshcompsys'.

Bye
 Sven
