Subject: What's the "sep" parameter to multsub() for?
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

The "duh" answer is that it isn't for anything, because it's not actually
referenced anywhere.

It's passed non-NULL exactly when expanding ${(F)var=value}, which seems
like a rather strange special case.

What was intended to be going on here?
