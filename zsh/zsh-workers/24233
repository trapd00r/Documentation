The zshexpn(1) says:

  a[Mwhms][-|+]n
    files  accessed  exactly  n days ago.  Files accessed within the
    last n days are selected using a  negative  value  for  n  (-n).
    Files accessed more than n days ago are selected by a positive n
    value (+n).  Optional unit specifiers `M', `w', `h', `m' or  `s'
    (e.g.  `ah5') cause the check to be performed with months (of 30
    days), weeks, hours, minutes or seconds instead of days, respec-
    tively.   For instance, `echo *(ah-5)' would echo files accessed
    within the last five hours.

This isn't clear, and the only example is the one for which there
is no ambiguity. The man page should say that the fractional part
is discarded, and should give an example for a+1 for instance.

The find(1) man page from the findutils is more explicit:

  -atime n
    File was last accessed n*24 hours ago.  When  find  figures  out
    how  many  24-hour  periods  ago the file was last accessed, any
    fractional part is ignored, so to match -atime +1, a file has to
    have been accessed at least two days ago.
