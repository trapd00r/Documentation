I can't advocate deliberately causing a mirror site -- many of which *are*
inside the jurisdiction of the US courts -- to unwittingly make available
something that might make them subject to legal action.  Much as I'd like
to support DeCSS, this sounds more like a way to lose a lot of zsh mirror
sites than a way to promote DeCSS.
