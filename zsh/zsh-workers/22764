Subject: MB_ macros confusion

MB_ macros in zsh.h apply to multibyte characters while MB_ macros ztype.h 
apply to wide characters. I'd suggest calling them something different to 
avoid confusion (in particular I need something a l√° ctype for mb characters. 
I'm likely to roll up something but I almost picked up MB_ZISTYPE).
