I'm not quite certain what happened, so I'm referring this question here to
see if anyone might know the reason for this strange occurance.

I am using zsh 2.6beta13 on Solaris 2.4, on a Sparc IPC.
	
I handed zsh the following function:

list() { ps -aux | grep $1 | grep -v grep ; }

and when I attempted to run it, my drive started getting accessed like crazy
and I was unable to get the machine to respond to any keystrokes or mouse
clicks, even though I was able to move the pointer around (was in OpenWindows).
An attempt to login remotely from another machine met with no success, for
I never received a login prompt.

I am uncertain if this is a problem with zsh, Solaris 2.4, or the function
itself.  Someone else who looked at the function said it _should_ work, but
of course it didn't.  So I'm wondering if anyone here has a clue, and may be
able to explain the problem to me.

Thanks for any help.
