I must say that zsh is the shell I've been wanting for a long
while. I'd like to peruse what others are doing in their .zsh*
files to more quickly grasp what is possible with zsh.

Any who feel inclined, drop me copies of you .zsh* files and
also scripts that give examples of what you find most useful.
with zsh.

Thanks.
