I removed "space" as a word separator (I deleted all references
to "_my_extended_wordchars_space") since I only see spaces as
part of Mac and MS Win file names.

I also tried to simplify the bindings from:

> bindkey "^[^B"    _backward-to-/
> bindkey "^[^F"    _forward-to-/

to:

bindkey "[B"    _backward-to-/
bindkey "[F"    _forward-to-/

But this appears to disable the file name tab completion?
