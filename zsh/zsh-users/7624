Thanks.

I don't understand how this can happen. Otherwise this would mean that
bytes from stderr could be discarded, which would also be very bad.

Also, in the coprocess (while read line; ...), the colored data will
be output only after a \n. However, one generally wants stderr to be
output immediately (contrary to stdout), i.e. unbuffered instead of
line buffered. I assume that -k 1 would fix that, but it would be
inefficient. One could probably use "read -t -k 1" in a loop until
it fails or return a \n. Wouldn't it be fine to have a read option
(e.g. -T) that does this, i.e. read what is requested (i.e. until \n
or num characters if -k is used) or return as soon as nothing else
is available?
