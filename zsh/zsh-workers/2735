Yes, it's a shell bug.  In the above scenario, tstfn is getting
arguments "foo" and "".  The already-present suffix is being ignored at
that point, for completion purposes.  The function returns completions
"foo/foo" and "foo/bar".  If I recall the internals correctly, this is
being interpreted as requiring the addition of "/foo" or "/bar" to the
existing string "foo".  However, the additions are being applied to the
string actually there, "foo/", which the function saw no indication
of.

Theoretically, it's a simple matter of programming to make the -S
suffix be added in the right place.  Actually it's a bit of a
nightmare.
