as seen below, i can unset a command alias, but not a global alias. any 
ideas? thanks...

% alias foo=bar

% alias -g zsh-dir=/usr/ports/shells/zsh

% alias
foo=bar
rm='rm -i'
run-help=man
which-command=whence
zsh-dir=/usr/ports/shells/zsh

% unalias foo

% unalias zsh
unalias: no such hash table element: zsh

% unhash -a zsh
unhash: no such hash table element: zsh

% alias
rm='rm -i'
run-help=man
which-command=whence
zsh-dir=/usr/ports/shells/zsh
