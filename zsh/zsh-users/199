It might be nice to have another ZLE function to do this, but I don't
think it would be very usable.  More practically, make list-expand do
all expansions, including tilde expansion.  I often use list-expand
(which I have bound to ^G in both command and insert modes) to see
exactly what a glob pattern will expand to, and it would seem intuitive
for it to do tilde expansion too.
