    I think I've already told in this list that sometimes (quite
frequently, lately) I'm a dumbass. Well, in my defense I'll say that
I thought that zparseopts was a contribution script and I don't
wanted to ship my script with a dependency on another script. But it
is a builtin and I'm a dumbass...

    Thanks for pointing, Doug, otherwise I would have written a
parser for long options or used GNU getopt O:) Thanks a lot, really.
