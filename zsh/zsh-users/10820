Thank you for an explanation.

Right now I'm using the following matcher-list:

zstyle ':completion:*' matcher-list '' 'm:{a-z}={A-Z} m:{a-zA-Z}={A-Za-z}'

However, both disabling this matcher-list completely and entering the
one you specified seems to have no effect. Hostnames, as previously,
are delimited with dots as "delimiters" of some sort.
