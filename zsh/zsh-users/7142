Thanks!
setopt cdablevars is nice.

When I now hit ^xh I get the following:

tags in context :completion::complete:cd::
    local-directories named-directories      (_alternative _cd) 
    users named-directories directory-stack  (_tilde _alternative _cd) 
    users                                    (_users _tilde _alternative _cd)

Are the three lines three sets of tags?
Which line is active? The first one? Or are all entries active?

I still do not see, what _next_tags can do for me.


What is the meaning of the values in ()?

I see, that the user names are used for the name expansion. I do not
want that. How can I switch this off?

Stefan.
