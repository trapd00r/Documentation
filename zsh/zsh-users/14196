i've got a zsh script that i'd like to release under GPL. before i do 
that, i'd like to get a few people who can check it out, and try to break 
it.

the script talks to other computers on a well-known port, so it might be 
possible to provide the script with malicious input and cause Bad Things 
(tm) to happen.

contact me off-list if you'd like to have a peek at it, and try to find 
exploitable flaws.
