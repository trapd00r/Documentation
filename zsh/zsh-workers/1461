You might want to reverse this patch for the 3.0 release.  The same
error was made in a couple of other places too.

Less trivially, if you haven't done so already, I suggest you look
through my old -M patches.  Some of them contained small bug fixes in
addition to adding the option, and I think some of the bugs are still
around.
