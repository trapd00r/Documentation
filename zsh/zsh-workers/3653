Maybe there's even enough for a separate card, there are a lot of keys,
and even more functions, and when the new zle mechanisms become
standard a zle card will be pretty useful.  What's better, one huge
document or two smaller ones? It could be three with builtins, which would
probably be a good idea to include since there are plenty of commands like
read and print where I can never remember the options.  (I don't suppose
anyone apart from Sven and Zefram knows all the options for compctl.)

You're probably right, it's just standard 10pt.  I'm sure the Emacs version
is smaller (I didn't start from that because I was too lazy to fit everything
in columns myself and left it up to LaTeX).  I'll have a look at making
it 9pt (or 8pt, 7pt?) at some stage.
