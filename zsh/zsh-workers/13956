As I understand, these variables contain names for *all* possible
capabilities, not just for the ones defined by actual terminal. So far,
there is no advantage in using them (they are missing here, I presume they
are pretty much ncurses specific, curs_terminfo manpage already smells by
ncurses). curses is pretty well documented and standard so we could just
as well take any available documentation and list all capabilities.
