Sorry, that should say "just below the patched lines" -- it's another bit
almost exactly like the bit that inserts ${sort}.

I just saw PWS's patch, and it's probably better than mine -- but it also
may need to be applied to the similar ${tmp3} section.

PWS asked:

The matcher styles were the first ones I deleted when tracking down what
style caused the problem, and none of those made any difference at all.
