On the subject of disappearing zsh's....

With zsh 3.x and FreeBSD 2.2.5 or 3.0 when you alias su to su root -c zsh
(I prefer to keep roots shell as /bin/sh) then typing ^A^K followed by
two or three newlines will cause the shell to quit with an error like
"read error from terminal".

Anyone else come across this?

Regards,


Niall
