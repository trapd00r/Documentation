Every time I investigate a problem, another turns up.  Here's the list
so far.

1) 

% ./zsh -fc 'shift 2; print $*' first second third fourth               
second third fourth fourth


2) This is very puzzling.

% ./zsh -fc 'setopt extendedglob;  [[ PATH = [A-Z]# ]] || print Failed.'
Failed.


3) This is minor but probably wrong:

% ./zsh -fc '1this_is_ignored=foo; print $1'
foo

ksh prints:
ksh: 1this_is_ignored=foo:  not found
