Sven, you once asked about example, why adding new features to _arguments
is not as easy. Here you have one. For this reason I really think, that
something different (like flags in parameter expansions or globbing) is
needed. In this case you have just one syntax construct.

I do not suggest, that should not support current formats. It needs too
much rewrite. But for the future something different is definitely needed.
