How about extending ansi2knr to filter enums into a series of #defines?
Or maybe putting an enum test into configure and filtering zsh.h into
#defines if they aren't supported?  That would allow the code to remain
in an enum format (which makes for smaller patches if you keep the list
in alphabetical order) and still support the non-enum folks.
