Looks good, and that fixed another problem I had been about to report.

I have one remaining minor quibble:  Why is the default value of HISTFILE
set to ~/.histfile?  If you search the archives, it's "traditionally"
been ~/.zhistory since about 1996, with the occasional reference to
~/.zsh_history (which appears to have come about after Bash began using
~/.bash_history).  Not a big deal, but I've never seen ".histfile" before.
