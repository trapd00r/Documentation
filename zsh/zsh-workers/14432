Do you have TMPPREFIX set to something invalid?  The chunk of code in
question is this.  The questions are whether we need to make gettempname()
more robust about this, and why to goodness the system has decided to set
errno to EFAULT instead of ENOENT, which would make the error message
rather more understandable.

	fil = gettempname();
	if (((tempfd = open(fil, O_WRONLY | O_CREAT | O_EXCL | O_NOCTTY, 0600))
	    == -1) ||
		((out = fdopen(tempfd, "w")) == NULL)) {
	    unqueue_signals();
	    zwarnnam("fc", "can't open temp file: %e", NULL, errno);
	}

Oh, yuk.  We really need some way of getting the effect of `setopt
localtraps; unfunction TRAPZERR' in all completion functions.  I suppose
that means adding it everywhere we already have `setopt localoptions'
or `emulate -L zsh' (the latter already sets localtraps).  If anybody sees
this as their mission in life...
