Again, ksh93:

$ ksh -c 'printf "%(%.s)T\n"'
1194276214.312372000
$ ksh -c 'printf "%(%.9s)T\n"'
1194276216.337172000
$ ksh -c 'printf "%(%.3s)T\n"'
1194276220.963
$ ksh -c 'printf "%(%s)T\n"'
1194276238
$ ksh -c 'printf "%(%N)T\n"'
001528000
$ ksh -c 'printf "%(%3N)T\n"'
576
$ ksh -c 'printf "%(%6N)T\n"'
825647

For %<x>N, the question is: "should they be zero-padded?"
