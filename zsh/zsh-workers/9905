Seems to compile and run fine with OSF1 (a.k.a. DU 4.0) and Solaris 2.6.

Only got some warnings:

  init.c: In function `parseargs':
  init.c:254: warning: subscript has type `char'
  init.c:257: warning: subscript has type `char'
  ...
  params.c: In function `lcsetfn':
  params.c:1601: warning: cast from pointer to integer of different size

Which is easily fixed.

Bye
 Sven
