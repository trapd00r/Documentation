Hi, I'm having some trouble with tab-completion. I've created an alias 
for svn (subversion) which runs a pythonscript executing svn. One of the 
reasons for this is that I use the script to colorize the output.

However this caused zsh to stop tab-completing svn commands, eg. I used 
to be able to type "svn res[tab]" and it completes to "svn resolved". Is 
there a way to enable the same tab-completions for my alias?
