Subject: Return value of _multi_parts
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

According to the documentation, _multi_parts is supposed to return 0 if
it successfully added any matches.  However, there appear to be several
cases where it returns 0 as long as it has called compadd, i.e. without
checking the exit status of compadd.

Am I missing something, or is this incorrect?
