I have the following folding titles in my ~/.zsh/.zshrc

+---  7 lines: 4.1. Parameters and Shell Functionality
+---  9 lines: 4.2. Changing Directories
+--- 11 lines: 4.3. Shell Completion
+---  9 lines: 4.4. Shell Expansion and Globbing
+--- 11 lines: 4.5. History and History Expansion
+---  7 lines: 4.6. Job Control
+---  6 lines: 4.7. Shell Prompt
+---  6 lines: 4.8. ZLE
+---  8 lines: 4.9. Input and Output

I guess a Compatibility heading would be useful as well (as you have),
but I don't have one as I don't use any of those options (I mean,
seriously, who wants sh or csh when you can have zsh?).
