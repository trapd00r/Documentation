I linked /bin/sh to /bin/zsh 3.0.1. However, when installing certain
specific debian packages in linux I get the following error:

Setting up gzip (1.2.4-11) ...
install-info: read gzip -d </usr/info/gzip.info.gz |: 13

The problem doesn't happen if sh is a link to bash. I can get more
details if necessary.

Carlos
