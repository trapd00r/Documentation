&gt;&gt; Is there any logical reason why zsh's default is the way it is? I.e.,
&gt;&gt; when it sees
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; ls -l *.txt *.jp
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; And there are no *.jp, it has to stop the entire command, rather than
&gt;&gt; let the command give you a message, like was always the case in the
&gt;&gt; Bourne shell, ksh, and bash (without the failglob option)?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;
&gt;I guess, because it (zsh) originates more from csh.
&gt;
&gt;Anyway, it is too late to change defaults now.
&gt;
&gt;Personally I like to take it as indication that I made a typo in 
&gt;command. I do not have any problems with extra quoting when needed :)
&gt;

Before posting the question, I had a look at the glob options as well as the NOMATCH option, but the description of NOMATCH option was confusing.

This is the information from the zshoptions man page:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOMATCH (-3)



If a pattern for filename generation has no matches, print an error, instead 
of leaving it unchanged in the argument list.  This also applies to file 
expansion of an initial ~ or =.


Thanks for this info Andrey !!!
