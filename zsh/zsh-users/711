After some refinement, that line is now:

   'w[1,add][1,delete][1,modify][1,query] w[2,volume] s[-] , 
w[1,add][1,delete][1,modify][1,query] w[2,volume] s[-m_]' -k volparams -

which doesn't seem to work for the -m_ stuff.  I was just hoping that there
was an easier way of handling this, since this is just the first one for the
array.

Yes, I have, and I still stand by my statement.  This program was originally
written by some VMS people who converted it to UNIX, thus it's quite verbose
in its options.

Thanks for the help.  Any ideas why the -m_ doesn't work?  Maybe because the
previous s[-] is a prefix of [-m_] ?  Workarounds?
