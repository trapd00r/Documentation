Quoting Bruce Stephens (b.stephens@isode.com):

I think Vincent.Lefevre meant this:

When using command name expansion (correct term?)
can the zsh check the permissions on the executable files
and present those that are actually executable for the user?

Example:  Let's assume that the current dir (ie '.') is in the $PATH [*].
Then the zsh should behave like this:

	$ touch foo
	$ chmod 700 foo
	$ f<TAB>
	"foo" is shown
	$ chmod 600 foo
	$ f<TAB>
	"foo" is NOT shown

Is this possible?  (I hope that's not in the manual. ;-)

[*] Yes, I know this is a bad thing.  it's just an example, ok?  ;-)

Sven
