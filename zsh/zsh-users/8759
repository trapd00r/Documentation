The problem may be related to the fact that the shell executes traps
from within the signal handler.  Other shells presumably wait for the
handler to exit and execute the trap at the next obvious point (e.g. a
command executed).

However, I've tried this in some recent versions of zsh (4.2.0 and
4.3.0-dev-1, which is a moving target) and it seems to do what I think
you want... abort the programme when you hit ^C twice quickly, otherwise
continue.  So I'm not sure what you're doing wrong.
