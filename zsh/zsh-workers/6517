Now, that I finally got a debugger for  my system (DBX), I decided to
compile Zsh with debugging. To fully utilize DBX it is very advisable to
link -lg into executable. Unfortunately, doing so disables LFS :-(

It may be my private problem ... but I would *really* appreciate the way to
force LFS even if some of CFLAGS/CPPFLAGS/LIBS are set.

The joke is, I do not need LIBS to compile LFS program (getconf LFS_LIBS is
empty). May be, for items, that are empty (LFS_CFLAGS, LFS_LDFLAGS etc) we
should not disable LFS?
