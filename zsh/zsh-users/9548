    I cannot reproduce under Linux, as you confirm in your next
paragraph. Have you took a look at any initial environment that
FreeBSD may be setting up, outside zsh RC's? I'm not familiar with
FreeBSD and I don't know how its "init" sets up initial environment,
that may be the problem. It is quite weird...
