Subject: Preventing sorting in completers

Let me go straight to the point: I want to use:

zstyle ":completion:*:processes" command \
  'ps -u $UID -o ''pid tty s args'' --forest'

The problem is that the completion frameworks show the process list
sorted by PID. How can I prevent that and get the process list in the
order it was returned by ps (so that --forest makes sense).

Phil.
