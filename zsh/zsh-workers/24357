Yep that worked. Does the =~ operator support backreferences? I didn't
find anything searching through the manual for the word. This is what
I ended up with instead which works too:

#!/bin/zsh
setopt extendedglob
if [[ $# = 1 ]]; then
	if [[ $1 = *[^/]##:(#b)([0-9]##)(#B): ]]; then
		2=+${1[$mbegin[1],$mend[1]]}
		1=${1[1,$mbegin[1]-2]}
	fi
fi
if [[ -z $DISPLAY ]] ; then vim $@; else; gvim $@; fi

in case anyone ever wanted something like that.
