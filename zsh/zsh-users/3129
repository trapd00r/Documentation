Subject: 3.1.9, bug in apt-get completion?

Since 3.1.7 (which was packaged for debian woody a short time ago),
the package for apt-get install hasn't completed properly:

# exec zsh -f    
# autoload -U compinit
# compinit
# apt-get install a<TAB>
_alternative:-1: parse error near `||'
_alternative:70: command not found: _

Any ideas where the problem might be?  It could be a fault in the
packaging, or it could be I need to redump the completions?
