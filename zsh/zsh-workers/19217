As it happens, I don't have a precmd function defined. Peter's patch
didn't help: it seems the problem for my setup is down to zle widgets. In
particular, I have one defined for the enter key as a wrapper around
accept-line. $status seems unaffected so it looks like we need to be
saving pipestats somewhere else too.
