I'd say "no, it's a bug" ;-)

Looking at the manpages, I found this:

          up-line-or-search
          Move  up a line in the buffer, or if already at the
          top line, search backward in the history for a line
          beginning with the first word in the buffer.

It works like this:
~> zsh -f
% echo $ZSH_VERSION
3.1.2
% bindkey '\e[A' up-line-or-search 
% ls -l
total 1503
[snip]
% pwd
/home/jean-luc
% l_
   ^
   Cursor here, hit cursor-up -> beeps, because the _word_ l wasn't
   found in the history
% ls_
    ^
    Cursor here, hit cursor-up -> expands to ls -l

This behaviour seems to be OK, looking at the documentation...

Perhaps this can't be done in zsh-3.1.2 as it is now, we may need
something like "up-line-or-history-beginning-search-backward". ;-)

CU,
Thomas [using history-beginning-search-backward]
