} Is there a way in zsh-3.0.5 (or zsh-3.1.x) to use one command to declare
} a variable to be both local and an array?

No, there isn't.  This is even documented, poorly (a bit better in pws-4,
because it was part of my rewrite of the `typeset' documentation).

Why do you need to do this?  The variable will assume array-ness upon the
first array assignment to it.
