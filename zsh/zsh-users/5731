You will need to restart the shell after setting TERMINFO, since the
shell only examines it when starting up --- thereafter, it recognises
changes to the terminal type, but not to the location of the terminal
database.  Test that this works by starting a subshell after setting the
variable.  If it does work, you could set it in the Windows `environment
variables' dialogue which on XP at least is in the `Advanced' tab of the
system properties.  (I haven't actually tried this.)
