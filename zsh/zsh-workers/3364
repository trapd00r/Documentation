It's strange, because the (void) actually makes it wrong, implying it
takes no argument which is incorrect.  I would certainly suggest
either () or if there are compilers that like function pointers
to have arguments in their prototypes then the full
(int, char *, int, char *, int, char*)
which, even if it is sometimes the odd pointer out (though I would have
thought the NIS standard was fixed?), is nearer the mark than (void).
