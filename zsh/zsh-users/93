  I have a question about zsh's alias.
When I use 'which' command to my aliased command,
It behaves like this.

	% alias ls=ls-F
	% which ls
	  ls: aliased to ls -F

But if I want to know what 'ls' I'm using, in tcsh,
I type 'which \ls' and this worked just what I want to know. 

  (tcsh)% which \ls
	  /bin/ls

But in zsh, it doesn't work like this. 

	% which \ls
	  ls: aliased to ls -F

What shoud I do??? I'm using zsh-2.6-beta8.
