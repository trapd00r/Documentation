I'm inclined to agree.  Unfortunately, I've looked at the source and
it's not that easy:  the code for <> just checks for a number and adds
the file name to the list, while sorting of names happens altogether
at the end.  I'll try and think of a way of doing it.  I doubt if it's
worth rewriting the code to order the files as we go along just to
achieve this.

As you mentioned, the manual doesn't talk about NUMERIC_GLOB_SORT in
the globbing section, which is a mistake.  Here's an addition.
