Assuming they don't change the output format, this will find all
relevant lines by virtue of the beginning TAB, discard them, then replace
the second tabs with colons in case you want to use those descriptions
(and why waste free descriptions?).

All blocks of whitespace in that line should be literal TABs, by the
way.
