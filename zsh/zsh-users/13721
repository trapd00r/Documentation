Hi Andrés,

You should remove '.' and '/' from the WORDCHARS variable. Putting a 
character in WORDCHARS tells Zsh to treat it as if it is part of a normal 
"word". (i.e. that it *isn't* something that marks a word boundary.)

I haven't used emacs in a long time, so I'm not sure what else might be 
inconsistent between the two. And maybe someone else can chime in with the 
default value of WORDCHARS?

Best,
Ben
