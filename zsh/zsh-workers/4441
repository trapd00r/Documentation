Hi there.. 

I'm trying to compile ZSH on an HP-UX 11.00 machine with stock everything,
and I'm getting the following warnings with each .c files that the machine
tries to compile:

        cc -c -I.  -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -O  -o watch.o watch.c
cpp: "/usr/include/sys/stdsyms.h", line 15: warning 2001: Redefinition of
macro _INCLUDE_POSIX_SOURCE.
cpp: "/usr/include/sys/stdsyms.h", line 19: warning 2001: Redefinition of
macro _INCLUDE_XOPEN_SOURCE.
cpp: "/usr/include/sys/stdsyms.h", line 22: warning 2001: Redefinition of
macro _INCLUDE_HPUX_SOURCE.



Then the whole works dies miserably with the following death message:

cc: "watch.c", line 130: error 1588: "ut_xtime" undefined.
cc: "watch.c", line 130: error 1531: Invalid member of struct or union.

Has anyone run into this before?.. I tried a search of the list archives,
and have not found any references to HP-UX 11, which is why I'm resorting
to posting to the list.. 

Any help would be much appreciated!

Thanks,
Richard W.
