} So, this adds the -a option to zcompile which is needed to make
} functions that are currently only marked for autoloading to be written 
} into the zwc file. If it is not given and there is at least one name
} of such a function given, zcompile will return an error (and not write 
} the zwc file).

This is still a bit odd, because it means you have to check yourself
whether a function is defined or undefined before you know what result
"zcompile -a -c ..." is going to produce.  I'd rather that you simply
CAN'T compile both defined and undefined functions in the same pass.

Anybody else want to weigh in on this?
