Because there is no proper backtracking, the glob code sees that `a' alone
matches `ab#' and then it tries to match the rest of the string, `b' with
the rest of the glob pattern (which is nothing).

Yes, for zsh.  But the question was to use the zsh glob within perl, which
already have the regexp engine.  I'd thing that even for zsh the regexp
engine would be superior, but it is quite big, and zsh is big enough even
without regexps.  Of course a loadable regexp module can be added to zsh.
