This is far too specific to be hard-wired into _path_files, but maybe
there's some way of specifying transformations.  I still don't understand
how that helps you since I don't see when you want cygdrive to be the first
component.  It seems to me you should be using a named directory or
something, e.g.

c=/cygdrive
: ~c
echo ~c/d/...

You can hardly get fewer characters than that.
