I just never liked prefix-needed false behaviour. Maybe only because I
was used to always requiring a prefix going back to all my old tcsh
completions. One character prefixes are not a lot to type and it is
nice to cut down the number of matches.

I know what you mean here.

Personally, I think completeness purely for its own sake is pointless
unless you enjoy implementing it. Can I suggest then that if anyone
feels that completeness here is important or that there is some other
behaviour they want (such as choosing + or -) that they say. Otherwise
we should just remove prefix-needed from _popd so that what is
effectively a bug is gone. 

If anyone does make any significant changes to _popd, can I suggest
that they consider looking at _tilde which could and possibly should
call _popd (especially if _popd is renamed _directory_stack). Currently
it repeats much of _popd.
