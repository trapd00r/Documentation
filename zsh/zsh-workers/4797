I presume there's no harm in exporting everything so another module
can see it, so that ought to be possible.  Zefram hadn't decided on
how best to organise the AIX-specific stuff, so I haven't tried to do
anything clever, just maintain Zoli's work so it still compiles.
There's probably too much special-casing for AIX in configure, too.

I don't know how lete2ctl got left out.  I suppose I downloaded 3.1.5
and didn't upgrade it, but I thought I had.
