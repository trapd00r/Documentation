Maybe we need to grab another prompt escape.  Or maybe we could make a
stack of environments and line numbers and you can choose whether you want
the line number (e.g.) in the innermost eval, in the function above that,
or in the script the function is embedded in, fixing the other problem,
too --- if we can work out a way of deciding which the right one to print
at any given time is.  Maybe this needs more work to make quite sure
scriptname and lineno are tied together.  Maybe we can add an option to get
errors to print a backtrace of that.  Maybe I'm rambling.

I've committed the patch for now.
