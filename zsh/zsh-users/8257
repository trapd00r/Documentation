Here's what I'm currently using:

    http://www.comfychair.org/~duvall/sh.vim

You'll need to make mods to filetype.vim and scripts.vim to get this to
work (it make zsh a peer of bash and ksh), but you can do those to an
individual user's copy of those files.  I can provide those too, if you
like.
