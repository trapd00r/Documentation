Subject: I/O redirection problem in "zsh"

	Hello,

the I/O redirection in the following command doesn't work properly in "zsh":

grep localhost /etc/hosts fasel 2>&1 >/dev/null | cat -b

tron@colwyn:~>grep localhost /etc/hosts fasel 2>&1 >/dev/null | cat -b
     1  grep: fasel: No such file or directory
     2  /etc/hosts:::1                                  localhost
     3  /etc/hosts:127.0.0.1                            localhost
tron@colwyn:~>sh
$ grep localhost /etc/hosts fasel 2>&1 >/dev/null | cat -b
     1  grep: fasel: No such file or directory
$ bash
bash-2.05$ grep localhost /etc/hosts fasel 2>&1 >/dev/null | cat -b
     1  grep: fasel: No such file or directory
bash-2.05$ ksh
$ grep localhost /etc/hosts fasel 2>&1 >/dev/null | cat -b
     1  grep: fasel: No such file or directory

I can reproduce this problem with ZSH 3.0.8 under Solaris and ZSH 4.0.6
under NetBSD.

	Kind regards
