You may want to have a look at:

$ info 'info standalone' 'Custom Key Bindings'

(note that I used zsh completion to come with that command line,
so it's not completely off-topic ;).

pinfo doesn't support "i" and "g" which in my opinion are the
two features (with completion) that give info its special power.
