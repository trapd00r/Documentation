 "case-insensitive completion" (Mar  1,  1:16am)

} Hi, I use the following for case-insensitive completion:

} directories.  With 4.3.0-dev-5 it got even worse.

I suspect that if you compile with --disable-multibyte you'll at get
at least back to the speed before 4.3.0-dev-5.  I'd be curious to know
if you don't.

} Any plans to implement case-insensitive matching natively?

What do you mean "natively"?  The matcher-list matching is all done
in C, even though it's enabled via zstyle.
