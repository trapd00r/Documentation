I'd like to assign some operations like, e.g.,  vi-beginning-of-line 
to the special keys PageUp, PageDown, Home etc.
But I don't seem to understand the correct behaviour of the
bindkey command. Whereas I got with 'bindkey -s a b' the expected
behaviour, I don't know how to apply this to these special keys.
In xterm, they are called 'Prior', 'Next', etc. but how do I use
this with bindkey ?

Thanks for help,	Oliver.
