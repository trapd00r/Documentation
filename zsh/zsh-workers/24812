Hi,

Say that savehistfile is called with err = 0 and that unlink(tmpfile)
fails (hist.c, line 2204). Then it seems that tmpfile will never be
free'd because all the "free(tmpfile);" are in conditions that will
always be false.

Wouldn't it be simpler to replace all the "free(tmpfile);" by

  if (tmpfile) {
    free(tmpfile);
  }

at the end?
