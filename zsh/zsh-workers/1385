Do you really need the title updated every 5 seconds?  I use:

        precmd() { TMOUT=600 ; title }
	TRAPALRM() { TMOUT=60 ; title }

where "title" is a function pretty much like your "set-titlebar".  This
updates the title bar between commands if I'm using the shell regularly,
otherwise it waits for 10 minutes of inactivity and then begins updating
the title bar once per minute.  The 10 minutes is enough for me to scroll
back or spend a while editing a command line without having things start
jumping around on me, and since TMOUT doesn't have any effect during the
execution of commands (only while waiting at the prompt), using precmd
actually gets the title updated more regularly than using a short TMOUT.
