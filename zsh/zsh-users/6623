Yes ;)

You want the k modifier, in parens within a braced reference to your
associative array: ${(k)assoc_array}

typeset -A frodo
frodo=(foo bar frodo bilbo)

for key in ${(k)frodo};
do
	echo $frodo[$key]
done
bar
bilbo

I've been poking through the man pages, and I can't find how to get a list
of keys from an associative array.  Idealy, I'd like something like:

foreach key in array ; do
   if [ array[key] = someval ] ; then
      do stuff
   fi
done

Am I just being blind in the manpages?

Thanks;
Jason
