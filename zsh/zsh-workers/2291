I would really appreciate if you can send me more details.  From that I
cannot tell anything.  Note that zsh is not fully compatible with bash but
it tries to be compatible with POSIX.  Please send this install-info script
and tell me as much as possuble about it knowing that I've never used
debian of dpkg.

Thanks,

Zoltan
