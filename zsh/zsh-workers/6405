Subject: why bother with 'cd .' ?


This seemed to confuse my /bin/sh:


cd . && \
  CONFIG_FILES= CONFIG_HEADERS=./config.h ./config.status
/bin/sh: .: bad directory


(now I can't tell you why it confused /bin/sh, sometimes it seems to work  
and other times it gives that error)


could we have something like

if [ "$PWD" != "$SRC_DIR" ]

	cd $SRC_DIR
fi

(using whatever the proper variables are)

It just seems like an unnecessary step which for some reason can cause confusion
