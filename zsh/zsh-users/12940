That's an easy first thing to try...

One issue related to the multibyte changes is that zsh now pays much
more attention to the locale.  As you say the accented characters used
to work in the past, I presume that means they are in a single-byte font
(something like ISO-8859-1 or ISO-8859-15 being the most likely).  Is
your locale set up appropriately?  If "print $LANG" shows you something
including UTF-8 (or similar) the answer may well be "no", at least for
the encoding you are using.
