Clint Adams <clint@zsh.org> output:
:> Specifically, it worked in 4.0.9 and prior versions, but chokes on 4.1.1
:> and later.
:Is this because of 18492?  Did the 4.0 series changelogs get lost?

Reminder: 4.0 was a stable series and patches were applied to the branch
tag  zsh-4_0-patches
Thus you would want to check the ChangeLog in the main directory with
that tag.
