Yes. Completely remove this. If current dir no more exists, the error message
here is more of a feature - it indicates, that somethig went wrong. User always
has ``cd'' or even ``cd /'' fallback. I'm afraid, in this case zsh oversmarts
itself.  And after all, with all symlinks around, you cannot even be sure, that
$PWD is prefix of current dir :-( (Our /bin/sh resolves links while /bin/ksh
does not).
