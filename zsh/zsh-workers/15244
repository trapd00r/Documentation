} I've been a long time getting around to looking at this, but does this
} really work?
} 
}   zsh -c 'setopt printexitvalue; fn() { false;}; fn'

It works interactively:

schaefer<501> setopt printexitvalue; fn() { false;}; fn
zsh: correct 'fn' to 'fg' [nyae]? n
zsh: correct 'fn' to 'fg' [nyae]? n
zsh: exit 1

I don't know offhand why it doesn't work with `zsh -c', and I don't have
time to look at it just now ...
