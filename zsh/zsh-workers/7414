Subject: PATCH: Fix stupidity in makeinfo 3.12f
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

I don't know what "3.12f" is -- I have 3.12 here, 3.12f is at work -- but
"makeinfo zsh.texi" dies with

./zsh.texi:976: Use braces to give a command as an argument to @'.
./zsh.texi:983: Use braces to give a command as an argument to @'.
./zsh.texi:983: Use braces to give a command as an argument to @'.
(repeats for every use of @value{dsq})

Apparently @'<letter> is now the way to insert an accented <letter>.  Same
for @" and @` for different accents.

It appears that the workaround for zsh is as follows (patch against 3.1.6):

If anyone knows of a better way to accomplish this, please let us know.
