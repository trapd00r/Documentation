Perhaps. I'd probably have left it as _urls -f but you need separate
functions for nested tag loops to work so it seemed the easiest
solution. Trouble is that _webbrowser is for the most part just used
for a bunch of web browsers, renaming might break someone's own function
and I can't think of a better name (anyone?).
