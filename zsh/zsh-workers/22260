Yes.

That seems to have settled now.  Also, I found that libtool needs to
employ the same workarounds for its shell wrappers, too (we should
eventually add a test for this, I guess, to expose this).

In the shell wrapper, we need the effect of _AS_BOURNE_COMPATIBLE, but
not AS_SHELL_SANITIZE: the executed program should run in the user's
locale.  However, _AS_BOURNE_COMPATIBLE isn't published by Autoconf.
So I'm checking in the following patches to branch-1-5 and HEAD, and
I'll write to autoconf-patches to have a public version of the macro.
When we can rely on a released Autoconf version with the published
macro, we can simplify the shell wrapper head to something like this:
|   cat >>$output <<\_LTEOF
| AS_BOURNE_COMPATIBLE
| _LTEOF

Cheers,
Ralf
