hello, 

here are other things i miss in zsh. Maybe they actually exists and i
ignore them. So I ask: 

- a strict mode that failed to use undeclared (or unexported) variables
- a warning mode that produces an error message when undefined variable is
  used
- a mechanism to avoid command completions for some patterns: i would
  like every *private/* functions to be invisible for completion.

regards
marc
