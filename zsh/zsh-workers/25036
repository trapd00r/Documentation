Also, if you use "set -x", the subshell run within the pty will
have set -x as well, so:

> zpty -t scppty || echo "something went wrong" && exit
> zpty -r scppty line "*:" || echo "no password asked" && exit

will read the "+myscript:" in
"+myscript:1> scp hello...."

(by, the way, shouldn't it be something like "+(zpty):1> scp
hello"?)
