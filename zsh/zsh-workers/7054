It just occured to me, that it is quite useful in path completion. E.g. if you
have something like

/tools/{share,src}/z/bla-bla-bla

it is nice to hit a single key to accept ``share'' or ``src'' and immediately
continue completion after that. In this case a-a-i-n-h is probably misnomer ...
something like accept-and-continue-completion would  be better.
