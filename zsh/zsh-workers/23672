I think that the Debian bash extender was just as picky.

  command_not_found_handle
    The name of a shell function to be called if a command cannot be
    found. The return value of this function  should be  0,  if the
    command is available after execution of the function, otherwise 127
    (EX_NOTFOUND).  Enabled only in interactive, non POSIX mode shells.
    This is a Debian extension.

So I interpret that as meaning:
  unsplat_my_goofs() { blah; return 127; }
  command_not_found_handle=unsplat_my_goofs

However, I'm unable to get this to actually work on the Ubuntu-derived
distribution I'm using.
