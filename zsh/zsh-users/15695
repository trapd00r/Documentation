Uhm, too bad.  I am wondering whether case insensitivity in the
matcher could be achieved with a different trick?

Maybe somehow like this: Bart Schaefer once sent me a nifty function
to replace a leading 7 with a slash (common typing mistake on German
keyboards):

function _7slash {
   if [[ $words[CURRENT] = 7(#b)(*)(#e) ]]
   then
     compadd -U -X 'Correct leading 7 to /' -f /$match[1]
   fi
}

But no, I guess case insensitivity is a lot more complex, right?

Thanks,
 Andy.
