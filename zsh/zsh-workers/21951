This is potentially a good idea, but you will need to be careful since
those "int" definitions for the variables now marked as ZLE_CHAR_T have
been around a very long time and it's not necessarily clear if they will
hold an EOF or not, though if they do they should certainly now be
ZLE_INT_T.  The distinction is quite recent and not necessarily
consistently applied throughout.
