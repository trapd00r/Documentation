By the way, you might want to try the manual as well as Google.

BRACE EXPANSION

...

     Note that brace expansion is not part of filename generation
     (globbing);  an expression such as */{foo,bar} is split into
     two separate words */foo and */bar before  filename  genera-
     tion  takes  place.  In particular, note that this is liable
     to produce a `no match' error if either of the  two  expres-
     sions  does  not  match;  this  is  to  be  contrasted  with
     */(foo|bar), which is treated as a single pattern but other-
     wise has similar effects.
