Parse `texi2html -version' if we can identify the affected versions.
On the other hand, if they're bringing it back soon, it's probably
not worth the trouble.

Here's a unified diff of 3.1.9 with old texi2html versus today's CVS with
new (grepped for "Approximate Matching").  So I guess the answer is no.

-<H3><A NAME="SEC61" HREF="zsh_toc.html#TOC61">Approximate Matching</A></H3>
+<H3> 13.9.5 Approximate Matching </H3>
