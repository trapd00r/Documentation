You can't just do that!!  Think of the effect on the Y2K strategic compliance
assessment team's project timeline projection if you actually just fix things
rather than documenting a requirement to rewrite the system.  And consider
the world economy.  Already international consultancies are crashing into
receivership as the basis of their service is callously rendered redundant.

When we see the children starving in the streets we'll know why.
