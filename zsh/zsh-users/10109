Hi,

 on a Linux 2.6.16.1 system I have installed zsh 4.3.2.

 I got problems with the zsh history, which is neither read nor
 written.

 I read the thread previously appearing in this list and tried to
 understand and check, what was said.

 1.) Shell must be interactive:
     When given 
		  setopt
	 on the command line I got
          interactive
          monitor
          shinstdin
          zle

     therefore I think the shell is interactive.
     On the other hand, the manpage stated, that (beside other things)
     /etc/zshrc is read. That is not the case.

 2.) File could not be locked.
     How should I check this ?

 3.) $HOME/.zsh_history is corrupted.
     I emptied that file....no effect.

 4.) File permissions wrong.
     $HOME/.zsh_history is rw be myself only.

 5.) HISTSIZE is "0" or not set.
     echo $HISTSIZE gives me: 9999
 
 6.) SAVEHIST not set or "0":
     echo $SAVEHIST gives me: 9999



 I have no idea what I wrong with my settings.
 
 What must be set to get the history stored and read ?

 Thank you very much in advance for any helpful reply ! :)

 Keep zshing!
