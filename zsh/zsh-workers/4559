} The following (extremely cut down for testing) /etc/zshenv is used:
} #! /bin/zsh
} export OSDESC=`/usr/bin/uname -sr | awk '{ printf("%s_%.1s",$1,$2)}'`
} export GROUP=`id | cut -d\) -f2 cut -d\( -f2`
} 
} Now the problem is that on occasion (that is a more than one in four
} times) either (and sometimes both) of the environment variables do not
} get set. 
} 
} Is this a known bug?

It's a fairly recently discovered bug; see

	http://www.zsh.org/mla/users/1998/msg00661.html

but you'll probably want to grab http://www.zsh.org/mla/zsh-users/18xx.tgz
and extract file 1880 to get a clean copy of the patch.
