Bart Schaefer <schaefer@candle.brasslantern.com> typed:
:As we've seen, this is apparently already handled because the `=' appears
:in the list of mailbox names in ~/.muttrc, which zsh greps for.  Adding
:the `compset -P' might actually break things.

One note, it doesn't yet check ~/.mutt/muttrc if ~/.muttrc doesn't exist.
