} That's the correct way to do it.

Actually in most cases I'd personally rather that the patch be inline,
unless it's really large.  It makes it easier to search for in the
zsh.org mailing list archives, and nobody seems to agree on what MIME
type to use for attached patches.

(The correct type, by the way, is "text/plain", not some bizzaro thing
that tries to explain how it's in diff format.)
