Hmm.  I can also confirm that adding zsh-completion and setting up a new 
user w/ Stephan's example .zshrc does *not* trigger the issue for me.  
Using that user, I get the following:

zshtester@hp ~ % find $fpath -maxdepth 1 -name compinit 
/usr/share/zsh/4.3.10/functions/Completion/compinit

For that user (which, again, doesn't have the problem, but maybe this is 
useful as the "control" group), $fpath contains 
'/usr/share/zsh/site-functions' and a slew of directories under 
'/usr/share/zsh/4.3.10/functions'.

Best,
Ben
