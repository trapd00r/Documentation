Subject: on globbing dot files
Date: Wed, 07 May 2008 15:41:48 +0200

I would like to expand * to include files starting with a dot, but 
excluding . and ..

Doing a

  setopt glob_dots 

locally does not solve this problem, since this applies to *everything*.
Is there a suitable option available? Alternatively, can I achieve an
expansion
to all directory entries except . and .. by some other glob expression?
(I checked
the man page, including the section on extended globbing, but did not
come out
with a useful solution).
