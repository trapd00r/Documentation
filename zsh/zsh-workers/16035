Subject: Another completion oddity (needs fix on branch)
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Starting from:

    cvs commit -m'Fix typos.' ChaCompletion/Unix/Command/_mount
                                 ^
with the cursor right after the `a' in `Cha', I get the following upon
pressing tab:

In 4.0.1,

    cvs commit -m'Fix typos.' ChangeLogCompletion/Unix/Command/_mount
                                                                     ^
with the cursor all the way at the end of the word.

At the head of the -patches branch,

    cvs commit -m'Fix typos.' ChangeLogCompletion
                                       ^
with the cursor after the `g'.  This is obviously unpleasant, it should
not have chopped off the tail of the word.

And with 4.1.0-dev-2,

    cvs commit -m'Fix typos.' ChangeLogCompletion/Unix/Command/_mount
                                       ^
with the cursor after the `g'.

I actually wasn't expecting any of these to work; I had meant to type
space-ctrl+B-tab, fumbled it, noticed the 4.0.1 behavior, then compared
to the others.  However, there's clearly some kind of fix that needs
to go in on the branch, as the behavior there now is worse than it was
in 4.0.1.
