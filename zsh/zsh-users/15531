I think you do need to set up tags here, at least most scripts do and I
haven't tried without.  However, that should all be standard: looping
over the states is fine, then use the usual _wanted stuff inside the
case and the tags get sorted out automatically, in principle.  There's
nothing to stop you using _alternative, either.

In short, just adding the loop over the state to the sort of stuff that
usually appears in the "case" here should be OK.
