trap doesn't work as follows.

% Src/zsh --version
zsh 4.0.1-pre-2 (i386-unknown-freebsd4.2)
% Src/zsh -fc 'trap "echo INT" INT; sleep 60'
^C
%

It should print `INT' but it doesn't.

bash, pdksh, ash and ksh93 works as follows.

% bash -fc 'trap "echo INT" INT; sleep 60'     
^CINT
zsh: exit 130   bash -fc 'trap "echo INT" INT; sleep 60'
% 

ksh93 exits with 2 instead of 130, though.
