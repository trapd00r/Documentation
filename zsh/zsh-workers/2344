Actually both approaches are available for PATH.  The default is the
one I suggested.  Perhaps (z|)modload should honour PATH_DIRS.

Might I also suggest that .so be appended always (whether or not the
path i searched), and the filename tried without the suffix only if
that fails.  This provides the expected behaviour in all but the most
freaky cases.
