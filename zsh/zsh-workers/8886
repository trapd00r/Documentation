} 
} So I don't seem to have the original PATCH: Previous zsh.yo.in patch wasn't
} good enough, nor does it seem to be on the web mailing list archives.

Original was 8857, "PATCH: zsh.yo not properly generated from zsh.yo.in"

} Why can't zsh.yo be generated in the build directory?

When zsh.yo is in the separate build directory, the zsh.info generated
from zsh.texi is empty except for the comment that it was generated by
makeinfo.  I tried rebuilding from clean and got the same result; the
trace output from "yodl" indicated that it wasn't reading any of the
$(sdir)/Doc/Zsh/*.yo files.  When I relocated zsh.yo back to the source
tree, everything worked.

Maybe there's just some include-path thing going on that I missed.
