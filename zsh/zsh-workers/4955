I'm not quite sure what you mean here but it reminded me of one feature for
the completion which might exist but would be a useful addition if it
doesn't: the ability to apply completion rules to files directed into
commands. For example, 
I would want the command-line 'giftopnm < ' to only complete with .gif files.
Is it already possible to do this?
