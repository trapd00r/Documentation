I think the point is it works even if shwordsplit is set.

% setopt shwordsplit
% args() { echo $#; }
% bar=('one word' 'another word')
% args $bar
4                                    # i.e. 'one' 'word' 'another' 'word'
% args "$bar[@]"
2                                    # i.e. 'one word' 'another word'

It still doesn't quite make ksh users feel it home, it needs to be
"${bar[@]}" for that.  In fact, with ksharrays (or `emulate ksh')
turned on you need it in zsh too, so perhaps the NEWS file ought to
have that if it's trying to be all-inclusive.
