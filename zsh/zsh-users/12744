`zstyle -L "*"' does indeed list everything, at least if you have a
recent version of the shell (it looks like I added it in 4.3.3 because,
as you say, it's intuitive).  Before that arguments to `zstyle -L'
weren't useful, but `zstyle -L' with no argument would list everything.
If you want a more processed format, rather than the lines you need to
feed back to the shell to reproduce the state, then just run `zstyle'.
