Why is it that when I apply patches to zsh, and I try to rebuild, I get
this !$#@#^ error:

kodiak /usr/local/src/zsh-3.0-pre2# make
cd . && autoheader
/bin/sh: autoheader: not found
make: *** [stamp-h.in] Error 1

Man, this pisses me off to no end.  I end up having to download a totally
new tree and start from scratch.

What am I doing wrong?  I've tried make clean, make distclean.  Neither of
them work.
