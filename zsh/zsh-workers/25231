Subject: PATCH: approximation of absolute path in root directory

X-Virus-Status: Clean

Dispatches from Maintenance Nightmare Central:

/uzr/bin/em<TAB> -> //uzr/bin/em

even with approximation, which isn't quite what you want (and it happens
with just /uzr, too).  Luckily this one seems to be easy: don't update
the directory-so-far if it's still only /, otherwise this gets added as
an extra path element and becomes the offered completion before we even
get to approximation.

I found this when looking for the problem with approximation of files
beginning with a '.', but that one seems to arise from a lower circle of
Hell ("It Came From Compadd; Only The Compiler Could Stop It").
