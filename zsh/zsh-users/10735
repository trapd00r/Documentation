-c is to sort of the file change-status time. You want file
modification time, it's ls -rtl.

And it should be

ls -rtl | ...

Or

ls -rtld -- * | ...

ls -tl | tail +2

ls -trl | sed '$d'

Also:

ls -trld -- *(om[2,-1])

Also:

IFS=$'\n\n'
lines=( $(cmd) )
for line in "${(@)lines[1,-2]}"; do ...; done
