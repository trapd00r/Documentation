You've run "compinit" which loads the completion system.  A few parts of
that create new keybindings, all of which assume "bindkey -e" ... whereas
you're using vi-mode bindings.

If you move "compinit" to earlier in your startup files so that it is
done before "bindkey -v" you may have somewhat better luck.
