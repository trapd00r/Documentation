From: Peter Stephenson <pws@csr.com>

I've uploaded something for chapter 4 of the user guide, on zle, at

http://zsh.sunsite.dk/Guide/

with minor formatting changes to the rest.  Next I hope to finish
chapter 7 and assemble the appendix (which will be essentially the
Meta-FAQ) before improving the formatting a bit and eventually add
texinfo and indexing support.
