I'm talking nonsense:  no, it hasn't been rewritten and I must have been
looking at the wrong thing.  However, I still don't understand
how you're getting that problem.  Could you send a trace with "setopt
xtrace" both in there and in match-words-by-style (I presume it
depends on what word style is in effect since I can't se it)?

Thanks.
