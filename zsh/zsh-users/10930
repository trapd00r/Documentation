I can't think of anything you can do in the shell:  it's hard-wired to
the terminal so you would somehow have to persuade the output to come back
from it.  There's no use using a pseudoterminal since you can't change
the terminal of the shell that's actually running... unless there's some
fiendishly clever trick using the zsh/clone module of cloning the shell
into a new pseudoterminal.  I couldn't get this to work with zsh/zpty since
(I think) clone doesn't get passed the new terminal early enough.
