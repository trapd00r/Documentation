I don't really like this double testing and personally would vote to
put everything under the :zle top-level context.  I'd like to know how
many users are out there who have styles for any of the (currently
only three) zle functions.  Maybe we should ask on zsh-users?

But first we should probably try to come up with a context format like
the one we have for the completion system, with a fixed number of
parts (some of which may be blank most of the time), which allows us
to extend it to future uses.  And that's hard to predict, I fear.
Maybe we will eventually have a way to get the context-information-
gathering-part of the completion system from normal zle widgets.

I had collected some ideas for that (and the suffix stuff etc.) but on
saturday my hard disk was killed.  Sigh.


Bye
  Sven
