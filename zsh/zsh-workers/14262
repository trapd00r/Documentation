Definitely the former, so the patch doesn't help.  Here's the config.log
section in full.  Looks like some standards organisation has been along and
redefined anything... it doesn't work any more, but no doubt it passes some
quality control test instead.

widec.h is including wchar.h, which is including iso/wchar_iso.h, so this
seems to be intrinsic to SunOS 5.8 (again).  Maybe we should upgrade to
5.7.  Is there some other way of doing the test that will simply see if it
compiled?  I should know but I can't remember.
