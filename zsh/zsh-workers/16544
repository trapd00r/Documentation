couple datapoints:

ash does not complain; args starting with a bracket match the 1st case.

pdksh-5.2.14 run as sh does not complain, but only the literal argument
  [* matches.

The ash manpage, at least, explicitly allows this case:

     A left bracket ([) introduces a character class.  The end of the
     character class is indicated by a ``]''; if the ``]'' is missing
     then the ``['' matches a ``['' rather than introducing a character
     class.

I don't have a link to the new Single Unix spec at the moment; what's
it say?
