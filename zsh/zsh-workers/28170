The difference seems to be whether the zsh/compctl module is loaded.  I
don't immediately know why zsh/compctl would be necessary for proper
execution of menu-select, but if I add

zmodload zsh/compctl

to the minimal zshrc, I am no longer able to force a crash.  I tried with
zsh 4.3.9 as well, and I can crash it if compctl is not loaded, but not
when compctl is loaded.
