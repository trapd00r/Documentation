Well, it is in the info-pages, section on modifiers. Excerpt:
`h'
     Remove a trailing pathname component, leaving the head.

`r'
     Remove a trailing suffix of the form ``.'XXX', leaving the
     basename.

`e'
     Remove all but the suffix.

`t'
     Remove all leading pathname components, leaving the tail.
[...]

So:

swen@kreta <~>: foo=/usr/local/bin/mumble
swen@kreta <~>: echo ${foo:t}
mumble
swen@kreta <~>: 

Hope this helps.
