The xterm disappears in spite of the sleep?

That could be it.  Try this:

    xterm -e zsh -c "tty ; sleep 10000" &

This should give you an xterm showing the name of its tty device.  Assume
for purposes of this example that it's /dev/ttyp2.  Now run this:

    zsh -l < /dev/ttyp2 >& /dev/ttyp2

That may break a few things (such as "less") because /dev/tty might still
be the terminal from which you run "zsh -l", but everything else should be
OK.  Now you can try to get zsh to exit, and the error message ought to
show up in one terminal or the other.

"sleep 10000" is about 2 hours 45 minutes; you might need a bigger number.
