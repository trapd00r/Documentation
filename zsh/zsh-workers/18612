Subject: weird zsh-4.0.6 error
X-Mailer: VM 7.14 under Emacs 21.0.106.1

When I run /usr/local/bin/zsh-4.0.6, it complains:

	/usr/common/zsh406:1: permission denied: 

What does this mean?

/usr/common/zsh406/ is the directory where the global zsh system
files are located. If I rename /usr/common/zsh406/ to something else,
the error goes away.

It doesn't matter if I rename zshrc, zlogin, zlogout, etc. in
/usr/common/zsh406/. to hide them, the error still occurs.
