I also noticed this as I now have to use AIX 3.2.5 at work (but it will be
upgraded to 4.1.? till June).  I made some ugly dirty hacks to circumvent
the problem.  I do not have the patch here at home, but I'll post it
tomorrow.

I thought that fchdir was a standard function, mandated by POSIX.1.
Anyway, an OS which calls itself Unix and does not have fchdir is really
broken in my opinion.  Fortunately AIX 4.x already has this.
