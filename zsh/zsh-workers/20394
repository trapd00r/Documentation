The code changed from "right" to "wrong".  It used to look like this.

    pm = (Param) paramtab->getnode(paramtab, "SHLVL");
    if (!(pm->flags & PM_EXPORTED))
        pm->flags |= PM_EXPORTED;
    sprintf(buf, "%d", (int)++shlvl);
    pm->env = addenv("SHLVL", buf, pm->flags);

I rationalised addenv and in my zeal I probably didn't notice that the
shlvl code wanted rationalising in a slightly different way from the
others.  The PM_EXPORTED flag is now handled within addenv().  So it
looks like the patch is correct.
