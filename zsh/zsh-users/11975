I wondered why the diffence betwen the {1..9} and {a-z} syntax, and read
the BRACE EXPANSION section in zshexpn(1). It says


     An expression of the form ‘{n1..n2}’, where n1 and n2 are integers, is
       expanded to every number between n1 and n2 inclusive.  If either 
num‐
       ber  begins with a zero, all the resulting numbers will be padded
with
       leading zeroes to that minimum width.  If the numbers are in 
decreas‐
       ing order the resulting sequence will also be in decreasing order.

       If  a  brace  expression  matches  none of the above forms, it is
left
       unchanged, unless the BRACE_CCL option is set.  In that  case, 
it  is
       expanded  to  a  sorted  list of the individual characters
between the
       braces, in the manner of a search set.  ‘−’ is treated specially
as in
       a  search  set,  but ‘^’ or ‘!’ as the first character is treated
nor‐
       mally.


I wonder: What is a "search set"? I couldn't find it anywhere in zshall(1).
