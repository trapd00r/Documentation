No, this is what it does:

## ------------------------------- ##
## 1. Simulate --prefix-builtins.  ##
## ------------------------------- ##

# m4_define
# m4_defn
# m4_undefine
define([m4_define],   defn([define]))
define([m4_defn],     defn([defn]))
define([m4_undefine], defn([undefine]))

m4_undefine([define])
m4_undefine([defn])
m4_undefine([undefine])

> Why out of interest? What would autoconf 2.5 have it replaced by then?

configure.ac is the new canonical name.  Something about "configure.in"
being too vague, I think.
