aha --- most systems have an external command newgrp available which
seems to be missing there.  zsh does have some mechanism for changing
the group by altering $GID, but the way it's set up it's only usable by
the superuser, as far as I can tell.

This seems to be a fatal flaw --- anybody else any suggestions?

(P.S.: note new spelling of Deutsches and Elektronen.  Sorry.)
