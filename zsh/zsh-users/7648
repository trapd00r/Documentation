Hello list!

I want to implement an "inline cd-keybinding", that means:

	[Some previous output]
	~/bin/foo/bar $ 

After typing (for example) ^U twice:

	[Some previous output]
	~/bin $ 

For that I need a command or widget, that deletes the prompt on the next
line and moves the cursor back to the line preceeded.
However, I haven't found anything like that. Is there another possibility?

Thanks!
Fips
