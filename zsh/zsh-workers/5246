Hi,

compiling zsh 3.1.5 on Linux Alpha with egcs seems to trigger a
compiler bug which makes it crash on some tab completions. It's there
in egcs 1.0.3a and 1.1.1 with -O1 or greater, but not with -O0. It's
gone in a recent snapshot. I suggest a note about this to be added to
the appropriate section.

	Falk
