Nope.  I read the excerpts you provided, in the belief that
you meant them to clearly support your statements.  Shoot me
for not catching that "[v]ariable assignments specified with
special built-in utilities" meant "variable assignments
preceding the command name."

Yup, sure, that's pretty definitive.  What does it mean for

	X=one unset X

Nothing, I suppose.  unset will unset.  Never in a million years
would I have expected after

	X=one :

for X to persist, while after

	X=one true

X is unset.

I wonder what the original purpose was, here.  A "get out of jail
free card" that let code implementing the special built-ins slide?
These things (err, the SBIs) all look commands that *must* be 
implemented
as built-ins, so perhaps in some implementation(s) there weren't the 
hooks
to unset vars after they completed.  POSIX just codified it so 
pre-existing
implementations could remain compliant?
