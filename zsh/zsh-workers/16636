I strongly suspect that this is legal poking around, and nothing is
actually going to change because it wouldn't do Sourceforge any good;
lawyers love adding phrases like `we reserve the right to slay all
users' wherever they think they can get away with it.  I would want to
see some evidence of more than rewording, however apparently
unfavourable, before deciding it's necessary to move.

If enough people want to move strongly enough, we're in a pretty good
position to be able to do so, however.
