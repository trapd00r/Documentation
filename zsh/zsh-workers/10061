Hi all,

I've just registered a new account at sourceforge.net and had a peek
around.  It all looks very tasty, and seems to me to be the ideal
place to relocate the CVS repository.  Since I'm totally out of sync
with patches at the moment, but have a bit of free time for once, I'd
like to help get this going quickly.  Are there any objections to this
move, and if not, would I be helping or just getting in the way by
registering zsh as a project on sourceforge?

Adam
