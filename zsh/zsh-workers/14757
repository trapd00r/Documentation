Yes, zillions of them.  Look for `config.cache considered harmful' in
the archives.

Andrej> It depends. For initial configure run you have to manually use

Or -C.

Andrej> or set cache file in site config file

s/status/cache/.

I fear I understand what you mean, but I might be wrong.  The use of a
cache is a decision that belongs to the user and no one else.  You
should not try to change this.

We will write something about it in 2.51's docs, thanks.
