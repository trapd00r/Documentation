My prompt:

%


I'm running on OS X, which includes zsh as one of its three default 
shells (the others are bash and tcsh).  I keep the prompt simple and 
put the information in the title bar of the terminal window where it is 
dynamically updated.  I use a terminal program called iTerm which has 
tabs.  I also update the labels of the tabs dynamically.  I've made a 
number of customizations that might be of use to other OS X zsh users.  
These can be found on my zsh slobbering proselytization page and links 
therein:  http://tinyurl.com/3373b
