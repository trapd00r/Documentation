I do not know that command sequence so I tried several times :)

[hanno: /home/hanno]>splay
zsh: command not found: splay
[hanno: /home/hanno]>r-screen
zsh: command not found: r-screen
[hanno: /home/hanno]>/usr/ssplay
zsh: command not found: splay
[hanno: /home/hanno]>

That is what comes out when I try to type in the command !
The first letters until "splay" are not shown on the display, the =20
rest ist shown....
What am I doing wrong ?

[hanno: /home/hanno]>echo $ZSH_VERSION
4.3.2

I should also mention that the german letters "=E4" "=FC" and "=F6" are =20=

also not supported.
Thanks again for your help, I really appreciate that !

Best regards
