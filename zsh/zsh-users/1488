Fine with me. I did make the offer as other people uttered, that it
could be an advantage to collect all the zsh stuff at one
place. Anyway - let's take one thing by the time, but my offer still
stands, if the need should pop up. 

I will like to make clear, that my offer was not an attempt to "steal"
the whole project, and it was not a critic at all the nice people who
host part of the zsh project - I just want to support it as much as
possible and offer the resources that I have by hand.

Best,
Karsten.
