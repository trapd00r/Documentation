- Diagnostics
  More errors are now caught (circular AC_REQUIRE dependencies,
  AC_DEFINE in the action part of an AC_CACHE_CHECK, too many pops
  etc.).  In addition, their location and call stack are given.


But, seriously, new version looks really much better an cleaner than before
(it does not completely solve AC_CHECK_HEADERS problem, but leaves it up to
configure writer to decide if warnings are harmful).

I intended to go through configure.in when new version comes out. Not for the
4.0.1, of course. The problem is, this will make configure.in incompatible
with previous autoconf versions. Any thoughts?
