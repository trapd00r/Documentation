This is a slackware Linux installation with a 2.0.23 kernel.

configure reports:

 checking host system type... Invalid configuration `i686-unknown-linux': machine `i686-unknown' not recognized

I tried changing occurrences of i[345]86 to i[3456]86 in config.guess and
in config.sub, but that didn't help.  I was able to force it with

	configure --host=i586-unknown-linux
	
Perhaps a more general solution could be found so that this doesn't break
every time Intel revs the Pentium?
