Actually I meant loops in the C-code that are exited only under
certain conditions but not because some trap handler calls break,
return or continue.

Hm, I think I vaguely remember the problem you described (unless you
never posted it to the list, in which case I vaguely remember
something completely different). Dunno if it has anything to do with
the bugs I'm trying to fight... (but I don't think so, I would need to 
know where it hangs).


Bye
