Between 4.0.x and 4.1.1, the requirements to quote a "/" in the
replacement part of a ${name//pattern/repl} expression changed from two
backslashes to one.  The new syntax doesn't work in the old versions and
vice versa.

When did this change, and why?  Is the best way to work around this to
put the replacement string in a variable?

Thanks,
Danek
