You can stick a backslash before the =; that works in bash, too, since
you can quote any character, even if it's not special.

The problem is that it's using path expansion `=prog', but I couldn't
tell you why it should at that point; in fact, I suspect it shouldn't.
Hence `setopt noequals' or `setopt nonomatch' would remove the problem,
if you can live with the side effects.
