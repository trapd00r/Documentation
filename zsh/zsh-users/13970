It's a zsh configure-time option, --enable-function-subdirs, which the
FreeBSD port sets; that went in at:
  http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/ports/shells/zsh/Makefile.diff?r1=1.58;r2=1.59
ie, some years ago; the zsh-devel port was up until 4.1.1, so also went
some time ago.

What I tend to do is make $fpath unique and then just shove stuff into
it, so that I preserve the existing built-in default and don't need to
worry that repeated calls will extend $fpath.  So:

  typeset -U fpath
  fpath=(/earlier/stuff $fpath /later/stuff)

or for you, it could just be:

  typeset -U fpath
  fpath+=(~/.zfunc)

If you want to stick with specifying it manually, then:

  fpath=(
    /usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions
    /usr/local/share/zsh/$ZSH_VERSION/functions{,**/*(N/)}
    ~/.zfunc
    )
