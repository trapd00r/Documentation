It appears that bash gives the infix '=' higher precedence than the prefix
'-d' or the infix '-a':

bash2-2.03$ mkdir '='
bash2-2.03$ if [ "-d" = ]; then echo There is a directory; fi
There is a directory
bash2-2.03$ if [ -d = -x ]; then echo There is a directory; fi
bash2-2.03$ if [ -d = -a x ]; then echo There is a directory; fi
[: too many arguments
bash2-2.03$ if [ -d . -a x ]; then echo There is a directory; fi
There is a directory

I haven't checked whether e.g. POSIX says anything about this.
