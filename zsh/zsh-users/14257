} I don't see how I can make a 'cd' function which will refer to the
} 'cd' builtin.  Not a big deal, I could call the function 'ccd'.

cd() { builtin cd "$*" }

} I can't do something simple like cd "$@"

"$@" is the same as "$1" "$2" "$3" ...

"$*" is the same as "$1 $2 $3 ..."

(note placement of quotes)

You should probably find a book on basic shell programming and learn
the elements of shell language behavior before you try to dive in
with the zsh manual.  It's not written as a tutorial, and the zsh
tutorials that exist assume knowledge of the basics.
