It's high time I released another version of the shell, it's been ages.
I've uploaded a test version to

ftp://ftp.zsh.org/pub/development/zsh-4.3.10-dev-2.tar.gz
ftp://ftp.zsh.org/pub/development/zsh-4.3.10-dev-2-doc.tar.gz

Please let zsh-workers@zsh.org know of any problems installing this,
particularly on less-used targets.
