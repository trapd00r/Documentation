Lower case beta? Who said anything about beta? I used a German
double s as an example. A German double s is not the same as beta.

These routines produce different results depending on the language
you have selected. If you use these routines to do filename matching
then you will match different filenames depending on the selected
language. This is what I think is confusing.

Should ﬂ be handled just like a space, that is, not changed at all?

You post from a .de domain so you should know about double s.
The upper case version of ﬂ is SS.

1. If we have a filename with the name "Strasse" and one with the
   name "Straﬂe". Both filenames are created when the English
   language is selected. If the German language is selected later,
   wich one of them should be accessed as "STRASSE"?

2. If we have a filename with the name "Straﬂe" you can access it
   as "STRASSE" if you select German, but not if you select English.

Once more, how is the filename "Straﬂe" handled on the Amiga? Don't
tell me they cheated and made the upper case version "STRAﬂE"!

Case insensitive filenames in an international environment is
quite a big can of worms. Should it be opened?
