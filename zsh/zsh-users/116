Currently zsh's handling of `sched' and the shell function `periodic'
(if defined) are very simple.  Zsh just checks time stamps in the
function preprompt() and executes scheduled commands or `periodic'
if it has been long enough.  To do anything better would require setting
up signals, etc...   I can add it to the TODO list, but I doubt it
will make it in the next production release.  There are currently just too
many other things to work on.
