It's called "toall".

What is "print"? There doesn't seem to be an executable of that name on 
my (OS X 10.3) box, and printf doesn't have a "-l" option. I tried 
something similar with echo, and saw no difference.

toall sleep echo "this is one line"

produces

this is one line 19980

whether or not $@ is in quotes. (I was invoking the script from sh, 
which I think on this box is actually bash running in sh-mode.)
