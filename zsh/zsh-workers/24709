If you remove the "2>/dev/null" you get the error message:

zkbd:5: read-only variable: ARGC

The trick here is that, at the top level of the shell, declaring ARGC to
be local is a no-op.  Inside a function, however, declaring it local is
creating a new parameter, which should lose its read-only-ness.  Somehow
ARGC has lost the PM_HIDE attribute.

Changing "local -i ARGC" to "local -ih ARGC" to explicitly hide the
special-ness of ARGC will make zkbd work again, but I am puzzled as to
why it suddenly became necessary to include "-h".  The call signature
of load_module() changed a bit and consequently so did module.c, but
I can't see how that would have changed the way the builtin special
parameters are created; the IPDEF1 macro and its usage for ARGC have
not changed in quite some time.

So although I say "lost PM_HIDE", in point of fact I don't know how it
had PM_HIDE in the first place.
