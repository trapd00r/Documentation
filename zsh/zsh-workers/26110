} Yes, with 4.3.9-dev-1-cvs1127

I just notice the word "ibook" in the prompt.  This is happening on a Mac?
Does the case of the path in the variable match the case of the path on
the filesystem?  It may be that case insentitive globbing is not working
with the path expanded from the variable.

Beyond that suggestion I'm at the end of my immediate usefulness.  Get
some output from _complete_debug (ctrl-x question-mark).
