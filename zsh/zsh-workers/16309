Yes, this could be useful. The form in which I'd like to see it in is a
more general version of the fake-files and fake-parameters styles and
available in all contexts as opposed to just in _arguments.

In the case of this specific issue, should we maybe factor the
filesystem completion out of _mount into a new _filesystems that can
also be used here?

We should be careful how we document this. It should be a way of
tweaking available completions to fake extra matches and should not be
a substitute for writing functions.

Yes it would be useful but perhaps a little messy to implement. I
thought about doing printf completion for printf as opposed to find
which is less useful. I suspect that this might be a good place to use
_regex_arguments but I've yet to look in any detail.
