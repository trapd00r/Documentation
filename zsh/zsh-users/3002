Hi,


I=B4ve been using zsh with HP-UX for the past two months and I am very i=
mpressed =20
with it. I've succesfully configured my connection through a vt100 termi=
nal to =20
work just the way I wanted.

However, I've run into some problems when trying to configure zsh for us=
e with =20
an HP Terminal. In essence, I do not seem to be able to map the arrow ke=
ys to =20
anything. I have read as much documentation on zsh as I could find, yet =
if the =20
answer was there, it eluded me. =20

I even tried the following without success:

    bindkey "$(echotc kl)" backward-char
    bindkey "$(echotc kr)" forward-char
    bindkey "$(echotc ku)" up-line-or-history
    bindkey "$(echotc kd)" down-line-or-history

After a while, I decided to write a mini C program to see what kind of v=
alues =20
the HP Term sent when pressing the arrowkeys .. :

#include <stdio.h>
int main(void) {
   int c,a;

   for(a=3D0;a<5;a++) {
     c=3Dgetchar();
     printf("c=3D%d - %c\n",c,c);
   }
}

=2E. and to my amazement, the program could not pick the arrow keys as b=
eing =20
pressed! This leads me to believe that either the device for the HP term=
 is =20
"swallowing" the arrow keys, or that the system just uses a different sy=
stem to =20
comunicate the arrow keys. (maybe the Term sends the current cursor posi=
tion in =20
binary or something).

The reason I say the latter is because if I do an export TERM=3Dtty whil=
e my =20
terminal is in HP mode, I still cannot detect any arrow key presses with=
 the =20
above little hack.

Nontheless, other programs such as HP's own "SAM" (System Administrator =
Tool) =20
and others have no problem detecting the arrow keys and using them to se=
lect =20
items, etc.

I really welcome any ideas and suggestions, since I've pretty much run i=
nto a =20
wall here. =20


Kind Regards,


Alec Rodriguez
