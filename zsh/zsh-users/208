So what's the big deal? There's nothing magic about a shell--it's just 
another program.  It's not like running zsh will automatically give you SU 
priviledges or something.
FWIW, my "real" shell is ksh.  But at the end of my .profile, I have:
"exec ${HOME}/local/bin/zsh -l"

We have folks here who in essence use emacs as their shell, and others who 
essentially use netscape as their shell.
