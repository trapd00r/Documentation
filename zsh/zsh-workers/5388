Subject: Just a comment...


>From Peter's `__rcs' example file:

  if [[ $NMATCHES -eq 0 && ...

I always used (the equivalent of):

   `local nm=$NMATCHES ... [[ $NMATCHES -eq nm ]] ...'

because I think that we should make the files as re-usable as
possible. The above will fail if the function for another command
first generates some matches and then calls __rcs to get those
matches, too. Dunno if this makes always sense, though.

Bye
 Sven
