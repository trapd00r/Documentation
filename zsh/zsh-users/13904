X-Virus-Status: Clean

if i start a job in the background such as:
 	sleep 30 &
  i get a status report sent to stderr as expected:
 	[1] 1234
  but when the job exits, i get this to my terminal:
 	[1]  + done       sleep 30

i would expect both of those messages to be sent to stderr. why is the 
second message sent to my terminal? how can i direct it to stderr?

tested with zsh 4.3.6.

thanks...
