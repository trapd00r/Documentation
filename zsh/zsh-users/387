Yes, that was another (more minor) problem.  It would 'make' but  
not 'make install' for me.

However, it would compile just fine.

Apparently I've got something on my system that's tricking it into  
running slowly when drawing prompts and/or going back through  
history commands.  Others report no problems on 3.3.  After the  
'make' you just have to move zsh to /usr/local/bin by hand
