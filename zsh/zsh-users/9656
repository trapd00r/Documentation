Hi,

I have defined a suffix alias for pdfs:

alias -s pdf='acroread'

Now I call a pdf:

test.pdf &

As far as I understand this is expanded to:

acroread test.pdf &

Now acroread gets called and shows the pdf. Now I logout of my zsh, but in
this case also acroread gets closed. When I was using bash as my shell, I
was able to call something as a background job from bash and close bash
without closing the job. What am I doing wrong with zsh here?


Sebastian
