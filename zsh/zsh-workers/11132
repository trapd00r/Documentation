This would probably be fine, although I'm not sure we're able to rename the
repository as such.  We can create a new tree under /cvsroot/zsh rooted on
zsh-4.0, and possibly alias it under the name `zsh' (not sure about this if
there's a directory zsh, but it probably ought to work), by tricks in
CVSROOT/modules, and alias the existing zsh tree to `zsh-3.1', but renaming
the current zsh tree to zsh-3.1 might not be possible.
