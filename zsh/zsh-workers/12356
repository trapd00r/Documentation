Subject: PATCH: _mh where path is not the default
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

I have my mh mail in a directory called mhmail because the default
(Mail) still contains all my real mail archives whch I still access with
mush. The problem with this was that the mh completions were then
completing mail folders from the wrong directory.

The patch modifies _mh to run mhpath + to get the correct directory. Is
anyone concerned about the affect this will have on speed? I'm happy to
back-out the patch if anyone objects. Another possibility would be to
cache the directory by storing it in a non-local variable.

Are the completions written for nmh or mh? I'm using nmh so are there
any problems I should expect? Also, has anyone written a zpty wrapper
around the whatnow command to do completion in a similar way to the
nslookup thing. I'd also appreciate any other cunning zsh scripts for mh
anyone has.

Thanks

Oliver
