I am a faithful linuxer and Zsh user.  I presently
run RedHat 4.1 with the standard Zsh rpm package v. 3.01-2.
I have run into what I would consider a very serious
problem.  When I type the following:

user@host path> for foo in * 

My Zsh gets lost, does not give me PS2 prompt and returns
me to the PS1 prompt....

PS1 prompt= user@host path>


Have you ever seen this before and do you have an answer??

TIA,

PS.  My return path does not work because my ISP 
won't give my home machine an alias.  You MUST
reply by "hand" to dirac@eznet.net.   Sorry....
