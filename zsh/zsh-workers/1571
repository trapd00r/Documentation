Surely you cannot reproduce it?  Well, then it might be a bug of
the _old_ SysV4...  In any way, it would be necessary to confirm
it more objectively.  Please do the following:

	% truss zsh
	[wait till the z-shell prompt appears]
	[then type <v> <SPC> <^D> to list the completions]

If you see something like

	write(10, " caml-light/ "... 48)	= 48

then the output is buffered.  Or if you see something like

	write(10, " c", 1)			= 1

then it is not buffered.
