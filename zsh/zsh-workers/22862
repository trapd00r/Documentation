I do not think it should be done unconditionally. I guess it has been 
discussed back when we started all this completion candy; and common opinion 
was that running arbitrary program with --help may have unwanted side 
effects.

Also, making it explicit allows passing different sorts of --help; 
specifically I am thinking about KDE/Qt --help-qt, --help-kde, --help-all, 
etc.

And finally it opens up a can of worms that is called l10n. Now-a-days you 
almost sure gets localized help output; so be prepared for questions "why 
this one appears in Russian and this one not" :)
