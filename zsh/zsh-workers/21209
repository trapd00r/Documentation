That would be OK.

I'm going to end up with an essay like
[:FIELDSEPARATOREXCEPTTHEYSOMETIMESGETABITPRUNED:]
if I do that.  Not just the variable name but also the documentation
consistently uses the word "separator".  Introducing "terminator" now is
going to confuse the issue.  Hasta la vista.

[:FIELDSEP:] and [:WHITESEP:], perhaps?
