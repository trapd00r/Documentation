Thanks ;), it works nicely. I should have think at first that i didn't
have that key combination in my keymap... instead of trying to make zsh
to map an unknow key sequence :-/

I understood you wrong O:), i thought that what you explained me about 
bindkey -s was to invocate zle directly. But i've find out diggin in
then manuals that zle widgets only can be called from inside a shell
function...

Right now i just want to run two widgets, but i feel confident
enough to do a widget if in a near future i have some 'dark' ideas XDDDDDD
