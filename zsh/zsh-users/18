It's not actually OS-specific - the patch to gnu's ls uses ANSI escape 
sequences to set the colors - you just need an xterm that's been patched to 
support color (which you can get from ftp.x.org - i'm currently using one 
that's had the scroll bar put on the right hand side, too).

That said, I can't say i'm hanging out for zsh to support this when listing 
completable files, even though I love my color ls :)

Enjoy,
 Andrew
