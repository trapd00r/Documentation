Yes, but makes the browsing (reaching the section you're
interested in) difficult.

Yes, we agree that's the problem, you need some external tool to
index your pages, as HTML has not such thing built in.

The index and search are built in "info". I'd agree the "info"
client command is not the best that one could have come up to,
but at least the "info" format makes it very easy and direct to
reach the information you're looking for.

And zsh has completion support (to some extent) for info.
