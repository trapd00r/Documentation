Peter, thanks for the reply.
The file builtin.epro looks fine:

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
/* Generated automatically */
#ifndef have_Src_builtin_globals
#define have_Src_builtin_globals

I tried to google 'unterminated argument list invoking macro "_" ' and =20=

many forums suggest it due to compiler outdated. So I checked gcc --=20
version and it was 4.0.1. I also happened to have 4.2.1 so I reset the =20=

symlinks and made it active. Then performed "make distclean"; =20
configure; make, and got similar but not the same error:

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

All this while I had already initiated svn co svn://gcc.gnu.org/svn/=20
gcc/tags/gcc_4_5_1_release gcc-4.5.1 to get the latest gcc. It just =20
finished, but man that's a whole 1.1GB for gcc??? I am seriously =20
deterred to compile that beast to get zsh updated while everything =20
else seems to be fine! If this error is fixable by any other means I =20
would like to try that first.

Thanks
