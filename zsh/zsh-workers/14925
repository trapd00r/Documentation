Er, ahem, yes, ah, well ...

That does almost solve the specific cvs example, but it means writing
your own set of tests for what the context is.  That is, I want the
restriction to apply to the subcommand name, and it'd be OK if it also
applied to any options either of cvs or of the subcommand, but I don't
want to restrict the completers used for the actual file arguments.

There, zstyle -e can be used to even better effect.  The "hard part" has
been done by computing the context; the rest of the conditions can then
be included in the value of the style.
