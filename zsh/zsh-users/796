I was thinking about the history stuff in zsh last night, and it struck me
that it would be neat to have a per-directory history mechanism. That is,
for some (or all) of the directories that I ever work in, it would be nice
to be able to segregate the command history based on the directory. Even
better would be able to group sets of directories and have a separate
history records for groups of directories.

Is this easily done at the user level given zsh's current set of features?
What do folks think about incorporating something along these lines in a
future release?
