Well this is probably a hidden FAQ, but I'll be damned if I didn't
spend too much time figuring out where this bug was/wasn't.  :)

% echo -n testing
% 

Hrm, that doesn't look right.  I'd expect the terminal to look like:
% echo -n testing
testing% 

What gives?  Is there a reason or switch that fixes this?

zsh --version
zsh 4.1.0-dev-5 (i386-portbld-freebsd5.0)
