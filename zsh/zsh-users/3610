Actually, even on standard Unix filesystem root can create hard links to
directories (that depends on definition of "standard" of course. It was
possible on original Unix filesystem, I believe, it is possible on UFS but
impossible on Veritas). But I needed it for stable, well defined, environment
and link count is quite enough.
