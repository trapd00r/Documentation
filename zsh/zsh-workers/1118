Yes, it was Peter. You can always get it back from the archive:

  X-Mailing-List: <zsh-workers@math.gatech.edu> archive/latest/1061

But it *is* apparently already in b18:

  $ patch < ~/tmp/keep1d/b18p2
  ...
  Patching file Src/exec.c using Plan A...
  Reversed (or previously applied) patch detected!  Assume -R? [y] n
  Apply anyway? [n]        

though the bug persists:

  $ echo $ZSH_VERSION
  2.6-beta18
  $ print =(cat ~/.zshrc) =(cat ~/.zshenv)
  /tmp/zsha000MD /tmp/zshb000MD
