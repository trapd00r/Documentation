Geoff explained most of it, but didn't point out that in fact the export
command doesn't create arrays at all, because there's no special syntax
for it:  it just treats "foo=(a b c)" as a string.  (At least, I don't
think he pointed that out.  I've just got back am reading through my
mail rather rapidly.  I've got about 100 different ways of becoming a
millionaire in a month.  This is worse than Reader's Digest.)
