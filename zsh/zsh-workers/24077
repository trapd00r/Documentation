Subject: some more problems with delete-whole-word-match, no patch
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Content-Disposition: inline

1)
if you have two or more spaces between two words and position the
cursor between them, invoking the widget will insert an extra space.
2)
if you position the cursor at the end of the word, the widget leaves
the last character of the word intact, if there is a trailing space
(as there usually is if the word isn't the last word on the command
line).

Putting in a [[ $pos1 = $pos2 ]] && return seems to fix the first
problem but I figured the problems are probably related somehow, and
I'm not sure why the second occurs.
