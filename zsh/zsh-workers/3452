does anyone have any ideas on how make completion case-insensitive ? 
based on a setopt, for example.
tcsh allows you to set complete=enhance, but I don't see anything
similar in zsh.

I know NT users would appreciate it,  and I am sure a lot of unix users
would like 
the feature too.

If anyone can think of a patch, or point me to the relevant code that
needs
modification,  i'd be grateful.

thanks,
