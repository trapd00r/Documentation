Hm. It is caused by the argument '-F^(' for cvs diff.

It is very useful for lisp programs, because the @@ ... @@ line has a
function/macro definition line and it makes easy to find the function
name of the hunk.

Anyway, it is no problem for applying the patch. Don't mind.
I deleted it from ~/.cvsrc just now.
# Recently, I don't develop lisp programs.
