I can find at least half a dozen places where some form of user input is
sprintf'd or strcpy'd into a PATH_MAX-sized stack buffer or static buffer.
The most obvious one is in sourcehome() in init.c, where $ZDOTDIR plus a
slash and file name is sprintf'd into such a buffer.

In all cases I found, the string being placed in the buffer really is a
path name, so PATH_MAX is a reasonable limit upon it; so I don't suggest
switching to dynamic buffers, but shouldn't there be a bounds check?
