Subject: _arguments -s and mutually exclusive options

Hello all,

It appears that options specified as being mutually exclusive are not
honoured as such by _arguments if -s is used.

For example,

_arguments -s \
  '( -b )-a[option a]' \
  '( -a )-b[option b]' \
  '-c[option c]'

will, incorrectly, offer option 'b' as an available completion here

% blah -a<TAB>

but correctly, will not offer option 'b' here

% blah -a -<TAB>

Is this a bug or have I missed something relevant in the docs?

Thanks,
Doug
