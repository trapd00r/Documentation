Mutt's Maildir support is minimal.  Not a good example.

I should've been more explicit and said Maildir++, which most software
aside from Dan Bernstein's uses, for various reasons.  It's a superset.

Example documentation:
 <http://www.courier-mta.org/maildirmake.html>

Something a quick google throws up:
 <http://www.exim.org/pipermail/exim-users/Week-of-Mon-20000103/015916.html>
which in passing demonstrates this being used.

*sigh*  Thank you.  I did check the run-time docs.  And I just
double-checked:
~/zsh-4.0.2/Doc%; fgrep -i maildir **/*.yo
Zsh/compctl.yo:example(compctl -/ -W ~/Mail maildirs)

Further, the entry for $mailpath in zshparam(1) is a little misleading,
as it makes explicit reference to what happens when an entry is a
directory:
             If an element is a directory instead  of  a
     file the shell will recursively check every file in
     every subdirectory of the element.

I'll just go rebuild zsh ...  (serves me right for using *BSD Ports)

Thanks,
