Subject: Trial patch for showing completion in progress

I often want to find out what completion is doing when it goes away for
a while.  Here's a simple patch that helps, though I think there's more
that can be done.  No documentation yet.

As defined, you set the show-completer style to true in any context
where you want to show the status.  It is examined when each element of
the completer list is tried.  The message is overwritten by any list
output.

Is there a better place for this?  On the whole I think this point is OK.

Is there a way of doing this only if completion takes a certain time?
E.g. store SECONDS as floating point and examine it at certain key
points?

Is there a way of removing the zle -M output if the completion produced
no output?
