Here's my latest helpfiles.  It also does something about unnecessary
indentation (if it's not embedded in a manual page, it's pointless to
start half way across the page).

It didn't know when the end of zshbuiltins was.  A test for ZSHCOMPCTL
was needed.

I altered the suggested run-help to handle compctl by invoking
zshcompctl.  There's not much point duplicating the manual page in
this case.

# helpfiles:  make help files for Z-shell builtins from the manual entries.
# Author:  Peter Stephenson <pws@ifh.de>

# Create help files for zsh commands in the current directory;
# assumes no other files are present.
# No overwriting check;  `.' becomes `dot', `:' becomes `colon'.

# Any command claiming to be `same as <foo>' or `equivalent to <foo>'
# has its help file appended to the end of <foo>'s and replaced by a
# link to <foo>.  (Arguably the help file should be put at the start
# instead.)

# Takes one filename argument, or stdin: the zsh manual page as a plain
# ascii file: `man zshbuiltins | colcrt -' (remember the -) should do
# the trick.

# If you don't have colcrt, try 'col -bx'.  The x is necessary so that
# spaces don't turn into tabs, which messes up the calculations of
# indentation on machines which randomly wrap lines round to the
# previous line (so you see what we're up against).

# Example usage:
#    cd ~/zsh-3.0.0				# or wherever
#    mkdir Help
#    cd Help
#    man zsh | colcrt - | helpfiles
#    run-help() {
#      typeset zhelp=~/zsh-3.0.0/Help		# or wherever
#      [[ $1 = . ]] && 1=dot
#      [[ $1 = : ]] && 1=colon
#      if [[ $1 = compctl ]]; then
#         man zshcompctl
#      elif [[ -f $zhelp/$1 ]]; then
#    	  ${=PAGER:-more} $zhelp/$1
#      else
#    	  man $1
#      fi
#    }
# now <Esc>-h works for shell builtins.
