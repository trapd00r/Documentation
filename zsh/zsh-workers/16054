That was my original thought, but I've been batting around the idea of
having it controlled by a prompt escape.

It'd be a bit odd to have an escape that means something only in the right
prompt, I guess.  I was even thinking maybe of overloading %E, e.g. in the
right prompt, %-1E causes it to be deleted after the fact, or something
like that.  Probably that's just too strange.

`setopt TRANSIENT_RPROMPT', perhaps?
