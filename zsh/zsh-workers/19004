It seems that automatic responses as from vacation and majordomo
are managing to confirm subscriptions and qconfirm by automatically
replying. I think that has been the cause of the odd few pieces of junk
that have made their way through since qconfirm was added. All part of
viruses now forging their from addresses I suppose. qconfirm and the
mail server are going to need to spot the difference between automatic
and manual replies. I'm not sure if that's easy to do or not.
