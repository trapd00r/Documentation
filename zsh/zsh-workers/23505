In the case of Perl, the fix is simple:

  alias -s pl='perl -S'

(although the Perl documentation is now so complicated it took me five
minutes to confirm that...)

More generally, you could write a shell function to do this.

pathfind() {
  local dir
  for dir in $path; do
    if [[ -f $dir/$2 ]]; then
      $1 $dir/$2 "${(@)argv[3,-1]}"
      return
    fi
  done
  print pathfind: file not found in path: $2
  return 255
}
alias -s pl='pathfind perl'
