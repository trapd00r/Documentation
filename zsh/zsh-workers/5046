That's why I was reluctant to change it without asking first.

The only place where tokstrings was used is in exalias() if that is
called with tokstring=NULL after spell-checking, which happens
whenever a redirection operator is parsed. The value from the table
will be used if someone calls yylex(), gets the token for a
redirection operator and uses tokstr before calling yylex()
again. After searching a bit I still can't find a place where this
happens.
