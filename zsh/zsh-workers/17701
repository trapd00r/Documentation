It may be in the generation of multilib.h, in that case, because
genmultilib in the gcc source directory looks pretty hair-raising.  I
ran it as

  sh ../../gcc/genmultilib \
  "msoft-float mcpu=v8" "soft v8" \
  "msoft-float=mno-fpu mcpu?v8=mv8" \
  "" ""  ""

with both sh and `ARGV0=sh zsh' here (SunOS 2.6 --- actually the real
compilation system is using a simpler set of options, but that should
just make a problem less likely), and they gave the same output, but
obviously this depends on the input --- if you can find out the
appropriate flags, which seem to be fairly well hidden, you could try
this.  Make is actually using

	  $(SHELL) $(srcdir)/genmultilib \
	    "$(MULTILIB_OPTIONS)" \
	    "$(MULTILIB_DIRNAMES)" \
	    "$(MULTILIB_MATCHES)" \
	    "$(MULTILIB_EXCEPTIONS)" \
	    "$(MULTILIB_EXTRA_OPTS)" \
	    "$(MULTILIB_EXCLUSIONS)" \
	    > tmp-mlib.h; \

You are using a recent version of zsh...?
