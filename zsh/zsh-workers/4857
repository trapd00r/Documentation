I understand that this is not directly related to ZSH, but I just tried to
print the latest texinfo from pws-4 and found usual problem ...

Is it posible to format  texinfo for double side printing? Currently,
margins are the same for both odd and even pages - that not only looks ugly,
but sometimes text is so near to bind side, that it is almost impossible to
read.

thank you
