Oops, forget my mail. The rename is done only when there's a tmp file,
which was the case I excluded. So, the code is OK (I've also re-read
it, and there don't seem to be other closes() calls that could remove
the lock). Perhaps it lacks a bit documentation, in case the code will
have to be modified in the future.
