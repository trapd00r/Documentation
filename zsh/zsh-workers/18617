It was me who updated it in May 2000 and to be honest, I'd completely
forgotten about it since. It's also linked from the news page for the
3.0.8 and 3.1.7 releases. The other files in the same directory are
also out of date but they may not be linked in at all. I'm not sure how
much value there is in having the detailed changelogs on the web. I'm
not too keen on updating them manually so if you want to write a script,
that'd be great and if not, they can be removed.
