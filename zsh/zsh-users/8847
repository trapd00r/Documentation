Hello,

I can't get which-command ("^[?") to work as I would like:

 ~ % echo $ZSH_VERSION
4.3.0-dev-1

 ~ % whence -c ls
ls: aliased to /bin/ls -h -N --color=auto -F -v

 ~ % which-command /bin/ls
zsh: command not found: which-command

 ~ % alias which-command='whence -c'

# If I just run the command I get

 ~ % which-command ls
ls: aliased to /bin/ls -h -N --color=auto -F -v

# but if I use "^[?" (is which-command) I get:

 ~ % which-command /bin/ls
/bin/ls

How can I get ^[? to behave the same as a command line "which-command"?
