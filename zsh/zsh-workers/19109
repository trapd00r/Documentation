    Hi Oliver :)

    Oh :((( So I'm stuck with the ${= notation, I suppose. Or maybe I
can use two variables, one scalar for programs that want PAGER in
their environment, like man, and other for use interactively, when
manually write '|$PAGER', which will be an array. I'll try to choose
sensible names...

    BTW, is this noted in the manual? I've missed it if so.

    I was thinking about it: how the heck does zsh to store a
specially formatted variable, like an array is, in the standard
environment so the programs which use it doesn't get confused?

    Obviously.

    No, I won't ;)) I don't thing that storing just the first element
is a good idea. If you declare an array is quite possible that you
want all items ;).

    Thanks a lot for the answer :)
