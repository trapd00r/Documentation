Only under the condition that HISTFILE is written to between the two commands.

What if someone figured that it'd be easier to

% rm -r ~/.local/var/zsh

than to

% rm ~/.local/var/zsh/history

(if, for example, ~/.local/var/zsh contains other transient data to be removed).

card, but it seems I'm the only one playing cards of that suite.
