I think the user guide is intended for linear reading; it's quite hard
for me to start somewhere in the middle. After all, that's what most
"user guides" are; you should turn to the (more formal) documentation
when you need reference. User guides are more like books,
documentations dictionaries.

Given its linear nature, I suppose that adding cross-references can be
distracting and unnecessary (that's what the documentation needs),
while highlighting the first appearance of terms is quite helpful.

I'm looking forward to a heavily loaded "git pull"!

(I'm not a native speaker so please correct my English if it sounds
weird or impolite. Thanks!)
