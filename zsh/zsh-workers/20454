Chinese and Korean I believe. If you want some examples, try looking at
some of the spam that gets sent to you. I've got some examples at the
moment if you want. We might have to be careful about putting any of
that in our test scripts if we don't want to offer our Chinese users
drugs, inkjets and larger members. :)

No. They'll do the right thing if other locale's are selected: mbrlen
will return 1 in a single byte locale.
