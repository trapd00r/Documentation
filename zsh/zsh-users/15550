Subject: Completion style like Vim
From: Michael Treibton <mtreibton@googlemail.com>

Hi all,

I'm wondering how i can get vim-like completion with zsh, and even if
it's possible?

For those who don't know, vim allows completion to happen on one line,
so if I have entered the following commands:

foobar hello
bar baz hello
zsh is cool
zsh is really cool

... and I were to type in:

zsh is

and then press the up or down arrow keys, I would see as completion:

zsh is cool
zsh is really cool

which would be cycled through on the single line -- that is, without
presenting the completion menu.

Is something like this possible with zsh (and I assume zle?)  Note
that I already use the following bindings:

bindkey '\e[5~' beginning-of-buffer-or-history
bindkey '\e[6~' end-of-buffer-or-history
bindkey "^[n" history-search-forward
bindkey "^[p" history-search-backward

Which don't quite do what I want.

Is this possible at all?  I hope I've explained this well enough.

Thanks!

Michael
