<H1 ID="S1"><SPAN CLASS="chapnum">1</SPAN> Operating Information</H1>
<H2 ID="S1.1">General</H2>
<P>This chapter provides an overview of how the VT102 video terminal operates.
The text describes all controls, indicators, and general operating
procedures. Detailed operating information depends on the computer and
its application software.</P>
<H2 ID="S1.2">Terminal Operation</H2>
<P>The terminal operates either on-line, off-line, or in SET-UP. You select on-line
and off-line in SET-UP. <A HREF="chapter3.html">Chapter 3</A> describes SET-UP and provides information
about selecting on-line and off-line.</P>
<P>When the ON LINE indicator is on, the terminal can communicate with the
computer. When on-line, the terminal serves as both an input and output
device of the computer. <A HREF="figure1-1.html">Figure 1-1</A> shows a general block diagram of the
terminal while on-line.</P>
<P>As an input device, the terminal places keyboard-generated characters in
a keyboard character buffer. The characters are then taken from the buffer
and transmitted to the computer.</P>
<P>As an output device, the terminal places received characters in the input
character buffer for processing. When processing, the terminal removes
the received characters from the buffer and either displays or prints them.</P>
<P>When the OFF LINE indicator is on, the terminal cannot communicate with
the computer. Characters typed on the keyboard appear on the screen.
<A HREF="figure1-2.html">Figure 1-2</A> shows a general block diagram of the terminal while off-line.</P>
<P>An optional serial printer connects to the terminal's printer interface.
Therefore, you can produce printed copy without a separate communication
line and interface to the computer. The printer can print when the
terminal is on- or off-line.</P>
<H2 ID="S1.3">Controls and Indicators</H2>
<P>The terminal has five groups of controls and indicators: monitor controls,
communication switches, keyboard controls, visual indicators, and audible
indicators.</P>
<H3 ID="S1.3.1">Monitor Controls</H3>
<P>The terminal has two controls on the monitor backpanel, the voltage selection
switch and the power switch (<A HREF="figure1-3.html">Figure 1-3</A>). The following paragraphs
describe these monitor controls.</P>
<H4 ID="S1.3.1.1">Voltage Selection Switch</H4>
<P>This switch allows the terminal to operate
with available ac input voltage range. If you change the switch position,
you must also change the fuse. The switch position and fuse are selected
when the terminal is installed. See <A HREF="chapter7.html">Chapter 7</A> for more information about
installing the terminal.</P>
<P CLASS="note">CAUTION: You may damage the terminal if you set the voltage selection
switch to the wrong position and use the wrong fuse.</P>
<H4 ID="S1.3.1.2">Power Switch</H4>
<P>This switch controls ac power to the terminal. When ac
power is on, either the ON LINE or OFF LINE indicator is on. See <A HREF="#S1.3.4">Keyboard
Indicators</A> in this chapter for more information.</P>
<P>Turn the terminal on (power up) by using the following procedure.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Turn the power switch to the on (1) position (<A HREF="figure1-3.html">Figure 1-3</A>). The terminal
automatically runs a power-up self-test to verify terminal operation.
The test provides the following indications:
<UL>
<LI>All indicators come on and go off; either the ON LINE or OFF LINE
indicator stays on.
<P CLASS="note">NOTE: The on or off state of other indicators depends on the
communication signals received and terminal features selected.</P></LI>
<LI>A bell tone sounds.</LI>
<LI>The cursor appears in the upper-left corner of the screen.</LI>
</UL>
<P>If the test finds an error, the terminal provides one of the following
indications.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Does not perform the above sequence</LI>
<LI>Displays character(s) on the screen</LI>
<LI>Sounds several bell tones</LI>
</UL></LI>
</OL>
<P>See <A HREF="chapter9.html">Chapter 9</A> if the terminal does not power up correctly.</P>
<H3 ID="S1.3.2">Internal Communication Switches</H3>
<P>The terminal has two types of internal switches, communication switches
and 20 mA current loop option switches. The following paragraphs describe
these switches.</P>
<H4 ID="S1.3.2.1">Communication Switches</H4>
<P>These ten switches select the communication
lines used by the modem connector. The switches are set during
installation. See <A HREF="chapter7.html">Chapter 7</A> for the selection procedure.</P>
<H4 ID="S1.3.2.2">20 mA Current Loop Option Switches</H4>
<P>The 20 mA current loop option
(VT1XX-CA) has two switches that select active or normal (passive) operation
for the transmitter and receiver. See <A HREF="chapter8.html">Chapter 8</A> for more information
about the 20 mA current loop option.</P>
<H3 ID="S1.3.3">Keyboard Controls</H3>
<P>The terminal keyboard has a main keyboard and numeric keypad (<A HREF="figure1-4.html">Figure
1-4</A>). The main keyboard looks and operates like a standard typewriter.
The numeric keypad allows rapid entry of numeric data or function characters
(used with some application software). The keys are divided into
four groups: standard keys, function keys, printing keys, and SET-UP
keys.</P>
<H4 ID="S1.3.3.1">Standard Keys</H4>
<P><A HREF="figure1-5.html">Figure 1-5</A> identifies the standard typewriter and calculator
keys. The computer can select the numeric keypad to generate the
same characters as the main keyboard. The minus, comma, period, and
numeric keys on the keypad operate like the corresponding unshifted
keys on the keyboard.</P>
<P><SPAN CLASS="keyname">SHIFT</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="keyname">CAPS LOCK</SPAN> modify standard key characters. They do not
modify numeric keypad characters. The following paragraphs describe <SPAN CLASS="keyname">SHIFT</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="keyname">CAPS LOCK</SPAN>. <A HREF="chapter4.html">Chapter 4</A> describes all the characters generated
by the standard keys.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="keys/br/shift1.png" ALT="" HEIGHT="40" WIDTH="94"> <STRONG>SHIFT</STRONG><BR>
When you hold down <SPAN CLASS="keyname">SHIFT</SPAN>, the standard keys on the main keyboard generate
uppercase characters. You can also use <SPAN CLASS="keyname">SHIFT</SPAN> with the function,
printing, and SET-UP keys. See the following paragraphs in this chapter
for more information.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="keys/br/capslock.png" ALT="" HEIGHT="40" WIDTH="72"> <STRONG>CAPS LOCK</STRONG><BR>
This is a two-position locking key. If you lock down <SPAN CLASS="keyname">CAPS LOCK</SPAN>, the alphabetic
keys generate uppercase characters. If you release <SPAN CLASS="keyname">CAPS
LOCK</SPAN>, the alphabetic keys generate lowercase characters. <SPAN CLASS="keyname">CAPS LOCK</SPAN>
does not affect the function and numeric keypad keys.</P>
<P CLASS="note">NOTE: <SPAN CLASS="keyname">CAPS LOCK</SPAN> does not affect the numeric and special symbol
keys. Therefore, <SPAN CLASS="keyname">CAPS LOCK</SPAN> does not operate like the <SPAN CLASS="keyname">SHIFT LOCK</SPAN> of a
typewriter.</P>
<H4 ID="S1.3.3.2">Function Keys</H4>
<P><A HREF="figure1-6.html">Figure 1-6</A> identifies the function keys. The computer
can also select the numeric keypad to generate function characters. The
application software or communication system define the use of function
keys. <A HREF="chapter4.html">Chapter 4</A> describes all the characters generated by the function
keys. The following paragraphs provide a general description of each
function key.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="keys/br/noscroll.png" ALT="" HEIGHT="40" WIDTH="40"> <STRONG>NO SCROLL</STRONG><BR>
This key controls scrolling on the screen. Scrolling is the upward or downward
movement of existing lines on the screen to allow new lines to appear.
When you first press this key, scrolling stops and new characters
cannot appear. When pressed again, scrolling continues and new characters
can appear.</P>
<P CLASS="note">NOTE: <SPAN CLASS="keyname">NO SCROLL</SPAN> operates only in full-duplex communication with the
auto XON/XOFF SET-UP feature on. This key does not operate with the
auto XON/XOFF feature off or with half-duplex communication.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="keys/br/breakhereis.png" ALT="" HEIGHT="40" WIDTH="40"> <STRONG>BREAK/HERE IS</STRONG><BR>
This key generates a break when the break enable SET-UP feature is on.
See <A HREF="chapter3.html">Chapter 3</A> for more information about SET-UP features and <A HREF="chapter6.html">Chapter 6</A>
for more information about break.</P>
<P>When you hold down <SPAN CLASS="keyname">SHIFT</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="keyname">BREAK</SPAN> generates a long break disconnect.
With some modems, a long break disconnect causes a communication
(phone) line disconnect. See <A HREF="chapter6.html#S6.2.3">Break</A> in <A HREF="chapter6.html">Chapter 6</A> for more information
about long break disconnects.</P>
<P>When you hold down <SPAN CLASS="keyname">CTRL</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="keyname">HERE IS</SPAN> transmits the answerback message.
The answerback message identifies the terminal to the computer. You enter
the answerback message in SET-UP. See <A HREF="chapter3.html">Chapter 3</A> for more information
about the answerback SET-UP feature.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="keys/br/arrows.png" ALT="[Up] [Down] [Left] [Right]" HEIGHT="40" WIDTH="172"> <STRONG>Cursor Control Keys</STRONG><BR>
These keys are defined by the application software. However, they usually
generate cursor control commands. The cursor is a screen indicator
showing the line and column where the next character will appear.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="keys/br/esc.png" ALT="" HEIGHT="40" WIDTH="40"> <STRONG>ESC</STRONG><BR>
This key generates the escape (ESC) control character, defined by the
application software.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="keys/br/tab.png" ALT="" HEIGHT="40" WIDTH="60"> <STRONG>TAB</STRONG><BR>
This key generates the tab (TAB) control character, defined by the application
software.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="keys/br/ctrl.png" ALT="" HEIGHT="40" WIDTH="40"> <STRONG>CTRL</STRONG><BR>
When you hold down <SPAN CLASS="keyname">CTRL</SPAN>, pressing another key may generate a control
character defined by the application software. <A HREF="chapter4.html">Chapter 4</A> describes the
control character.</P>
<P>You can also use <SPAN CLASS="keyname">CTRL</SPAN> with the <SPAN CLASS="keyname">HERE IS</SPAN> and printing keys. See the description
of these keys in this chapter for more information.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="keys/br/backspace.png" ALT="" HEIGHT="40" WIDTH="40"> <STRONG>BACK SPACE</STRONG><BR>
This key generates the back space (BS) control character, defined by the
application software.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="keys/br/delete.png" ALT="" HEIGHT="40" WIDTH="40"> <STRONG>DELETE</STRONG><BR>
This key generates the delete (DEL) control character, defined by the application
software.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="keys/br/return1.png" ALT="" HEIGHT="84" WIDTH="60"> <STRONG>RETURN</STRONG><BR>
This key generates either a carriage return, or carriage return and linefeed.
The linefeed/new line SET-UP feature selects the characters generated.
See <A HREF="chapter3.html">Chapter 3</A> for more information about this feature.</P>
<P>When using half-duplex coded control (HDX B), <SPAN CLASS="keyname">RETURN</SPAN> may also automatically
generate a line turnaround character. Setting the auto turnaround
SET-UP feature selects automatic generation. Setting the turnaround/disconnect
character SET-UP feature selects the turnaround
character. See <A HREF="chapter3.html">Chapter 3</A> for more information about these features.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="keys/br/linefeed.png" ALT="" HEIGHT="40" WIDTH="40"> <STRONG>LINE FEED</STRONG><BR>
This key generates the linefeed (LF) control character, defined by the application
software.</P>
<H4 ID="S1.3.3.3">Printing Keys</H4>
<P><A HREF="figure1-7.html">Figure 1-7</A> identifies the keys that control printing. The
optional serial printer can print when the terminal is on- or off-line. The
following paragraph describes the (<SPAN CLASS="keyname">PRINT</SPAN>) key. See <A HREF="chapter2.html">Chapter 2</A> for more
information about printing operations.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="keys/br/printenter.png" ALT="" HEIGHT="84" WIDTH="40"> <STRONG>(PRINT)/ENTER</STRONG><BR>
This key works with <SPAN CLASS="keyname">CTRL</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="keyname">SHIFT</SPAN> to control printing. When you hold

<P>The following paragraphs describe the function of each indicator shown in
<A HREF="figure1-9.html">Figure 1-9</A>.</P>
<P><STRONG>ON LINE</STRONG><BR>
This indicator is on when the terminal is on-line and can communicate with
the computer. Either ON LINE or OFF LINE is on when power is on.</P>
<P CLASS="note">NOTE: Depending on the type of communication selected, the terminal
may not communicate with the computer until a communication line connection
exists. See <A HREF="chapter6.html">Chapter 6</A> for more information about communication
types.</P>
<P><STRONG>OFF LINE</STRONG><BR>
This indicator is on when the terminal is off-line and cannot communicate
with the computer. When off-line, the terminal displays keyboard characters
on the screen. Either ON LINE or OFF LINE is on when the power is
on.</P>
<P><STRONG>KBD LOCKED</STRONG><BR>
This indicator is on during a keyboard locked condition. This means the
keyboard character buffer is full and cannot accept more keyboard characters.
The keyboard character buffer holds keyboard characters until the
terminal transmits them to the computer (<A HREF="figure1-1.html">Figure 1-1</A>). If KBD LOCKED is
on, keyboard characters are lost. If the keyclick SET-UP feature is on,
keys will not generate keyclicks.</P>
<P CLASS="note">NOTE: The terminal can receive characters from the computer during
the keyboard locked condition.</P>
<P>There are several causes for the keyboard locked condition (<A HREF="table1-1.html">Table 1-1</A>).
Each cause has a method to clear the keyboard locked condition. When
the condition clears, the terminal can transmit characters to the computer
and the KBD LOCKED indicator goes off. If the keyclick SET-UP feature is
on, keys will generate keyclicks.</P>
<P><STRONG>CTS</STRONG><BR>
This indicator shows the on and off condition of the clear to send (CTS) or
secondary clear to send (SCTS) modem connector signals. The internal
communication switches select the connector signal used. See <A HREF="chapter6.html">Chapter 6</A>
for more information about the communication signals and internal communication
switches.</P>
<P CLASS="note">NOTE: If the 20 mA current loop option (VT1XX-CA) is installed, the CTS
signal is not used.</P>
<P><STRONG>DSR</STRONG><BR>
This indicator shows the on and off state of the data set ready (DSR)
modem connector signal. This signal is on when the local modem (connected
to the terminal) is ready to communicate. If the signal is off, the
modem cannot communicate.</P>
<P CLASS="note">NOTE: If the 20 mA current loop option (VT1XX-CA) is installed, the DSR
signal is not used.</P>
<P><STRONG>INSERT</STRONG><BR>
This indicator shows when the terminal is in insert or replace mode. The
computer selects these modes. In insert mode, INSERT is on. The terminal
inserts new characters at the cursor position. Characters displayed to
the right of the cursor move to the right. Characters moved past the right
margin are lost.</P>
<P>In replace mode, INSERT is off. The terminal writes new characters over
the current display characters at the cursor position.</P>
<P><STRONG>L1</STRONG><BR>
This indicator is turned on and off by the computer. Therefore, the application
software defines the meaning of L1.</P>
<H3 ID="S1.3.5">Audible Indicators</H3>
<P>There are three audible indicators: a keyclick, a bell tone, and a series of
bell tones. The following paragraphs describe these indicators.</P>
<H4 ID="S1.3.5.1">Keyclick</H4>
<P>A keyclick sounds when you press a key, with the following
exceptions.</P>
<UL>
<LI>You press <SPAN CLASS="keyname">SHIFT</SPAN> or <SPAN CLASS="keyname">CTRL</SPAN>. These keys do not generate a keyclick
because they do not generate characters. They modify the characters
generated by other keys.</LI>
<LI>KBD LOCKED is on; characters from the keyboard are lost.</LI>
<LI>The keyclick SET-UP feature is off.</LI>
</UL>
<H4 ID="S1.3.5.2">Bell Tone</H4>
<P>A bell tone sounds in each of the following cases.</P>
<UL>
<LI>The terminal receives a bell character from the computer.</LI>
<LI>The cursor is eight characters away from the right margin and the
margin SET-UP feature is on.</LI>
</UL>
<H4 ID="S1.3.5.3">Series of Bell Tones</H4>
<P>A series of bell tones sounds to indicate a problem
in storing or recalling the SET-UP features in user memory. If the terminal
has a problem, it automatically uses the default SET-UP feature selections.
See <A HREF="chapter3.html">Chapter 3</A> for more information about the SET-UP feature memories.</P>
