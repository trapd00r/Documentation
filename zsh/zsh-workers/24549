} This sounds very familiar.

This can be controlled with styles.  If you tell zsh to put external
commands and aliases in separate completion groups, then it doesn't
attempt to resolve duplications across groups.  If you let it put all
the completions together, then it de-dups them.

You can't, at present, have it both ways.
