<TD>LOCAL/REMOTE Switch</TD>
<TD><P>This switch is located on the right front of the VT05.
In LOCAL mode, the terminal is off-line and data
transmitted from the keyboard is applied back to the
VT05 receiver logic by connecting the transmitter
output to the VT05 receiver input. In REMOTE
mode, keyboard data is transmitted from the VT05 to
the processor while the VT05 is simultaneously receiving
data from the processor for entry into the
buffer memory (full-duplex operation).</P>
<P>When operating in HALF-DUPLEX mode, if inputs are
received from both the VT05 transmitter and the computer
simultaneously, the two inputs will be mixed or
garbled.</P></TD>

<H2 ID="S3.2">3.2 Turn-On Procedures</H2>
<P>Before proceeding with the turn-on procedure, the operator should reread <A HREF="#S3.1">Paragraph 3.1</A> pertaining to
system controls and indicators.</P>
<DIV CLASS="note"><P CLASS="notetype">CAUTION</P>
<P>Approximately one minute after the power ON/OFF
switch is turned on the screen should display the cursor.
Turn power OFF if the cursor does not appear
within this time period.</P></DIV>
<H3 ID="S3.2.1">3.2.1 Local Operation Turn-On Procedure</H3>
<P>The following procedure is provided for initial turn-on when operating in LOCAL mode. Perform step
3 of this procedure only during initialisation or initial step, or in instances when the VT05 must be
moved to a different location and a different wall receptacle must be used.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Ensure the power switch is set to the OFF position.</LI>
<LI>Set the LOCAL/REMOTE switch to the LOCAL position.</LI>
<LI>Check the selected wall receptacle for the correct line voltage.
Ensure the line voltage and frequency agree with the line voltage
and frequency specified on the rear panel. Insert the power cord
into the wall receptacle.</LI>
<LI>Set the power switch to ON; the blinking cursor will appear in the
HOME position (the first character position of the first line), and
the speaker will "beep" once.</LI>
<LI>Allow approximately one minute for CRT filament warmup.</LI>
<LI>If the cursor does not appear as specified, press the HOME key. If
the cursor still fails to appear, ensure that the BRIGHTNESS control
has not been adjusted too low. If the cursor still fails to appear,
turn the terminal off and contact the local DEC Field Service Office.</LI>
<LI>All keyboard functions previously described will be operational.
They may be verified individually by pressing each key while observing
the screen.</LI>
</OL>
<H3 ID="S3.2.2">3.2.2 Remote Operation Turn-On Procedure</H3>
<P>The following procedure is provided for initial turn-on when operating in REMOTE mode. Perform step
4 of this procedure only during installation or initial setup, or if the VT05 is moved to a different location
and a different wall receptacle must be used.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Ensure the power switch is set to the OFF position.</LI>
<LI>Set the DUPLEX switch on the rear panel to FULL or HALF according
to the requirements of the particular system to which the VT05
is connected.</LI>
<LI>Set the LOCAL/REMOTE switch to the REMOTE position.</LI>
<LI>Check the selected wall receptacle for the correct line voltage and
frequency as specified on the rear panel of the VT05. Insert the
power cord into the wall receptacle.</LI>
<LI>Set the power switch to the ON position.</LI>
<LI>If Step 5 is performed, allow approximately one minute for CRT
filament warmup before continuing. The blinking cursor should appear
in the HOME position (upper left-hand corner), and the
speaker should "beep" once.</LI>
<LI>If the cursor fails to appear as specified, press the HOME key. Ensure
that the BRIGHTNESS adjustment has not been turned down. If
the cursor still fails to appear, turn the terminal off and call the
local DEC Field Service Office.</LI>
<LI>Set the BAUD RATE switch on the rear panel to the desired position.</LI>
<LI>All keyboard functions and receiver functions previously described
will be operational, and the VT05 is set up for "on-line" operation.
Correct system operation can be verified by pressing the various
control and displayable characters keys individually while observing
the display.</LI>
</OL>
<H2 ID="S3.3">3.3 Modes of Operation</H2>
<P>For normal operation, the LOCAL/REMOTE switch is set to the REMOTE position. The LOCAL mode
is provided to enable the VT05 to be operated off-line for training, maintenance, troubleshooting,
and alignment purposes.</P>
<H3 ID="S3.3.1">3.3.1 LOCAL Mode</H3>
<P>In LOCAL mode, the terminal is off-line, and the transmitter as well as the receiver is disconnected from
the external output and input lines. Transmitted data from the keyboard is fed back to the terminal
receiver by connecting the terminal (transmitter) output to the terminal (receiver) input (see <A HREF="#F3-2">Figure
3-2</A>). This is accomplished by setting the LOCAL/REMOTE switch to the LOCAL position.</P>
<H3 ID="S3.3.2">3.3.2 REMOTE Mode</H3>
<P>For normal operation, set the LOCAL/REMOTE switch in the REMOTE (on-line) position. In REMOTE
mode, with the DUPLEX switch set to FULL, the terminal transmits data from the terminal keyboard
directly to the processor while simultaneously receiving data to be entered into the terminal buffer
memory. A split-speed capability is provided in the REMOTE mode, because the timing circuits for
the input and output data are independent.</P>
<TABLE ID="F3-2" CLASS="figure">

</TR>
</TBODY>
</TABLE>
<H3 ID="S3.3.3">3.3.3 Full- and Half-Duplex Operation</H3>
<P>The FULL/HALF DUPLEX switch is located on the VT05 rear panel. When the switch is set to the
FULL-DUPLEX position, data transmitted from the keyboard will go to the computer only; the data
then may be repeated back to the display from the computer. When the switch is set to the HALF-DUPLEX
position, data is transmitted to the display at the same time it is transmitted to the computer.
The VT05 control logic then receives the information transmitted from the keyboard as well as from the
computer (see <A HREF="#F3-2">Figure 3-2</A>). The operator will have this in the FULL-DUPLEX position for most applications.</P>
<H2 ID="S3.4">3.4 Keyboard Operation</H2>
<P>The basic function of the keyboard is to provide a convenient, on-line means of transmitting U.S.
ASCII characters to the processor to be processed and displayed on the VT05 CRT display. The VT05
keyboard relative key positions and key markings are shown in <A HREF="chapter2.html#F2-1">Figure 2-1</A>. The VT05 transmit character
sets are provided in Tables <A HREF="chapter1.html#T1-1">1-1</A> and <A HREF="chapter1.html#T1-2">1-2</A>.</P>
<H3 ID="S3.4.1">3.4.1 Control Key Operation</H3>
<P>When the control (CTRL) key is pressed in conjunction with another key, bits 6 and 7 of that particular
key code are cleared to zero. The BELL and direct cursor addressing (CAD) functions are derived
through the use of the CTRL key, and are two functions that are especially useful. The BELL code or
function is generated by pressing the CTRL and "G" keys simultaneously. BELL causes an aural tone
or "beep" to be generated by the VT05 speaker each time the BELL code is received. This function is
especially useful as an aural indicator to gain the operator's attention, but should be used several
times in succession to distinguish between BELL and the end-of-line tone aural indicator.</P>
<P>The CAD function is generated by pressing the CTRL and "N" keys simultaneously. CAD operations
and applications are described in detail in <A HREF="#S3.9">Paragraph 3.9</A>.</P>
<H3 ID="S3.4.2">3.4.2 SHIFT Key Operation</H3>
<P>When the SHIFT key is pressed in conjunction with one of the VT05 displayable character keys, bit 6
is complemented if bit 7 is a logical 1 and bit 5 is complemented if bit 7 is a logical 0, and the upper
case equivalent of that particular character will be generated; e.g., "!" rather than "1", "A" rather
than "a", etc. (see <A HREF="chapter1.html#T1-1">Table 1-1</A> and <A HREF="chapter2.html#F2-1">Figure 2-1</A>). This rule applies to all characters transmitted from
the VT05 except control characters. All VT05 control characters are "SHIFT inhibited".</P>
<P>The (erase) LOCK key serves as an enabling key for the EOL and EOS keys (or functions) and must be
pressed simulataneously with the EOL and EOS keys. If the LOCK key is not pressed in conjunction
with EOL and EOS, those functions will be inhibited. This arrangement ensures that text on the display
screen will not be accidently erased if the operator presses the EOL or EOS key unintentionally.</P>
<H3 ID="S3.4.3">3.4.3 SHIFT/LOCK Key Operation</H3>
<P>When the SHIFT/LOCK key is used in SHIFT operation as described in <A HREF="#S3.4.2">Paragraph 3.4.2</A>, the SHIFT
function will be permanently enabled until the SHIFT/LOCK key is released.</P>
<H3 ID="S3.4.4">3.4.4 ALT Key Operation</H3>
<P>The ALT key is provided as an extra key to allow the operator alternatives, especially in programming
applications. The ALT key is more commonly used to allow the programmer an alternate "escape"
character code in instances where he does not wish to use carriage return or line feed; ALT may also be
used for other functions, according to the particular programming requirements. ALT code is ignored
when it is received by the VT05 and has no effect on the display.</P>
<H2 ID="S3.5">3.5 Display Operation</H2>
<P>The VT05 control functions are used for format control of the text, display erase applications, and cursor
movement.</P>
<H3 ID="S3.5.1">3.5.1 Cursor Left (<IMG SRC="arrowleft.png" ALT="[left]">)</H3>
<P>Cursor left (010<SUB>8</SUB>) causes the cursor to move left (or backspace) one character space each time the cursor
left code is received until the cursor reaches the left-hand margin (first character position). Receipt
of the cursor left code after the cursor reaches the left-hand margin has no effect, and the cursor
will remain in character position 1 of that particular line.</P>
<H3 ID="S3.5.2">3.5.2 Cursor Right (<IMG SRC="arrowright.png" ALT="[right]">)</H3>
<P>Cursor right (030<SUB>8</SUB>) causes the cursor to move right one character space each time the cursor right code
is received until the cursor reached the seventy-second character position of that line; receipt of the
code at this point has no effect and the cursor remains in character position 72 until another control
character code such as carriage return, line feed, etc., is received.</P>
<H3 ID="S3.5.3">3.5.3 Cursor Down (<IMG SRC="arrowdown.png" ALT="[down]">)</H3>
<P>Cursor down (013<SUB>8</SUB>) causes the cursor to move down one line until the cursor reaches the bottom line.
Once the cursor is in the bottom line, receipt of the cursor down code has no effect. (See <A HREF="chapter2.html#S2.7">Paragraph 2.7</A>.)</P>
<H3 ID="S3.5.4">3.5.4 Cursor Up (<IMG SRC="arrowup.png" ALT="[up]">)</H3>
<P>Cursor up (032<SUB>8</SUB>) causes the cursor to move up one line until the cursor reaches the top line. Once the
cursor has reached the top line, receipt of the cursor up code has no effect. (See <A HREF="chapter2.html#S2.7">Paragraph 2.7</A>.)</P>
<H3 ID="S3.5.5">3.5.5 HOME</H3>
<P>HOME (035<SUB>8</SUB>) causes the cursor to move to the first character position of the first line in the upper
left-hand corner of the screen. (See <A HREF="chapter2.html#S2.7">Paragraph 2.7</A>.)</P>
<H3 ID="S3.5.6">3.5.6 Horizontal Tab (TAB)</H3>
<P>TAB (011<SUB>8</SUB>) causes the cursor to move right to the next TAB stop each time the TAB code is received.
TAB stops are preset eight character spaces apart. TAB stop locations are at character positions 1, 9,
17, 25, 33, 41, 49, 57 and 65. Once the cursor reaches character position 65, all TAB commands
received thereafter will cause the cursor to move only one character position. Once the cursor reaches
character position 72, receipt of the TAB code has no effect.</P>
<H3 ID="S3.5.7">3.5.7 Erase-to-End-of-Line</H3>
<P>When the EOL key is pressed, all text from the cursor position (including data in the cursor position)
to the end of that particular line will be erased, and the cursor will remain in the current location.
For example, if the cursor is located in character position 30 of line 10 and the EOL key is pressed,
all text from character position 30 (including character position 30) to character position 72 of line 10
will be erased. Text or characters contained in all other lines will not be affected.</P>
<DIV CLASS="note"><P CLASS="notetype">NOTE</P>
<P>The (erase) LOCK key must be pressed at the same time
as the EOL and/or EOS key to enable the EOL and EOS
codes to be generated. If the (erase) LOCK key is not
pressed in conjunction with EOL and EOS, those functions
will be inhibited.</P></DIV>
<H3 ID="S3.5.8">3.5.8 Erase-to-End-of-Screen</H3>
<P>When the EOS key is pressed, all text from the cursor position (including data in the cursor position)
to the end of the screen will be erased, and the cursor will remain in the current location. For example,
if the cursor is positioned under character 7 of line 15 and the EOS key is pressed, all
text or data from the cursor position to the end of line 15 and all text or data contained in lines 16-20
will be erased. (See <A HREF="chapter2.html#S2.7">Paragraph 2.7</A>.)</P>
<H2 ID="S3.6">3.6 Automatic Functions</H2>
<P>In addition to the control character functions, the VT05 also has three automatic functions: scroll,
end-of-line tone, and cursor advance.</P>
<H3 ID="S3.6.1">3.6.1 Automatic Scrolling</H3>
<P>When the cursor is located in the last character line (line 20) and a linefeed code is received the following
will occur: all displayed data will move up one line and any data contained in the top line
will disappear or "scroll" off the screen, and data contained in this line will be erased from the display
refresh memory.</P>
<P>The term "automatic scrolling" should not be construed to mean that text contained on the screen will
scroll or move up one line once a character is generated in character position 72 of a given line.
Automatic scrolling will not occur if a linefeed is generated with the cursor located in any line other
than line 20.</P>
<P>Automatic scrolling is useful for programming applications, especially when a large amount of data is
transmitted from the computer to the VT05 to be received and displayed.</P>
<H3 ID="S3.6.2">3.6.2 Automatic Cursor Advance</H3>
<P>When a displayable character is received, the character is displayed and the cursor automatically
moves right to the next character location until the cursor reaches character position 72; at this point,
received characters will still be displayed by directly replacing the character in position 72,
but it will have no effect on the cursor.</P>
<H3 ID="S3.6.3">3.6.3 End-of-Line Tone</H3>
<P>A speaker in the VT05 generates an aural tone or "beep" on reaching character position 65. This
function serves as an end-of-line indication or warning (8 spaces before the end of line).</P>
<DIV CLASS="note"><P CLASS="notetype">NOTE</P>
<P>Automatic carriage return or line feed is purposely not
used in the VT05; these functions must be included as
part of the program. Should automatic carriage return
or line feed be required for special applications, contact
the DEC Field Service Department.</P></DIV>
<H2 ID="S3.7">3.7 Display Erase</H2>
<P>There are four methods that are used for display erase: character deletion, direct character replacement,
erase-to-end-of-line, and erase-to-end-of-screen.</P>
<H3 ID="S3.7.1">3.7.1 Individual Character Deletion</H3>
<P>The first method is erasure of individual characters by using SPACE (040<SUB>8</SUB>). When the cursor is placed
under an existing character and the SPACE character code is received, the character will be deleted.</P>
<H3 ID="S3.7.2">3.7.2 Direct Character Replacement</H3>
<P>The second method is replacement of an existing or displayed character with a transmitted character.
For example, if the cursor is positioned under an existing character such as "A" and the character "E"
is received, "A" will be replaced by "E". Thus, this method uses a one-for-one character replacement
as opposed to the first method, which deletes the character leaving the character position blank.</P>
<H3 ID="S3.7.3">3.7.3 Erase-to-End-of-Line and Erase-to-End-of-Screen</H3>
<P>The EOL and EOS functions are described in detail in Paragraphs <A HREF="#S3.5.7">3.5.7</A> and <A HREF="#S3.5.8">3.5.8</A>.</P>
<H2 ID="S3.8">3.8 Direct Cursor Addressing (CAD)</H2>
<P>Through the use of CAD (016<SUB>8</SUB>), the cursor can be directed to any one of the 1440 character locations
on the CRT screen using three instructions. The CAD function is used to allow updating of displayed
data without retransmitting the complete page. For example, if the cursor is located in character location
55 of line 18 and the operator wishes to update information beginning at character location 35
of line 9, transmission time would be greater if the operator used the cursor control characters, e.g.,
"cursor up" and "cursor left" to move to the new location. By using the CAD function and the codes
shown in <A HREF="#T3-3">Table 3-3</A>, the cursor can be quickly directed to any of the 1440 character locations on the
screen. A reduction in generation time is especially noticeable when CAD-generated data is retrieved
from memory.</P>
<P>CAD is received by the VT05, and the next two data words are interpreted as the Y- and X-address.
The Y-data word presets the Y-address counter to the selected character line, and the X-data word
presets the X-address counter to the selected character position in the selected line. Once the cursor
is moved to the new location (or address), the cycle is complete and the next data word received will
perform its normal function. (See <A HREF="chapter2.html#S2.7">Paragraph 2.7</A>.)</P>

<P>Periodic preventive maintenance should be performed, and care and good judgment should be exercised
to ensure proper equipment operation.</P>
<H3 ID="S3.9.1">3.9.1 Cleaning the VT05</H3>
<P>The exterior surfaces may be cleaned using a damp cloth and a mild detergent. Only a very soft cloth
should be used to avoid scratching the protective screen used on the face of the CRT.</P>
<P>The VT05 also contains small air exhaust vents and an internal fan is used to provide constantly circulating
air for cooling. These vents must remain clean and unobstructed to allow adequate cooling.
Should the vents become obstructed, premature component failure may occur due to an increase in the
internal temperature.</P>
<H3 ID="S3.9.2">3.9.2 Relocating the VT05</H3>
<P>If the VT05 is moved from the location at which it is originally installed to a new location, the wall
receptacle to be used at the new location should be checked to ensure the line voltage and frequency
agree with the requirements specified on the rear panel of the VT05.</P>
<H3 ID="S3.9.3">3.9.3 Maintenance</H3>
<P>If a malfunction occurs, the user should contact the local DEC Field Service Office. The VT05 cover
should not be removed nor maintenance performed except by qualified maintenance personnel.</P>
