I would like to do something like that but that creates a new group
name. for me it's not with vtex at all, but for kghostview (a gv like)

I would like to have two groups :

---- PostScript or PDF files

printing on my screen before the file list.
(btw I have the correct formats in my .zshrc)

is that possible ?
