I am using 'exec' to invoke a different executable from within my zsh
script.  I think that this is preventing the temp file from being
removed.  I have control of the other executable, and so I now can pass
the name of the temp file as an argument to this executable, who now
explicitly removes it.

And I should add I deliberately want to replace my script with the other
executable, which is why I'm using 'exec'.
