This has always been a horrible botch up.  There's only one set of numbers
in the param struct, and only one number passed down with a typeset
options: either it functions as a base, or it functions as a fill size.
It can be fixed at the expense of a larger struct pm and with more
communication between the builtin parser and bin_typeset().
