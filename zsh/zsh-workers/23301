I've encountered a wee problem with this, and I do mean wee -- the time it
took me to spot this proves my font is too small for my powers of vision.

$ zsh-4.3.4-dev-0 -f
% zcompile -z share/zsh/4.3.4-dev-0/functions/add-zsh-hook
zsh: parse error near `else'
zcompile: can't read file: share/zsh/4.3.4-dev-0/functions/add-zsh-hook

This fixes it:
