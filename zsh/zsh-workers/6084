Subject: foo=<TAB> always gives context array_value
Date: Fri, 23 Apr 1999 16:57:22 +0200
From: Peter Stephenson <pws@ibmth.df.unipi.it>

It seems that if I try to complete after an assignment, e.g.
  foo=<TAB>
(with new completion, obviously) $compstate[context] is always array_value,
even if there is a character which is not `(' after the =.

Presumably the correct behaviour is that context `value' is assumed unless
there is a ( present.

(Probably this didn't get noticed because there is no default -value-
handler.)
