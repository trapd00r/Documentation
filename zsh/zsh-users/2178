Hi,

When I don't use my Z-shell on a remote computer for a while, I get
disconnected (after about 15 minutes):

   markko @ kunhp1>Read from remote host kunhp1.cogsci.kun.nl: Connection reset by peer
   Connection to kunhp1.cogsci.kun.nl closed.


In ~/.zshrc I have:

   TMOUT=0

I use zsh-3.0.5. Anyone knows how to avoid this little nasty thing?

Thanx in advance,
Mark.
