What do you mean with previous command? After a command
terminates a new prompt is issued and Zsh starts counting. If you
type some text and stop without pressing enter TMOUT also kills
the session.

This doesn't affect running programs, they are not stopped even
if you are idle for longer than TMOUT. Only when you are at the
shell and no programs are running. It looks like suspended
programs are killed though.
