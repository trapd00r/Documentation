Consistancy.  I've used this alias and others, with job control under
several shells, for many years.

If I type it on the command line, it's job %1.
If I make it a zsh alias, without the $*, then it's job %1.
When I used csh/tcsh, my alias created job %1.
When I used bash, my function (same as zsh function) created job %1.

In general, when I put something in the background (nothing else already
there) then I expect it to be job %1.

Why does a function take up a job slot?
And if it does, why doesn't 'exec' work?

thanks,
gm
