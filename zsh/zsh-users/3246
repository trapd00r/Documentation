now that i took a look I am still well behind the idea of
coloring something where i did 
`compdef _use_lo x command_with_--help.'

I thought that looking for a group with control-x h might help
but when i used

zstyle '*:options' list-colors '=l*=34:=v*=35'

I have not been any more successful. I guess, i am deep under and
might not see the light soon %). so perhaps a last try from your
site to help me with the specific problem of coloring something,
which has got `compdef _use_lo x command_with_--help' ?

I had no problem to color with hosts like:
zstyle '*:hosts' list-colors '=l*=34:=w*=35'
but here i know that '*:hosts' is successful.
