Yes ... but I think it's indirect, something stored in *amatches rather
than amatches itself.

I agree there doesn't appear to be anything wrong with that patch, but it
also doesn't quite fix things.  I no longer get a reproducible core dump,
but now menu-select is a silent no-op.  (The minimal zshrc used so far is
still necessary to reproduce anything, as soon as I use my full startup I
get normal menu selection.)
