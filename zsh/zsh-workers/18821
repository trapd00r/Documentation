Hi,

Are you aware that the mailserver setup for zsh.org is broken? It
returns an error about the domain zsh.org not being in its rcpthosts
file (so I guess it's running qmail :-)

I've had some problems reaching people with a @zsh.org email because of
this..

If you would like to, sunsite.dk would happily host mail for zsh.org..
We have a running qmailadmin setup which is a webbased control panel
letting you set up POP-boxes, forwards, mailinglists etc..

Regards from,
Martin Dalum
