Is there a way to make spelling correction take into account the
completions (e.g. do not attempt to correct to an existing filename
if the completion won't give a filename)?

Otherwise, could refused corrections be kept in a history, so that
zsh no longer ask for them? It should be a list of couples (%R,%r):
(string, proposed correction).
