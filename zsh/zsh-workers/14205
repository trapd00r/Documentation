Could we maybe have the usual _is_gnu tests in this? I've only got
access to Solaris today and there, loadkeys takes only one parameter -
a file name - so default completion would be best. /usr/share/keymaps
doesn't even exist on Solaris. 

If you want, leave it to me and I'll do the change but it may be a few
days before I get a chance to.
