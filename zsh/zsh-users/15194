No it does not.
BeOS never had any /usr.
Haiku doesn't either.

It's just used because people "saw" env being put there more often than =
python or perl of whatever, but it doesn't mean they looked to all =
possible places.
It has just more chances of working but it's not a guarantee.

Being official doesn't mean it's correct or works.
