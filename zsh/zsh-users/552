Be careful with that.  Zsh was not designed to run setuid scripts although
some attempt was made to make is somewhat secure.  I do hope that the
script you wrote is secure but I cannot guarantee that zsh has no bugs that
can be exploited to gain root privileges.  And I would not run ypcat and
grep with 0 euid.  I would use this:
