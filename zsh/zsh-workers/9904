Subject: PATCH: RMSTARSILENT


... or, more precisely, getquery() and noquery().

Doing `rm *' didn't work for me any more because getquery() always
retunred immediatly with `n'. Although this makes `rm *' really save,
I think it shouldn't do that. The problem was in noquery():

  int
  noquery(int purge)
  {
      int c, val = 0;

  #ifdef FIONREAD
      ioctl(SHTTY, FIONREAD, (char *)&val);
      if (purge) {
	  while(val--)
	      read(SHTTY, &c, 1);
      }
  #endif

      return val;
  }

So, with FIONREAD and purge!=0, we always returned -1. That was wrong, 
wasn't it?

Bye
 Sven
