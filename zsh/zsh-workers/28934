Patches are text/* ...except when they're not.

Working on a daily basis with a codebase containing inconsistent line 
endings (CRLF and LF), I see the rationale.  application/octet-stream is 
my preference in that case.  It allows the Windows devs to cleanly apply 
my patches and vice versa.  And since it works fine in the 
consistent-line-endings case, there's no reason to use two different 
methods.  (I do, though, since I use `git` whenever possible; `git svn` 
at work, where I deal with the aforementioned madness.)
