Hi
I have some global aliases which call scripts such that I can write

> cp NF ND
Where NF copies the newest file to ND the newest directory
these are relative to current directory

I'd like to be able to generalise this ie

> cp /tmp/NF /store/ND

Obviously the above cannot work but any (lateral) ideas?
