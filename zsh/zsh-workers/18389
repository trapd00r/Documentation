Subject: PATCH: extra loop tests
Date: Wed, 26 Mar 2003 14:16:41 +0000
Message-ID: <20706.1048688201@csr.com>
From: Peter Stephenson <pws@csr.com>

Tests for the enhanced `for' syntax as well as `select' which is now
testable (according to `cvs annotate', I fixed it all of three years ago,
except as we know it was broken for a large fraction of that time
because of the for-loop change.  A year is a short time in zsh
development).

Extra tests gratefully received, as Felix reminded us, particularly for
interactive stuff (zle, completion) which I will not be attempting
myself.

When we finally get the multiple defined limits problem fixed, I will
produce a test version of 4.1.1.  If tests continue to trickle in, so
much the better.
