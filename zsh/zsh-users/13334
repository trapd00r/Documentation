Your version does not print any colors, for me with zsh 4.3.6 from Debian
unstable. I tried it both with my on RC file and with zsh -f under
Konsole 4.1.2 and xterm 237.

  echotc Co

returns 8. Manually setting colours to 8 does not yield any results, either.


But then, as you said, I should probably do something else, as well ;)
