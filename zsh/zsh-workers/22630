Subject: zstyle is badly broken as of 20060817

schaefer<532> zstyle ':completion:*' list-prompt ''
schaefer<533> zstyle -L | grep list-prompt 
zstyle ':completion:*' list-prompt ''
schaefer<534> zstyle -d ':completion:*' list-prompt
schaefer<535> zstyle | grep list-prompt
list-prompt
schaefer<536> zstyle -L | grep list-prompt
schaefer<537> 

So the list-prompt style is still there even after supposedly being deleted,
but zstyle -L does not list it (and completion behaves as if it is still
set, which is how I even noticed).

schaefer<545> zstyle -s ":completion:${curcontext}:default" list-prompt tmp
schaefer<546> echo $?
0

It's as if it is set with a pattern of "*".
