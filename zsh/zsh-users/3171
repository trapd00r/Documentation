Subject: ever-expanding ZLS_COLORS

Hi,

I got the following style command from this list a little while ago.
It was given as an example of colored completion.

    zstyle ':completion:*:zsh-options' \
           list-colors '=csh*=31:=*hist*=32:=list*=34:=*glob*=35'

Now, everytime I attempt a completion which uses zsh-options, it seems
ZLS_COLORS just continues to grow:

No completion:
 di=33

After first completion:
 (zsh-options)=csh*=31:=*hist*=32:=list*=34:=*glob*=35:(zsh-options)\
 =csh*=31:=*hist*=32:=list*=34:=*glob*=35:di=33

After second completion:
 (zsh-options)=csh*=31:=*hist*=32:=list*=34:=*glob*=35:(zsh-options)\
 =csh*=31:=*hist*=32:=list*=34:=*glob*=35:(zsh-options)=csh*=31:=*hist*=32:\
 =list*=34:=*glob*=35:di=33
 

Eventually, ZLS_COLORS grows too long for whatever processing is done
(I think awk ends up complaining).  Is there something I can do to
prevent this behavior?

Thanks,
  Matt
