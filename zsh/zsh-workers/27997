Yes, as you'll see from the comment just above the code I changed, I had
upgraded it from a warning to an error, since it doesn't mean "the shell
programmer didn't get around to setting this variable" it means "something
nasty happened such that this variable that you were expecting to implement
special behaviour is never going to do what you expect".  I think that's a
hard(er) error.
