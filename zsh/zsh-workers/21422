So what? Did you stop to think for a second, that if the default zsh
config didn't
suck, then the various distributions might use it?

And as an end user, who on occasion tries to evangelize zsh, I would prefer=
 if=20
developers spent a a small amount of time making zsh work well, by default,=
 most
of the time, for most people.

Me: Try zsh, it rocks.
Friend: Ok, I got zsh. This prompt sucks. How do I fix it?
Me: Go get a .zshrc from the net
Friend: Ok, completion doesn't complete .pdf's for acroread like you
said it would.
Me: Go spend hours tweaking your .zshrc.
Friend: Gah! Why don't they just include this by default?
Me: Beats me.
Friend: Screw this, I'm going back to bash. It's available on most
platforms anyway,
why go through the pain of copying around my .zshrc?

It is unclear to me why so many fight so hard to prevent good defaults from=
=20
making it into many products (especially in open source). Not everyone has =
the
time or motivation to customize and tweak zsh for hours; why not at least t=
ry to
make it work well out of the box?

Thanks,
Keir
