From: Peter Stephenson <pws@csr.com>

I'll be away next week in LA, where they may or may not have computers and
networks.  If the directory moves are finished, I'll produce 4.0.1-pre-3
when I get back.  I'll then be having a week or two's entirely necessary
holiday, so I don't expect 4.0.1 to be out before Easter.
