Greetings,

It seems that rsync completer in at least zsh 4.2.1 (from Debian
GNU/Linux testing) uses only _hosts and _users completers for
completing hosts and users.  WIBNI it used _ssh_hosts and
_ssh_users if RSYNC_RSH environment variable or -e or --rsh options
indicated that ssh is being used?  And similarly in the case of
rsh.
