} When using M-/ and M-, what happens is that:

} I hit M-,(M-/) a second time: it wraps around.

That sounds like exactly what's supposed to be happening:

stop
     If set to `true', the _history_complete_word bindable command will
     stop once when reaching the beginning or end of the history.
     Invoking _history_complete_word will then wrap around to the
     opposite end of the history.  If this style is set to `false' (the
     default), _history_complete_word will loop immediately as in a
     menu completion.

} Can I be messing this with some other variable or is this a bug?
} OR am I missing something obvious?? :)

I think it's the last of those.  What did you *expect* to happen?
