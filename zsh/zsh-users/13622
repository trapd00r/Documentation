The distribution I use has 4.3.4 and I'd rather not upgrade
the entire zsh "manually" if possible.  I do have some completion
stuff such as _git from the CVS version in my personal fpath.

I'm not quite sure what's the correct way to disable _correct
completer, but since the manual says the default is

zstyle ':completion:*' completer _complete _correct

I tried just "zstyle ':completion:*' completer _complete" but that
didn't seem to help.  Oh well, at least it's good to know that this
problem will go away when I finally get 4.3.9.

Thanks,
