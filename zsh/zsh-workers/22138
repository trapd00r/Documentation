Here's a patch to fix the first part of having non-convertable
characters found when completing filenames:  we now output the full
filename string instead of a truncated version of it.  I chose to just
call nicechar() to have it output a \M-x sequence (to make it the same
as the non-multibyte code).

However, I was wondering if it would be nicer to switch both the old and
the new code over to using a 3-digit octal value in such output?  E.g.
output "\303" instead of "\M-C", and "\201" instead of "\M-^A"?

..wayne..
