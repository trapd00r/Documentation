Hi,

I've defined some aliases like wget='noglob wget'. Running run-help
(ESC h) for these commands gives me the help for noglob. I've checked and
run-help is called with noglob, i.e. the expanded command and not the one
typed in by the user. I didn't found where run-help gets called to fix it
there. The other way would be to use getln to get the correct command
line and use this in run-help. Which one would you prefer?

Bye, Jörg.
