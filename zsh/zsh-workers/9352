I can't stop thinking about this...

The advantage of using a glob-pattern over using ignored-patterns is
the automatic fall back first on only directories and then all files
(or whatever you have configured).

Is this a valid reason to add a `glob-pattern' (or `file-pattern')
style that is tested in _files and used to replace a function-supplied 
pattern if there is any or to make _files use the pattern even if he
calling function did not use -g? Or is this a case of `if you want
that behaviour, copy and modify the completion function'?

Bye
 Sven
