That is what _match is for. I personally find unconditional _expand on
every TAB bad idea - you always have ^Xe (or ^XE) for that. 

zstyle ':completion:*' completer _oldlist _complete _match

_oldlist makes sure that you are using original expansions when
continuing completion (else second TAB may complete too much).
