Subject: setopt globcomplete and () broken

This is something that has been broken forever, but I never bothered
to look into exactly what broke it in my config. Today I got annoyed
enough though.

zsh -f
% autoload compinit; compinit
% mkdir newdir; cd newdir
% touch '()' '().'
% touch <tab>
% touch \(\)<tab>
\(\)   \(\).
% setopt globcomplete
% touch <tab>
% touch \(\)<tab>
# nothing appears

I can only reproduce it with a pair of parentheses, just ( or )
doesn't trigger it, but text can appear between them and still trigger
it. The oldest version I tried was 4.2.5 and the newest some days old
cvs.
