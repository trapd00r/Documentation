Not sure what you mean, if you compile the functions dir into
functions.zwc, that is used and the files in the functions dir are not
looked at. I've done this for years. It seems the files do need to
exist for the system to work, is that what you mean? I think only the
listing is used, strace reveals none of them are opened except
compaudit/init and a few more, but nothing while tabcompleting.
