I think the best idea is to use the anonymous CVS server from Tanaka-san
(do I have the order right here ?). That's what I'm doing...

Personally, I'm tracking latest zsh by cvs. And it can be accessed by
anonymous cvs.

Try `:pserver:anonymous@crane.jaist.ac.jp:/projects/zsh'.
The password is empty string and module name is `zsh'.

The main trunc should be latest zsh.
