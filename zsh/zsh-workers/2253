Oh, god!  I thought it was just us!  We just went through the same thing.  
But the whole division is going---500-700 people.    The first day was 
intellectually insulting "california 60's" psycho-babble and typical 
argle-barble "map/territory" confusion.  I walked out at noon.  The week 
before, there was a Dilbert about "Whoh! We can't just rush into the 
pre-meeting meeting without having a pre-pre-pre meeting to set it up!"   So,
 guess what we covered in the next 2 days!!!???
