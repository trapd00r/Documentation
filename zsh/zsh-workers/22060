Subject: Getting an autoconf error with -dev-2
To: zsh-workers@sunsite.dk
Message-id: <1051209164855.ZM28567@candle.brasslantern.com>

cd . && ./.preconfig
configure.ac:516: error: possibly undefined macro: AC_PROG_EGREP
./Util/preconfig: ./.preconfig failed (status 1)

Which version of autoconf are we assuming, now?  I have 2.53, which has
always been sufficient before.
