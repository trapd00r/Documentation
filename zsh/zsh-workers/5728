I'd like to ask anyone if we should really do things like this.
Personally I would prefer to let the user use the global match
specs for things like this as otherwise the behavor might be somewhat
unexpected.

Note, this is just a question, I'm not saying that we shouldn't do
it. With the global match specs I have, I get this behavior anyway and 
I even added something like that in `_long_options' to make Andrej
happy. Im just not sure...

Bye
 Sven
