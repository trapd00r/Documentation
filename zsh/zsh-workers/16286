I'm sorry to say that my previous fix, setting CYGWIN to "nobinmode" 
before invoking zsh, doesn't actually work.  My initial test was not a 
proper test at all.  It doesn't seem that setting or not setting CYGWIN 
makes any difference.  Also, I have the same problem with 'bash' as zsh, 
so I guess it's not a zsh problem at all.

I never had this problem before; maybe it's something new in emacs 21.1, 
or maybe I'm not building/installing cygwin properly.  Oh well, thanks 
for the help.
