} Yes, it was indeed using the path, which was wrong in this case.

I know I'm running a few days behind here, but ...

This patch:

} -	    subcols = putfilecol(&mcolors, g->name, path, buf->st_mode);
} +	    subcols = putfilecol(&mcolors, g->name, m->str, buf->st_mode);

makes "path" be an unused parameter of clprintm.  Should it be removed
entirely, or is there a case in which it ought to be getting used?
