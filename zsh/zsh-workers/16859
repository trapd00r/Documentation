So if I comprehend what's going on here correctly, this links the zsh/pcre
module against libpcre, but doesn't link the zsh binary against it?

This seems like a good thing.  Could it perhaps also be applied to the
termcap and terminfo modules?

If you were also to document in Etc/zsh-development-guide how one sets
this up for an arbitary module + libary, I'd say go ahead an commit it.
