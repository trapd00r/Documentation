As a result of a side conversation with <tgape@cyberramp.net>, and further
evidenced by absence of the problem from both 3.1.4 and my locally-patched
3.0.5, I believe that the bug is fixed by this patch from PWS:

	http://www.zsh.org/mla/workers-1998-hyper/0106.html

It has to do with the way a dummy character is sometimes inserted and then
deleted when performing a completion within a word.  I didn't immediately
make the connection because the patch refers to expand-or-complete-prefix.
