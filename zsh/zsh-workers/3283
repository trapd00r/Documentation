A few times lately, I've had need of a way to watch for a certain process to
exit. I think it'd be a nice addition to zsh. For example, suppose I want to
be notified when the process "foo" terminates.  I'd like to be able to do

% watch $(pidof foo)

and continue about my business, and later zsh would say something like

foo exited at 8:10AM.
%

Is this feasible? :)
