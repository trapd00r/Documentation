The fact they display doesn't tell you very much.  You also need to
check that once you've got them on the command line they behave like a
single character.  The easiest way is just to move the cursor and check
it doesn't go to far (which it will if doesn't recognise the two bytes
as a single character).

If that's really working, input processing is quite involved to check.
The key function for this is getrestchar() in Src/Zle/zle_main.c.  This
should recognise the first byte is an incomplete character and the
second byte completes it.  I don't think this an easy way to avoid
debugging the insides.

I think we've already gone through this by showing that the multibyte
option is on by default.
