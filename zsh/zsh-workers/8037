Subject: Problem with setting both listpacked&listrowsfirst? 
To: zsh-workers <zsh-workers@sunsite.auc.dk>
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

I think I've applied all the completion patches to  ZSH 3.1.6-pws-5.
(7959 7960 7974 7985 7998 8011 8021 8028)

When I do a "setopt listpacked listrowsfirst" and attempt completion with tab I
don't get a listing for ambiguous matches.
