Cool, thanks.  After totally messing up my last CVS repository, I can
finally see how well my latest tracking efforts have gone.

One small request which you should immediately ignore if you don't
have the time to do it: would it be possible to provide your pws-*
releases in patch form as well?  If you do have time, I'd be most
grateful as my usual connectivity is a 56k modem on a fairly bad line
:-(

Argh, everyone's leaving :-(  With you and Sven away, I doubt there's
much chance of the backlog getting too heavy...
