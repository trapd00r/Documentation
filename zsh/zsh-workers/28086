Confirmed with a pretty recent git build.

Host from ~/.ssh/config aren't proposed until hosts found from other 
methods are exhausted.  The biggest reason that seems wrong (IMO) is 
that 'other methods' includes ~/.ssh/known_hosts.  So, a host I've never 
ssh'ed to won't be offered until I've ssh'ed to it.

With 'acerwin.internal' and 'acerlin.internal' as hosts that show up 
already, I tested by adding, to an already large ~/.ssh/config:

Host acerjjjconfig

And editing ~/.ssh/known_hosts to add acerjjjkh as an alias of some 
other host.

Then acerlin, acerwin, and acerjjjkh are offered in the initial list, 
but acerjjjconfig isn't offered until I type the 'c' (which is also 
annoying because acerj<Tab> completes at that point unambiguously to 
acerjjjkh).

The two _combinations branches in _ssh_hosts that use the user-hosts tag 
seem to be returning intentionally if anything matches.  Removing the ' 
&& return' from each seems to make things better.  But, I'm not sure of 
the use-case that those are supporting.

Another thing to note is that I couldn't get it to recognize HostName 
when HostName was indented as David had it.  E.g. adding:

Host acerjjjconfig
	HostName acerjjjindented

only added acerjjjconfig to the list of completions.
