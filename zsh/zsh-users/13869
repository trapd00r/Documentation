I assume you're looking for histignorespace (hist_ignore_space if you're 
rooting through man pages)?  Then any command that starts with a space (or 
any alias that expands as such) is ignored.

The 'alias' thing is useful, for example, to hide some things I don't 
really care to have in history:

alias fg=' builtin fg'
alias bg=' builtin bg'
alias rehash=' builtin rehash'
