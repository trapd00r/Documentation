I would be happy to join you. Mandrake 9.1 defaulted to UTF-8 on update and
this was immediately visible with Zsh :)

Could you please give short description of your work? There are several
problems associated with mulitbyte locales and switching to UTF does not
magically solve all of them (strictly speaking it solves none without
further work).

Thank you very much for your effort.

P.S. Do you have handy any links for i18n in other shells (bash or any
other) or other text-processing programs? I had them once but lost as it
seems.
