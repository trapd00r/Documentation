Hi all,

most of you will be familiar with this construct:

-{h,-help}'[print help and exit]'

my question is how I can exclude any options. The normal
approach of

'(-v)-h[print help and exit]'

does not work, presumably because the -{h,-help} is outside of
the single ticks.

Also, is there a way to use wildcards in the exclusion part at
the beginning? Normal globbing characters are taken literally.


Thanks,
Richard
