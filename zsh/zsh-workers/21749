} I came to ask that myself.

Under the doc for the "read" builtin in 4.2.x and later:

    -s
          Don't echo back characters if reading from the terminal.
          Currently does not work with the -q option.

So, it should be possible to recognize a "[Pp]assword:" prompt and
call "read -s", perhaps even "read -se | zpty -w" so you don't
need to store the password in a variable even temporarily.
