It's already documented, fairly well down the manual page.

       Note also that the functions for the completion system assume
       that the KSH_AUTOLOAD option is not set.  They cannot be loaded
       if it is set.  To avoid having to unset KSH_AUTOLOAD, you can
       instead use one or more zwc file(s) that have been created with
       the command zcompile −z to load the functions for the completion
       system; see zshbuiltins(1).  This forces the functions to be
       autoloaded the way zsh normally loads func‐tions.

> (2) Should we change _comp_options to always include NO_kshautoload?

Seems sensible, in view of the above.
