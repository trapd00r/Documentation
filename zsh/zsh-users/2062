Subject: Changing glob qualifier?
Status: RO
X-Mailing-List: <zsh-users@sunsite.auc.dk> 2062


Hello

Zsh supports a (undocumented) glob modifier `o' which can be used to
test for exact file modes. There is a request to change it's behaviour 
and the character to use for it.

So the question is: does anyone make use of the `o' modifier so that
it should be kept, or can we go along and alter it?

Bye
 Sven
