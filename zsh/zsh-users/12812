Hi,

When creating a new executable script in my ~/bin directory, which is
contained in the $PATH variable, this file is not found by the tab
completion of the current shell. After starting a new shell, the file
is found.

I looks like, zsh buffers the contents of all directories in the PATH
upon startup and does not reread those dirs.

Is there any option to disable this buffering?

best, Peter
