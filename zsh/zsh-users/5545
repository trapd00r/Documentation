  My understanding of what exec does must be incomplete then.  I thought
the function of exec was to replace the current shell with a command, in
which case, the shell is already terminated before any actual execution
of the <command> happens.  Is this not how it works?  Or did you
specifically say "from a user's perspective" for a reason? :) If
that's the case, then I don't think the "correct" behaviour should be
changed (to suit users who disagree); the fix for that is to educate the
users.  In this case, the result of the education may be to use your
script, which does the job of providing the behaviour those users are
looking for very well.

  Agree.
