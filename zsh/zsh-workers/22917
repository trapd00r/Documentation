I've narrowed this down a little bit.  It only happens under zsh;
under bash, the recipe works without error.  Thinkging that for some
reason, stdin was being opened in a text mode, I tried setting
CYGWIN=binmode before starting zsh, but that had no effect on this
problem.

I believe the upgrade that broke this was the most recent
gettext/libintl upgrade.  In order to link against the most recent
libintl, I have rebuilt zsh from source (both from the cygwin source
tarball and also from the latest zsh sources in CVS), but still the
problem persists.

I would appreciate any help that can be offered.

Thanks,
  Vin
