I built only with ./configure, but I confess I did not check that the
build options enabled debugging, as they usually do with ./configure. I
re-tried with --enable-zsh-debug --enable-zsh-mem-debug
--enable-zsh-hash-debug. Here is the new backtrace:

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.

I do not know valgrind, so I am not sure which are the appropriate
options, but a raw "HOME=3D/tmp/empty valgrind ./Src/zsh" gives sime
interesting details:

Again, I can make a core file available if you need it. I guess the
final core would be rather useless, since according to valgrind, the
memory is probably already corrupted at this point, but I can use gdb to
produce a core at the entrance of save_params.
