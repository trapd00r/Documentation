It's not me who made this change.  This comes from Clive's texinfo
documentation.  ispell says that depreciate is correct.  I assume it has
the same meaning as deprecate.  I do not know enough about English to
decide which is better.

I'm still thinking about adding some or all of them to the baseline.  POSIX
requires export -p and readonly -p.  But I do not find any patches to
typeset.  Did I lost it or you'v never sent such a patch?
