Well, it depends how you regard the function syntax.

In the Bourne shell and its derivatives, defining a function
is really sticking foo() in front of a command. The "{" and "}"
are not part of the syntax of a function definition.

Note that POSIX has specified it with a restriction in that you
can only stick "foo()" in front of complex command, and bash is
the only shell to enforce that restriction.

bash allows:

foo() for i do echo "$i"; done
but not
foo() echo "$*"

contrary to all the other Bourne like shells which allow both.

Now, I agree that

$ /tmp/Z/bin/zsh -c 'f() { :; }; typeset -f'
f () {
        {
                :
        }
}

is not ideal ;). Looks like the fix is not as easy as that.
