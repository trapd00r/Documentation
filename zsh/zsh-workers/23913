Subject: Failing to write to history file if containing directory doesn't exist
MIME-Version: 1.0

Zsh currently fails to write a history file if the directory
containing it doesn't exist.  Would a patch that creates the parent
directory if it doesn't exist before attempting to write to the
history file be of any interest?  I'd be willing to write such a
patch, but if this behavior is undesirable, I won't waste my time.
