I don't have a 3.0.5, so I couldn't try the patch. But as far as I can 
see, this should behave like normal completion with `setopt AUTOLIST'
and `setopt LISTAMBIGUOUS'.

This is already in all current versions of 3.1.5.

(For Dag: the most recent version is available at
`http://www.ifh.de/~pws/computing/zsh-3.1.5-pws-6.tar.gz', but it's
*very* beta.)
