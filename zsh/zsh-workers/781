zsh v. 2.6-beta13 on HP-UX A.09.01
zsh v. 2.6-beta13 on SunOS 5.4

When I do:

  while echo crap >/dev/null; do done

and <CTRL>-C break out of it, most of the time (intermittent) my output
seems to stay redirected, and I have to fix it with

  exec >&2

(Note: a difference between HP-UX and Solaris is that, on HP-UX,
 I still manage to see my prompt, while on Solaris nothing but
 error comes out)
