While we're on the subject, `bindkey -l' and `bindkey -lL' aren't much use.
The current keymap is the one aliased to main (or is main linked to
it...?), but there's no indication of which that is, and the implication
that all keymaps were created with `bindkey -N new-keymap' is also wrong if
the keymap was created as a copy of another one.

I can't remember how long it is since I started using zsh, but I *still*
can't remember if doing `bindkey -v' then `bindkey -e' or vice versa
restores all the special bindings you had before.  The answer seems to be
yes.  Cool.
