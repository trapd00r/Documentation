Why doesn't "integer" accept the "-i N" option of "typeset"?  And if there's
a good reason why not, shouldn't the doc say that "integer" is equivalent to
"typeset -i10" and not "typeset -i"?

While I'm on the subject ...

integer [ {+|-}lrtux ] [ NAME[=VALUE] ... ]
     Equivalent to `typeset -i', except that options irrelevant to
     integers are not permitted.

Eh?  What relevance to integers do -l (lowercase) and -u (uppercase) have?
Surely those should be -L (left justify) and -R (right justify)?
