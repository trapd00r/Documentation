In each version of the shell, set up the same command line state and
then instead of TAB press control-x question-mark.  That will invoke
_complete_debug which will dump a trace of the commands executed by
the completion system into a file in /tmp.

You can then diff the two files to see what's (not?) happening in
4.3.5 to cause this.
