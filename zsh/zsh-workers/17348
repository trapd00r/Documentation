Thanks for the update.

I wonder if the issue I mentioned in 16853 is going to be a problem for
them then. We ought to come up with a quick fix for 4.0. I'm off on
holiday midway through next week and have a lot of work to finish before
so I can't do anything quick.

I'll be interested to see what these updates are. I'm guessing that
they've cut out a few modules and completion stuff.
