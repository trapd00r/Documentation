Subject: Allocation bug
Date: Sun, 26 Sep 1999 19:03:20 +0200
From: Peter Stephenson <pws@ibmth.df.unipi.it>

Talking of allocation, although this seems to be totally separate and to do
with completion: with autoselection,

% print $MA<TAB>
MACHTYPE     MAILDROP     MAILSERVER   mailpath     manpath                 
MAILCHECK    MAILPATH     MANPATH      mailpref     mapfile                 

where MACHTYPE is highlighted.  Using down arrow gives me the message
BUG: permanent allocation in prefork
