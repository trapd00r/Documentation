Completely replacing the output of a completion functions may be doable
though is likely to be icky, but note that if you define a function

  cyg() {
    reply=("$(cygpath -w $REPLY)")
  }

in a recent version of the shell then you can put "(+cyg)" (minus
quotes, with parentheses---it's a glob qualifer) after any file name to
convert it.
