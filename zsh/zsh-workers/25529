Okay - I stand corrected here. I meant it should support it in ksh
emulation. And in both *sh* and ksh emulation, it would be helpful to
ban that from use since neither support that zsh-specific function
definition form.

Supporting array initialization like ksh and bash do is incidental.
More important I think is reducing damaging behavior when making
simple (and perhaps likely) mistakes and/or giving a more likely
understandable error message.
