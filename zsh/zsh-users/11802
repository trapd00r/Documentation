I'd like to point out that $* is not the right way to pass
parameters around. $* strips the empty arguments.

You want "$@" (with quotes) as with the other shells.

Also, in zsh (contrary to ksh and bash), typeset is a builtin
parsed like any other builtin, so in the typeset command above,
the command substitution will be word spit, you want:

typeset -g fgjob="$(jobs "$@")"

Or better

typeset -g fgjob
fgjob=$(jobs "$@")

not sure the typeset -g is needed there.
