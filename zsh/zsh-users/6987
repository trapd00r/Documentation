It took me a while to find a 10.2 machine. I can confirm that it had no
dlcompat. Not sure about the original poster. I did specify the module
to be linked statically and I seem to remember that there were still
difficulties (there was also another condition expression failure). I
have not encountered problems with the same version of zsh on hosts
running 10.3 with fink (and dlcompat) also installed.
