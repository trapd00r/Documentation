if you really want to use that feature for the directory 'source' and
don't use the 'source' builtin ever, you could probably put:
disable source

in your .zshrc

aura% disable source                                   
aura% type source
source not found
aura% mkdir source
aura% source
aura% pwd
/home/william/source
aura% enable source
aura% type source
source is a shell builtin

if you really wanted to get fancy, you could probably write a small
function to call the builtin source but only if an argument is given.
