hi,

this little script shows a (for me) strange behavior.
,----
| #!/bin/zsh
| #  test.zsh
|
| mp=3D$$
|
| echo "pid=3D$mp"
| ps aux | grep " $mp "
| echo "----"
| ps aux | grep "start.osd" | grep -v "grep" | grep -v " $mp "
`----

calling the script often in series, i sometimes got this:
,----

- first call:
   why is the process id from the second ps [c] other than the process
   id from the first ps [b] and $$ [a] ?

- second call:
   and what is "[test.zsh]" [2] and why has it got another pid (4216)
   than $$ (4173) [1] ?

am i doing something wrong or is this a bug?

thanx for your help,
rico
