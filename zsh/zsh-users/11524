Subject: tab completion list does not complete dot files
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1; format=flowed
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

i am not a subscriber, and hope this is ok to ask here.  seems to be.

please copy me on any replies.

when i use tab completion on a directory with dot files, the dot files
are ignored in the completion list.  "/tmp/\t" will not list
/tmp/.foo.

in the man pages i have not found a way to make zsh list the dot files
in the completion list when i press tab.  (my preferred behavior for *
expansion in both shells, otoh, is to *not* expand dots.  i have
solved that one already.)

possible?

thanks.
