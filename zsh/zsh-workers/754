Hi, I just upgraded to the most recent beta version (13 or so?) from 
beta1 (mostly so I could use the auto-param-slash setopt).

Only problem is that when I do any 'man' command that is longer than my 
screen, it quits at the bottom of the screen.

I seem to have one additional detail although I don't know how it helps:  
my .zshenv sources additional files during startup (one for bindkeys, one 
for aliases, etc etc) this has always worked fine.  However, if I DO NOT 
have .zshenv source my functions on startup, then the 'man' problem 
doesn't happen.  I can even source the functions by hand after the shell 
has begun and it will still be OK, but if I source it on startup the 
problem always occurs.

Any clues?

Thanks
TjL
