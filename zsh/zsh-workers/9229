I suggest, that functions are being installed in version-specific directories as
well. Unfortunately (and that applies to the development builds in the first
place) it is often impossible to mix binaries and functions from different
versions. Just think about added computil module :-) Currently it is hard to
revert back to previous version (better said, I often want to keep several
versions to test the difference. As it stands now, you cannot simply run old
binary because functions are already changed).
