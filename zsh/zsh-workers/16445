I'm having problems with outgoing e-mail so sorry if this turns up
twice, in two weeks time, to Sven only or whatever.

I mentioned before (14031, last two paragraphs) that using _message in
these cases also has the problem that the format style for the
descriptions tag is not looked up.

There needs to be a way to add a type of match with description but
without actually adding matches that can be used in those cases where
adding matches isn't sensible. The interface to it can perhaps be
_guard like for the pattern.
