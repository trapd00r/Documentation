Yeah I did but there was so much there, I gave up before
detecting this.

Also added:
alias exit='echo -e I wont go away'

So there we go... hopefully I can now press F4 and always
get a shell - weirdly I also added a 10 minute cron to
kill anything that uses the shell viz.

10,20,30,40,0 * * * * kill `ps ax|grep 'pts/4'|grep -v zsh|cut -d'p' -f1` 2>/dev/null

(I am a screen(1) user).
