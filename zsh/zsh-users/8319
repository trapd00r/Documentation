Hi! I've just moved from bash to zsh (I got tired of bash's poor command 
completion) and this shell is awesome!  

I have one problem though, I didn't find the way to remove a specific entry 
from the history ( in bash I can easily do this with the command 'history -d 
<item_nr>').

Anybody know how to do this?

Toshiro.
