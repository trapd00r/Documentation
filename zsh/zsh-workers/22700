Um, man1/zshall.1, is just a wrapper that contains a whole lot of .so
commands to read in the other sections.  So unless /tmp/zshall.1 is
the output of "man zshall" or is a copy of e.g. cat1/zshall.1, you're
not going to find anything interesting.

Try "grep -i uid zshparam.1" for example.  The older the part of the
zsh manual you're looking at (and the EUID parameter is *really* old)
the more likely it is to have been written for the benefit of non-
programmer college freshmen, not people who would have any idea what
"setuid" means or even what a system call is ... and I don't think it's
reasonable to expect that the manual for an interactive shell would
contain a reference to a specific system call in any case.
