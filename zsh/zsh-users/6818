Yes, I know.

The first patch fails to detect if configure runs without a
controlling tty, does not run the test and assumes that tcsetpgrp()
works correctly.

The second patch aborts the configure run in that case.

The first patch was a work in progress, the second patch is supposed
to be an improvement :-)

Why do you want to run configure with nohup?

I guess I could run the test in a separate, created pty, but that is
going to be messy to do portably in configure.

Phil.
