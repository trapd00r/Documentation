Here's a zle widget called insert-args-of which does the whole thing.
Type `cmd1' and execute the widget.  Actually, !? searches for a string
inside the command, so it's more powerful than I suggested.  What you
asked for works without the `?'s.

Works without `banghist' in use, since turning that on locally seems to
be sufficient.


#start
# Zle widget to look at a string and replace it with the arguments
# of the last command in the history containing that string.

emulate -L zsh
setopt banghist

# Remember position
integer pos=$CURSOR

# Find start of word.  Just use whitespace.
while [[ $CURSOR -gt 1 && $LBUFFER[-1] != [[:space:]] ]]; do
  (( CURSOR-- ))
done

# Insert history substitution characters
LBUFFER+="!?"

# Go back to start position, remembering extra characters.
(( CURSOR = pos + 2 ))

# Search for end of word.
while [[ -n $RBUFFER && $RBUFFER[1] != [[:space:]] ]]; do
  (( CURSOR++ ))
done

# Insert trailing history substitution characters.
LBUFFER+="?:*"

# Use magic-space to expand the history substitution.
zle magic-space
#end
