I can get this now.  From zsh -f, any recent version, in an empty
directory:

files=(AIWebKitMessageViewController.m
AIWebKitMessageViewPlugin.m
AIWebkitMessageViewStyle.m)
touch $files
chmod +x *.m
compctl -M '' 'm:{a-zA-Z}={A-Za-z}'
./AIWebKitMessagep

then TAB will cause it to happen.  I think the compctl -M is the key:
it's somewhere in the hairy matcher code.
