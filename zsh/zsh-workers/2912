Hi,
I am building zsh-3.1.1 beta, and get the following errors 
(see below) - I suppose that the build is not handling the fact
that yodl is not available for it to use on my system is a bug.

BTW I would like to know what this package is and where to get it
from? Is it worth using?

Thanks in advance,
Roy.

(ps I did send a spurious message to this list, I cut and pasted the
 wrong thing - I am sorry...)
