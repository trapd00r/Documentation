Much more interesting is this line:

> trace _mailboxes:41()> _wanted files expl mailbox specification

It shows that you are *not* using the _mailboxes file from dev-1, that 
doesn't call _wanted. And, as I said in an earlier mail, we had some
problems with _wanted (and very similar output) in earlier versions.

Maybe you have the old versions somewhere in your $fpath where they
are found before the current ones?

Bye
 Sven
