| Subject: Slightly changed copyright, new test release
| I've just made a new test release.  I hope that no changes will be
| necessary for zsh-3.0.1.  This is not a final release because the copyright
| notice is changed a bit and we need Paul's agreement for that.  The
| 3.0.1-test4 release can be downloaded as a patch for 3.0.0 from
| ftp://ftp.cs.elte.hu/pub/zsh/testing/zsh-3.0.1-test4.diff.gz
| 
| The new copyright notice which appears on the top of each file is
| 
[...]
| The texinfo documentation not contains the following conditions for
| copying:
[...]

mayor, town council, or tax collector.  Nobody is running for anything.
Look for an economic miracle in Green Lane, Pa.
