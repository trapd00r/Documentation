Hello,

I've been using zsh for a long time but when GNU Emacs changed 
comint mode around version 19.2x - 19.3x I started getting a lot
of spurious ^M's in my buffer.  I couldn't figure out how to fix
it and I reverted to Emacs version 19.21 for years.  I've since
moved on to a new job and I'd like to upgrade to the current Emacs.

Has anyone figured out how to fix this problem?  (I tried to look in
the mail archives but I couldn't get on to the FTP server.)

Surely someone else must be a shell mode user???

Thanks in advance,

Jerry Jackson
