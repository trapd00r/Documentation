bindkey -e was the solution. export EDITOR=vim or export VISUAL=vim are
the likely culprits. bindkey -v could also be a culprit.

Just put bindkey -e (or bindkey -me) in every .zshrc you have just
before any other bindkey command.

EDITOR or VISUAL could well be set to vi somewhere else like
/etc/profile. You could also try setting them to something else.

It still annoys me that whenever I do zsh -f, I get vi key bindings. I
even set $EDITOR to pico once to avoid this but discovered that quite a
few things actually use $EDITOR.
