Subject: tee-like file redirection in shell?

	is there currently some way to reproduce the effect of
the tee command in the shell itself, and if not, what do people
think of the idea of adding that ability (either by new file
redirectors or by making tee a builtin)?  a couple of times
recently, i've been caused many problems by the fact that tee
is a standalone program, and as such doesn't care about the
value of options like clobber; since tee _is_ basically just
another form of file redirection, it would be nice to have it's
behaviour be consistent with the other forms provided by the
shell.
