I think it's OK.

I'm not convinced about that.  I think it's just a tidying up operation
performed on the value.

That's a bug, probably, although it might need care fixing (does the
flag apply if the array is about to be joined?)

Yes, but I think the correspondence can sometimes be made more logical.
It doesn't make sense to have dirstack an integer, but it does makes
sense to have it contain unique elements.
