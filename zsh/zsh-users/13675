Yes, that's the reason. (Though "weird effects" is limited to not having 
the new group's privileges.)

Yes, three ways that have been discussed in this thread, two suggested by 
me...

1. (I said) Restarting nscd sometimes helps (though it doesn't seem to 
now)

2. (I said) alias Z=' exec sudo su - bhaskell'
I used to do this often enough that I had an alias for it... and I didn't 
know about:

3. (I didn't know about) newgrp/sg - the commands designed for setting 
your group
