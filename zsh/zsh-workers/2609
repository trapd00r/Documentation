The beta status is mentioned at the very beginning of the README and in the
announcement.  The 3.1.0 version number has several advantages:

1. it is easier to parse from a script
2. it is now identical to the RCS branch revision number
3. it is compatible with the Linux version numbering :-)

I can rename the tar.gz distribution to something like
zsh-3.1.1-beta.tar.gz and leave the ZSH_VERSION variable as 3.1.1.

Yes, unfortunately :-((.  I know several Unix sysadmins who do not know
even the very basics of Unix.  But these sysadmins rarely try to install
zsh.  And even if they install, zsh-3.1.0 should be quite stable without
--enable-dynamic (it's not the default for exactly this reason).
