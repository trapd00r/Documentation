I did: No, there isn't. I.e. actually there is an *object class*  
for that purpose, but obviously zsh doesn't make use of *that*.

But zsh is the *only* program with this problem on NEXTSTEP; so it  
can't be as simple as "zsh is right, but NEXTSTEP is wrong"... :-(  
perl, for instance, works perfectly well.

zsh 2.51 *can* deal perfectly with lower case Umlauts, as I said before.

Does this locale system consist of only the file /usr/lib/locale  
(so that I simply could install such a file), or is there a  
corresponding program that's necessary?

Maybe it's not necessary to really pass thru *all* characters; I  
can't judge, though.

Anyway, what do I have to do to make this option being implemented  
in future versions of zsh?
