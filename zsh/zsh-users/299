Note that if you're using an xterm, you can use the handy escape
sequences to put things like the PWD into window title and/or icon name
of the xterm:

<ESC>]n;text<^G>

where ESC and ^G are the appropriate ascii codes, and n is 2,1, or 0, to
put text in the window title, icon name, or both respectively.  I use:

if tty -s && [[ "$TERM" = "xterm" ]]; then
    chpwd () {
        echo -n "<ESC>]2;$PWD<^G>"
    }
fi

in my .zshrc to set the title bar of the xterm to my current directory.
