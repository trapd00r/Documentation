Oh, well, that's my weekend done for.

I looked at the discussion we had earlier about typeset -x in functions
(accidentally, by going to the top of the folder and starting to reply to
things 3000 messages ago... just as well I realised) and frankly it doesn't
increase my enthusiasm for doing anything about it.  It's all due to the
confusion of `typeset' and `local' in ksh.  With the documented fact that
`export' is equivalent to `typeset -gx', zsh is even now the only shell to
handle this in a consistent way.
