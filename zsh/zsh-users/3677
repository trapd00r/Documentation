Subject: `make' completion in zsh-3.1.9
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

It's driving me nuts :)

I have

	bindkey '^I' menu-expand-or-complete

and when I type

/usr/src/linux> make menu<tab>

the shell locks up for about ten seconds, recurring into every
directory of the kernel tree doing *something*.  Finally,
it comes back with `make menuconfig'.

zsh-3.1.6 didn't do this - `make' completions returned
immediately.

Any suggestions?

Thanks.
