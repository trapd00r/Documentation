<P>After you install your VT420, you must set some of the terminal's
operating features to</P>
<UL>
<LI>Select the correct dialect for your keyboard.</LI>
<LI>Run one or two sessions with one or two cables.</LI>
</UL>
<P>This chapter provides step-by-step instructions. All other VT420
operating features are already set to a factory-default setting that works
with most Digital systems.</P>
<P>You may have to set some features to match your host system. For
example, the VT420 must use the same communication baud rate as your
host system.</P>
<P>Also, the terminal ID must match the software running on the host. If
the message <TT>unknown terminal type</TT> appears on the screen, you must set
the correct terminal ID. This chapter provides the instructions to</P>
<UL>
<LI>Set the baud rate.</LI>
<LI>Set the correct terminal ID.</LI>
</UL>
<P>The VT420 has a series of set-up screens that list the terminal's operating
features. You can examine and change feature settings from the keyboard.
The procedures in this chapter explain how to use some set-up screens. If
you want to know more about set-up, or if you want to set a feature not
covered here, see <A HREF="chapter5.html">Chapter 5</A>.</P>
<H2 ID="S3.1">Selecting the Correct Keyboard Dialect</H2>
<P>The VT420 has keyboard models for a number of dialects. The initial
setting for the <STRONG>keyboard dialect</STRONG> feature is <TT>North American Keyboard</TT>.</P>
<P>If you have the North American/United Kingdom keyboard, you can skip
this procedure, unless you want to use the British dialect. If you have
any other keyboard model, you must complete this procedure to select the
correct keyboard dialect.</P>

dialect for the second session, first set-up the VT420 for two sessions (next
section). Then press the <SPAN CLASS="keyname">F4</SPAN> (Session) key and repeat the procedure above.</P>
<H2 ID="S3.2">Setting Up the VT420 for One or Two Sessions</H2>
<P>The VT420 has two communication (Comm) ports that let you run one or
two sessions -- the Comm1 port and the Comm2 port. These ports provide
the cable connections to your host system(s). To set up the terminal
correctly, you must know</P>
<UL>
<LI>How many sessions you want to run -- one or two.</LI>
<LI>Which port(s) you are using: Comm1, Comm2, or both.</LI>
<LI>What type of cable(s) you are using: RS-232 or DEC-423.</LI>
</UL>
<P>If you are unsure, see the "<A HREF="chapter2.html#S2.3">Cable Connections</A>" section in <A HREF="chapter2.html">Chapter 2</A>. After
you identify the port(s) and cables in use, go to the section that matches
your installation.</P>
<UL>
<LI>One session (one cable).</LI>
<LI>Two sessions (two cables).</LI>
<LI>Two sessions with SSU software (one cable).</LI>
</UL>
<P>Remember, the terminal must use a separate cable for each session,
unless your system has SSU software or a DECserver 200 or DECserver
300 terminal server. SSU lets you run two sessions over one cable, and
these terminal servers have SSU software.</P>
<P>The primary Comm1 port has two connectors -- a 25-pin, RS-232 connector
and a 6-pin DEC-423 connector. The secondary Comm2 port has a 6-pin,
DEC-423 connector. You can also use the Comm2 port to connect a local
printer to the VT420.</P>
<H3 ID="S3.2.1">Setting Up for One Session (One Cable)</H3>
<P>You only need one communication cable to run one session. You can
connect the cable to either of the connectors on the primary Comm1
port -- 25-pin RS-232 or 6-pin DEC-423. After you connect your cable, you
must check the settings on the Global Set-Up screen.</P>
