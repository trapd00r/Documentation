What do people use for browsing Zsh documentation?

As mentioned in a previous thread, Zsh terminology and my brain are 
still not operating on the same wavelength, so I have a hard time 
navigating to what I need in the man pages (usually 'zshall', since I 
can't narrow down my inquiry properly).

Is that what everyone here uses ('man')?  Or is the searchability and/or 
cross-referencing better with some other utility?
