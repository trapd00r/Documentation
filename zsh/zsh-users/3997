Maybe what is bothering him is that if you do

     /u_local/
       ^--- cursor (no space)
and press TAB, nothing is completed. If you enter a slash, however, it works:

    /u/_local/          (or /u_/local/)
is completed to
    /usr/local/

But if you don't type in that extra slash explicitly, completeinword doesn't
seem to be doing what he wants.
