OK.  Now I see a little more of what's going on.  It turns out that
when 'make check' fails, I have been specifying CC on the command
line: CC=/usr/local/egcs-2000-06-30/bin/gcc mk-zsh.
(mk-zsh runs 'Util/preconfig', then 'configure', then 'make' and then
'make check'.)  When I don't override CC, 'make check' works fine.
Sorry for the previous red herring; the failures have nothing to do
with srcdir != objdir.

When I get the chance, I will investigate further.
