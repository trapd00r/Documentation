Zsh in current Mandrake (4.2.4) crashes when completing rsync. I can currently 
reproduce it by using the following (_rsync is from current CVS):

{pts/3}% zsh -f
localhost% autoload -U compinit; compinit
localhost% bindkey '^I' complete-word
localhost% zmodload zsh/complist
localhost% bindkey -M menuselect / accept-and-infer-next-history
localhost% setopt nolistambiguous
localhost% zstyle ':completion:*' menu select=0
localhost% zstyle ':completion:*:rsync:*' hosts ftp.uio.no ftp.sunet.se

Now start completion by using e.g.

rsync rsync://ftp.ioTAB

and continue pressing "/" (you need to select some from list) until you get to 
rsync://ftp.uio.no/fedora-linux-core/updates/1/i386 and display list of 
files.

Pressing cursor UP at this point crashes zsh.
