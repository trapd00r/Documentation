Hi.

Here is the issue.

  hugo@buena ~> rsync foobar:/tmp/a<tab>
  /tmp/a b               /tmp/aaaaaaa
  /tmp/aaa/

With another <tab>:

  hugo@buena ~> rsync foobar:/tmp/a\ b

Finally, running the command:

  hugo@buena ~> rsync foobar:/tmp/a\ b .

I get:

  hugo@buena ~> rsync foobar:/tmp/a\ b .
  receiving file list ...
  link_stat "/tmp/a" failed: No such file or directory
  link_stat "/home/hugo/b" failed: No such file or directory
  0 files to consider
  client: nothing to do: perhaps you need to specify some filenames or the --recursive option?
  rsync error: some files could not be transferred (code 23) at main.c(653)

Backslashes should be "triple-escaped" like the scp completion does.

Regards,

Hugo
