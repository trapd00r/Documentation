obviously the shell can already parse something like this:

 	foo || bar && baz | grep abc\|xyz

so, without reinventing the wheel, what's a good way to determine which of 
those commands returned a non-zero exit status to the shell? what if i 
have a more complicated sublist? or a list?

the grep example above shows a shortcoming of splitting on the pipe, and 
that doesn't even begin to deal with conditional expressions or lists.

any thought?
