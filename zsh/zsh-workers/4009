Given:

	compctl -C -aBF + -K foo

(it doesn't matter what function foo does), aliases/builtins/functions are
NOT completed in the command position; the reply from `foo' is always used.

If instead the order is reversed:

	compctl -C -K foo + -aBF

then completion of aliases/builtins/functions proceeds correctly whenever
`foo' produces an empty reply.

This is zsh 3.0.5; I haven't tried 3.1.2.
