I think what you *really* want is a way of re-expanding the current
prompt.  Then everything could be done in a zle widget without any
strange display tricks.  At the moment the code assumes the prompt won't
change during editing, so that would need a bit of an internal rewrite.
However, I think it's a useful goal.
