A "parameter" is a variable in "zshspeak"? And typeset declares the
type of the variable because Bourne shells "think" everything is a
string? ("Unlike many other programming languages, Bash does not
segregate its variables by "type". Essentially, Bash variables are
character strings" -- Advanced bash scripting Guide)

Where is that documented?

Again: I couldn't find anything about than in the manpage (man
zshbuiltins for "printf"). What does ":-" do? Substring selection.
String formatting?

Plain magic to me.
