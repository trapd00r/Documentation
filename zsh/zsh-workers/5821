Hi,

I tried to configure zsh version 3.1.5 but it doesn't seem to apply seds on
@@version.mk@@, @@defs.mk@@, etc... in the Makefiles (@@.....@@ are left
unchanged in Makefiles). I'm running that on QNX/OS. I didn't have any
problems with zsh-3.0.5.  Is there a more recent release I can check with or
is this a known problem?

Thanks,

Philippe
