See the description of the auto_name_dirs option in the manual

AUTO_NAME_DIRS
     Any parameter that is set to the absolute name of a directory
     immediately becomes a name for that directory, that will be used
     by the `%~' and related prompt sequences, and will be available
     when completion is performed on a word starting with `~'.
     (Otherwise, the parameter must be used in the form `~PARAM' first.)

Cheers,
Stephane
