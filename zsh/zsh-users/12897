May I suggest changing the error message to be more verbose?
Verbose errors are good :)


Thanks,
Richard

PS: If you guys want, I can create patches for those 'please
provide a more verbose error message' suggestions. I just
think it is less work for both sides if I don't. If you prefer patches
please let me know & I will be happy to comply.
