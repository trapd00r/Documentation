I use to have a daily use of the amol's port of zsh then tcsh on
windows. GNU tools were provided by 

http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/

I gave up because gnuwin32 tools was damn slow. cygwin's zsh and tools
were astonishing faster didn't provide a nice enougth integration to
windows (cygpath is borring too borring for daily use!).

I played with monad (became powershell) which provides a much superior
scripting language but comes with no decent edition system.

I didn't use windows for years now but i'm curious and plan to try
reactos if i would have spare time so my question is: how do you plan to
use zsh? which what tools ? would your port provides vi keybindings ? 

regards
