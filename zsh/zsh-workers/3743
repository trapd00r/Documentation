There were many patches on that issue, with several conflicting branches.
zefram3 contained the set of patches that there was eventually a consensus
on (at least, a consensus among those few of us that were actually paying
close attention).  zefram3 fixed the original problem in all cases I
tested (only on Linux, but I don't think this is system dependent).
What precisely is not working for you?
