Hm. This seems to suggest that there is some trouble with unsetting
the special completion parameters. $words, I guess. We already fixed
some problems with it some time ago, but that was before 3.1.9.

I'll try to stare some more at the code, but can't promise anything.

Do you have any remembrance of what you tried to complete when it crashed?

Bye
 Sven
