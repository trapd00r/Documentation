No. You wouldn't want it to search the whole $fpath for every function 
it has already found.

It does, however look at the definition file when it (automatically,
i.e. without it being in $fpath) finds a zwc file for one of the
directories in $fpath. So, if you have `.../Core' in $fpath and there
is a file `.../Core.zwc', it will automatically search that for
functions. If it finds it there, but the file `.../Core/foo' is
younger, it uses that.

One of the reasons for `zrecompile -p':

  zrecompile -p -- .../std.zwc $^orig_fpath/*~*~(.)

or whatever...
