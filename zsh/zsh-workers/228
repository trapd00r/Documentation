On a lot of keyboards, ~ and + are adjacent -- or at least close -- and
both shifted.  I find it only a little harder to type than =.

I'm not sure what you mean here by "absolute" and "relative" stack
entries.  My intention is that ~+n do exactly what =n currently does,
and that ~-1 do what =- currently does, with the extensions that ~-n
can be used and that those who prefer to number the stack the other way
can use their preferred notation.
