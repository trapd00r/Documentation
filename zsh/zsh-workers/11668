Subject: Nasty problem with cursor placement after declining a listing
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

This is 3.1.7, hot off sourceforge CVS:

zagzig% bindkey -e;autoload -U compinit; compinit -D
zagzig% which <TAB>
zsh: do you wish to see all 2091 possibilities (1046 lines)? n
zagzig% which <TAB>
zagzig% which \!
                
                ^ cursor is now down here on the blank line below the prompt

This doesn't happen when the complist module is loaded.
