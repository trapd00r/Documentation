Hm, actually, my examples were a bit flawed.  It should have been:

case something in
  (*ome*)
    ...
  ;;
esac

But it seems that that kind of indenting is oncommon.  Argh, so many
choices, so little to gain.

Actually, I found quite a few cases where "(bar)" wasn't indented from
the "case", so that's why I asked.
