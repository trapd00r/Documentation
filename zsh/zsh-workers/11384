_expand_word (^xe) is also behaving weirdly with select-menu when there is
more than a page to display; it seems to flash up the completion list but
do nothing else.  _expand_word_list (^xd) works fine.  It also seems to be
tying itself (or rather the display) in knots trying to display the string
for all expansions, which, not surprisingly, is rather long in this case.

(I don't know if you've seen my display tied up in knots, but it's
topologically rather spectacular.)
