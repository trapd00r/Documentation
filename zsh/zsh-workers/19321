    OK, don't worry because this is not urgent, at least I have the
old mechanism working on Linux (on any Linux, I suppose). This
definitely can wait.

    I haven't build 4.0.8 yet, so I cannot tell if it builds, but
certainly this problem didn't prevent it from building in the past,
so no reason for failing exist now, neither.

    I'm not able to write the autoconf recipes, sorry, and I'm not an
ptmx expert O:), but if I can lend a hand, just tell me.

    Happy holidays :)
