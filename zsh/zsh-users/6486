Hi,

One of the alternatives for completing the kill command is a list of
pids generated by the _pids function.

_pids calls the command 'ps' which just returns the child processes of
the shell.

I'd actually prefer to return all processes owened by the current user=20
(ps -u $LOGNAME on linux) and i get the impression there's a way to
configure the completion system to use a custom command for the ps call
or a custom set of arguments. However i can't figure out how to do this.

This question was asked in the list a few years ago, but no solution
using the new syntax.

Am i right in thinking this is posible?  Or do i need to copy the entire
_pids function and hack it?

Any help would be much appreciated.

Regards

Sagar
