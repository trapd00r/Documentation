    Hi Oliver :))

    Not exactly. I've replaced a message like 'zsh: no matches found:
/**/*whatever*...' by a simple 'Sorry I didn't found whatever'. This
*is* intended, because I was writing a locate emulation for end users
(just for fun, I must admit, but for end users...). I didn't had in
mind using this function in pipelines or complex commands.

    You are completely right.

    I can think of one right now: if you use it in a command
substitution, you really don't want your file list, for example,
being 'grep: arse! cannot find your effin regex'... Yes, obviously
the less I could do with the function above is redirecting the
message to stderr, my mistake O:))

    Anyway I don't use 'locate' in pipelines or command substitution,
so I didn't think about this situation. Thanks for pointing.

    Yes, this would be a good idea, thanks a lot :)) And I must admit
- painfully ;)) - that it would be even better than a message.
