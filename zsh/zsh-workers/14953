Looks good, as far as I can see.

I've just committed the zhandler() patch to 4.0, but not the patch for
zcompile because that's a user-visible change and people might still
want to complain about the 0444 creation mode.

Also, there's still the job problem on Irix (14861, 14865, 14911) to
which we got no reply.


Bye
