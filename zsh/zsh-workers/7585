} Or we could add a flag that says that the string is to be split into
} different words and change `dquote_parse()' to allow us to say that
} the `endchar' is any white-space (or any seperator character).

I don't think that will work ... you have to split the string into words
long before you get into paramsubst() or you can't be guaranteed to get
it right.  It has to be a top-level syntax thing, not a parameter flag.

But maybe "a flag" isn't really what you meant ...

} I would have suggested using the forms with a double character (as in
} `${(A)arr:==a b c}') if that weren't too incompatible.

That means to assign the full path of the command named "a b c" to the
array.  You can't get away with overloading `=' any more than it already
is, I'm afraid.
