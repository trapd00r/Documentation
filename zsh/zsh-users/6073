I'm using zsh 4.1.0-dev-5.

Within a zsh script, is there any way that I can get the name of the
temporary file generated by the =(...) construct?

One of these is left sitting around in /tmp after each termination of
one of my zsh scripts, and I'd like to remove it.  If the script could
retrieve that file name, I could make sure to remove it before the
script exits.

Thanks in advance.
