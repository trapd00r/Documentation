The wording is different in >= 4.0.9, but "Subscript Flags" is still the
reference.  The entire thread is available at

Subject: Bug#236748: zsh: associative array documentation reference broken

Package: zsh
Version: 4.0.8-1
Severity: minor

The zshparam man page says:

 For associative arrays, `[*]' or `[@]' evaluate to all the values
 (not the keys, but see Subscript Flags below), in no particular
 order.

There is nothing relevant to this syntax under Subscript Flags. My
guess is that something was moved from Subscript Flags in this page to
Parameter Expansion Flags in zshexpn. Also, it would be helpful if the
reference told the reader where to look in the referred-to section,
rather than making him read all of the entries.

The above sentence should probably read:

 For associative arrays, `[*]' or `[@]' evaluate to all the values
 (not the keys, but see the documentation for the 'k' flag under
 Parameter Expansion Flags in zshexpn(1)), in no particular order.

Thanks.
