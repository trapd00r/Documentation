hi there,

i've come over a bug in the tar completion: it doesn't recognize the -C
switch. so if you type

    % tar xzf foo.tar.gz -C <TAB>

it lists the contents of the archive instead of the dirs in your current
directory. I've had a look at the completion function, but it's a bit
over my head atm.
