} is there a way to do it with zsh ?

Yes, if you're using compsys with the emacs-style bindings, which it
sounds as if you are, try typing Escape followed by either a comma or
a slash.

Look for _history_complete_word in "man zshcompsys".

(If you're using vi bindings you'll probably have to set up your own 
bindkey for this.)
