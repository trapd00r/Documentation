I think that the manual should say that, because it seems that the
provided AT&T ksh is generally ksh93 (e.g. under Debian and Mac OS X).

No, Geoff Clare said in the austin-group is:

$ ls a[b/*
a[b/file

in both cases. This is also what I obtain with AT&T ksh93 under Mac OS X.
So, only zsh, when run as ksh, is different. Is this a bug in zsh or does
ksh88 behave like that? (I don't have ksh88, so I can't test.)

Yes, this is strange and ksh93 under Mac OS X behaves differently, so
I assume that this is a bug in Debian's ksh package.

No:

vin:~> ll a\[b
-rw-r--r-- 1 vlefevre vlefevre 0 2007-10-09 16:10:36 *
-rw-r--r-- 1 vlefevre vlefevre 0 2007-10-09 16:25:17 *[
-rw-r--r-- 1 vlefevre vlefevre 0 2007-10-09 16:04:18 file
vin:~> bash -c 'ls a[b/*'
a[b/*  a[b/*[  a[b/file

and with ksh from Mac OS X (sh (AT&T Labs Research) 1993-12-28 p),
I get the same behavior, while zsh gives:

vin:~> ksh -c 'ls a[b/*'
a[b/*
