AFAIK, zsh never adds stuff to the path by itself with a trailing path -
so just stopping to do that yourself in your own config files, should
do the trick.

If this doesn't help you, you'll just have to write your own function
that normalises the paths - stripping the trailing slashes should be
easy enough - typeset wont do that for you.
