Thanks for looking further.  The shell doesn't currently attempt to
sanitize the symbols against shared libraries (when writing code you
sometimes only find there's a problem when a module load fails and
crashes the shell).  So adding the option is probably the right thing to do.
I'm not sure how to test; probably adding it for Tru64 alone would be OK.
It's not clear from config.guess what $host value configure sets, however.
I might get a chance to check tomorrow night.
