I'm pretty sure it's not the right behavior with @.

} to be either missing from the documentation or very well hidden.

Look closely:

}          _alternative \
}  	    'files:: _files' \
} -	    'hosts:: _rlogin_all_hosts -qS:' \
} -	    'users:: _rlogin_users -qS@' && ret=0
} +	    'hosts:: _rlogin_all_hosts -S:' \
} +	    'users:: _rlogin_users -S@' && ret=0

The -q and -S flags are inside quotation marks; they're not flags to
_alternative, they're flags to _rlogin_all_hosts and _rlogin_users,
which eventually pass them to _combination which passes them to compadd.
This is documented in info, but the comment at the top of _combination
is wildly out of date, particularly with respect to what it says about
how _telnet calls _combination.
