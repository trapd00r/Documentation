The zsh completion function for subversion currently parses the output
of svn help <subcommand>, attempting to complete based on the contents
of the usage: and Valid options: sections.

How does the subversion team feel about providing this and additional
information in a more-machine-parseable format?  I imagine that that
would lead to the bash completion becoming more intelligent as well.
