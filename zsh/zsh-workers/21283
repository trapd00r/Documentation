Zsh does not provide an ERR trap because some platforms on which zsh can be
compiled actually have SIGERR defined, which is a real OS-level signal and
not interchangeable with the ksh et al. use of ERR as a magic trap.

The zsh equivalent is

	trap 'echo alert-an-error-occured' ZERR

A possible workaround would be

	(( $signals[(I)ERR] )) || alias -g ERR=ZERR

} P.S., someone left conflict cruft in ChangeLog.

"cvs annotate" is great for finding someones.

I deleted the cruft.
