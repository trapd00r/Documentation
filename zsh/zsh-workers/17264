I was puzzling as to why this allows jobs|less to work but not
(jobs) or cat <(jobs) when I realised that if I have two background
jobs, (jobs) will print the second job only. So perhaps this isn't quite
right yet? I don't really understand it though so I'm not sure why.
Hopefully something trivial because it'd be nice to have this working.

And, a minor point is that the clone module didn't compile - just the
missing new parameter to clearjobtab.
