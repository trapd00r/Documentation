I presume that a simple cat without a loop on this files works...

Could you tell us the how-many'th (heck, how does one say `wievielte'
in English?) cat this is? The 24'th or 48'th, perchance?

And, to repeat Bart's question: in which states are the cat and zsh?
(I.e. what does ps say, with as much information as possible, please,
even signal masks if your ps can give them).

Bye
 Sven

P.S.: And it's a slightly different loop, right?
