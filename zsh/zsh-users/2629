From: Peter Stephenson <pws@ibmth.df.unipi.it>

I'm trying to put together a guide to help users with zsh.  It'll be a long
haul, but I've made an attempt at a first chapter (not counting an
introduction) on the subject of initialization files and what to put in
them.   You can find it at
  http://www.ifh.de/~pws/computing/zshguide_intro.html
(this is likely to change eventually, but what isn't?)

Comments are welcome, of course.  It's possible that eventually it will
have to broken down to something more gentle in places with the hard stuff
moved later on.
