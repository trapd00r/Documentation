Hmmm... (R) was documented to refer to the last match found, so anyone
relying on it replacing something at the beginning (or, indeed, doing
anything well-defined at all) on a failure is making unwarranted
assumptions.  Still, if this is going to cause multiple hard to find
problems it's going to be a continuing nuisance.

It would be nice to be able to detect if the index is going to be used
for something other than extracting a single element and use the first
index if so, but the current interface doesn't make that easy.
