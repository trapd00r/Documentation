Subject: commas in brace expansion unescape on second completion
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8; format=flowed
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Content-Disposition: inline

% zsh -f
% touch abc,def ab1234
% ls a<tab> -> ab => ab{c<tab> -> ab{c\,def, => ab{c\,def,1<tab> ->
ab{c,def,1234, => ab{c,def,1234}<enter>
ls: cannot access abc: No such file or directory
ls: cannot access abdef: No such file or directory
ab1234

Why is the \ removed from the comma when pressing tab at the 1?
