Hi Andy,
you are right, my example was silly :-)  I choose it only for
simplicity. Actually I'm going to use Peter's suggestion to put the
output of a program in the shell killring, something like

myprogram | copythis

of course in this case copythis should be something like

copythis() { copy_this=`cat -` }

But if you know a better mechanism to do the same, I'm eager to learn!

Ciao,
Giulio.

P.S.: In any case, what about

copythis "bla $TERM bla"

?
