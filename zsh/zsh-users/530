Actually, I have found that this is not true.  For example, this works
perfectly fine for me:

echo "ftp mywhateverhost
$LOGNAME
mypassword
bin
get flotsam.tar
bye" > .tmpfile
telnet myloginhost < .tmpfile > ftp.log

I have seen this used to telnet to port 22 on a random host to sonnect to
sendmail and spoof one's return address. 

For this man, however, that there is a mechanism already created to
do what he needs.  Look up the man page on the .netrc file.  It specifies
this sort of information for ftp depending on the hostname - quite
convenient, and better than this method.  

                                            --N.
