I assume this calls for voices more authoritative than mine;
nevertheless, as someone who took part in its discussion and tested it,
I can only recommend this patch -- it fixes a real and visible problem
with the current git completion.

(I also remember a user complaint about the current incorrect behaviour
in the #zsh channel on Freenode -- that was actually what instigated my
interest in fixing the problem myself originally)
