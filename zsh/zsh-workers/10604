I have

PS4='+%1N:%i%1(_.:%_.): '

This used to display e.g.

zagzig<3> echo bar
+zsh-3.1.6-dev-20:3: echo bar

Now it displays:

zagzig<3> echo bar
+                                                                                :3: echo bar

(There's a huge amount of whitespace between the `+' and the `:', in case
your mail viewer has wrapped the line.)
