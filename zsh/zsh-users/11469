Hi
Don't know where to start with this shell or Perl.

I have an html template file which contains two fields xx_ and yy_

I need to generate a number of copies of pages from this template each time 
replacing the fields xx_ and yy_ with values from a list.

The list contains 49 xx_ yy_ pairs eg

11,234
15,235
21,236
..
..
etc

So I want to create 49 pages each populated from one pair from the list

ideas?
