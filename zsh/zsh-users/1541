Is there some way to have zsh expand aliases at a particular part of
a compctl?  I would like to be able to type "sudo alias_name" and
have sudo run the aliased command, but I with my limited knowledge
of compctl, I haven't been able to accomplish this.  I'm currently
using "compctl -l '' sudo" to complete aliases, but neither this nor
the -c option seem to do what I want.
