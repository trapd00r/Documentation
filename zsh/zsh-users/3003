"bindkey -D main" *does* succeed.  The error message is from ZLE,
starting up to edit the next command line, noticing that it can't select
the keymap.  Its behaviour is to fall back on the .safe keymap (see the
"KEYMAPS" section of zshzle(1)).

You almost certainly don't want to delete keymap main.  To create a
completely new keymap, create one with "bindkey -N", giving it a new name,
then you can add to it as much as you want while it's not selected.
*Then* use "bindkey -A" to make "main" a link to your new keymap.
(And presuming that you want to save the keymap permanently, use "bindkey
-L" to dump the keymap in the form of the commands needed to poulate it.)
