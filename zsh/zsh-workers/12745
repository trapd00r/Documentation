I almost changed the predict-on style index entries to read "predictive
typing style" but that's too long to fit in the space info allots.

Perhaps "widget style", since it's for a ZLE widget?  (But there are
completion widgets, too, so ...)

Can you explain what's "messed up" in a bit more detail?  (I didn't put
a cross-reference in there; perhaps that's what you think went wrong?)

This patch also throws in some words of wisdom about completers for the
