Subject: precmd, preexec, and supplied prompt themes

Hi folks:

I noticed most of the prompt themes use precmd and often preexec.

If either or both of these two functions are defined upstream, they  
get clobbered.

Is there a simple way to prepend or append additional arguments to  
these (or any) functions?  I've been doing something like this, but  
it seems hackish:

precmdarray=( $(which precmd | grep -v precmd | grep -v \}) )


function precmd { $precmdarray  "all the other stuff" }

Thanks.


Bill Scott
