Assuming you're using the new completion system, you can arrange the
file-patterns style appropriately.  For example,

zstyle ':completion:*:*:(emacs|vi):*' file-patterns \
    '*.(c|h|pl|tex|txt):globbed-files *(-/):directories' '*:all-files'

The best description of this is on page 398 of From Bash to Zsh, by
Oliver who may have a more comprehensive answer.
