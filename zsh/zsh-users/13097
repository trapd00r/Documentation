I've had some issues building ZSH from CVS on AIX. Turns out it doesn't
build zsh.texi, which requires yodl to build.

http://www.xs4all.nl/~jantien/yodl/ says it's been discontinued for 13 years
now.. (4 years in 1999 when that page was last updated).

I'm also having a hard time finding the thing on any ftp mirror (it's been
taked down). Finally managed to track in down in a Debian repo.

Is there a specific reason zsh doesn't move to texinfo or something or is
there an updated version of yodl around (I've failed to find one).
