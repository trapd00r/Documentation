If it were sourced from /etc/zprofile, then it would be sourced only if
the shell were a login shell, because that's the rule for /etc/zprofile.

You may not need to read those files.  It depends on what the sysadmin

language environment won't be set up correctly if you don't read them.
I don't know about SuSE.
