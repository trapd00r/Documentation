} The patch below implements this (with a few extras).

Nifty!  Now I only have one question ... is there another, better letter
than `o' that could be adopted (since the mode is no longer `o'ctal),
thus giving us both o and O for ascending/descending sorts, as in the
parameter flags?

(I'd ask about this on zsh-users first, though, just in case anybody is
making some important use of the old undocumented `o'.)
