The point is if something else needs it in the environment, you don't
have a choice and it's going to clash with the zsh internals anyway.
I'm not currently aware of anything else.

On the whole, that's probably a good idea, but I'm not convinced
wholesale rewriting of existing modules is necessary.  It depends how
generic a module is.  Even starting things with 'Z' isn't necessarily
enough.
