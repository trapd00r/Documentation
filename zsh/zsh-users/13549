The thing is read doesn't read from fd 0 (not does it write its
prompt or the echoed and controlling characters to fd 0, 1 or 2)
but from/to a fd that was open to the attached terminal upon
start and some that's some fd over 10 so probably hard to
redirect (if I use strace here, I see it reads and writes to fd
11).

You may want to consider the "clone" feature:

info --index-search=clone zsh

>   builtin print -- "$line" >&${_Dbg_fdi}

ITYM
print -r -- "$line"

<> was Bourne already (though I beleive early versions had
issues with it), so it should be recognised by every Bourne-like
shell.
