Personally I find _arguments a whole lot more readable than
_regex_arguments. If that could be improved, I'd be glad.

Although I always wonder why people find _cvs difficult...

I would be *very* glad if _regex_arguments could at least handle the
tags, tag-labels and descriptions. I had lots of problems trying to
work those changes into the functions using _regex_arguments and since 
I don't know any of those commands I still don't know if I've got it
right.

Either in _regex_arguments or in a convenience wrapper function around 
it, of course.

Bye
 Sven
