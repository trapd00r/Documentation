The trick is a - starts an option, so you have to say you aren't
giving any more options with the standard method:
bindkey -- - whatever

You have to do that when aliasing something beginning with + or - too:
alias -- +x='chmod +x'

I just noticed now though that I had just one hyphen in my .zshrc and
that works too, so I'm not sure which is canonical, both appear to
work though.
