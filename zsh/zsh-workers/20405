I suppose it's plausible, since the addition is transparent.  We
currently have something along the lines of sh being traditional Bourne
shell, ksh and being more or less a superset of sh (though somebody
pointed out a few weeks ago that ksh doesn't seem to have the effect of
sh_file_expansion).  Given that there are differences between ksh and
posix, a new option would probably be necessary.

However, the only use of posix would be to switch to it automatically in
the appropriate place.  If you have to trigger it by hand it's too late
for most of the places where people want to guarantee Posix compliance.
How would that be triggered?  Some (gag) environment variable?
