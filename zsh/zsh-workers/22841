If you want something done, do it yourself.

That's basically the mantra for completion definitions as well as many
other things; especially when they are free/open-software things.
People tend to define completions for commands they use themselves,
and as you use pinfo, you're in a perfect position to write one.

And remember, you'll (hopefully) be mentioned in the ChangeLog for all
eternity for your contribution.
