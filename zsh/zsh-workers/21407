No.

the problem is, you can't incrementally add UNICODE support to completion. =
You=20
must rewrite the *whole* completion code. Unfortunately the author is no mo=
re=20
reacheable and apparently no one has time and guts to punge into it.

I really begin to suspect that rewriting completion from scratch (retaining=
=20
functionality but adding it in small pieces) would be easier :(
