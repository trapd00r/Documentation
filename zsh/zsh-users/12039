====================

taking it a step further into zsh-ization...
 	PAGER=${$(whence -p most):t}

aesthetic issues aside, is there any reason not to include the full path 
of the pager in PAGER? the only reason i can think of is if it's defined 
in one zshrc used on multiple systems ("/usr/bin/most" or 
"/usr/local/bin/most"?) but if it's assigned dynamically, it should be 
safe with a full path.
