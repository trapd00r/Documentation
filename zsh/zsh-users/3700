Yes, I once thought about trying to do that.  It can get pretty
complicated, though (with -T and -t and stuff).  I was just too fed up 
with compctl to mess with it again...

And I'm not sure about this.  Writing a working converter is already
non-trivial, writing one that produces nice code even more so.

Hm, if seconds are accurate enough this would be extremely simple to
add using $SECONDS.

It's the default behaviour: leading path segments are accepted as they 
are if there are files below them that can be matched by the rest of
the partially given path.
