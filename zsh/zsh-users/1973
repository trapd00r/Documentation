~squid/logs foo=/usr/local/bin/mumble
~squid/logs echo $foo[(ws:/:)-1]      
mumble
~squid/logs foo=/usr/local/bin/mumble/
~squid/logs echo $foo[(ws:/:)-1]
mumble


This makes foo an array with the word separator `/' and gives the last
element in that array.

I am sure there are otherways to do this but this works for me.
