The other advantage of this is that, as Sven has pointed out, we can handle 
systems with RTLD_LAZY by loading first and asking questions afterwards.
The difference between these two methods is then transparent to the user
--- we don't have extra files on some systems and not on others.

At least, I hope we can handle RTLD_LAZY like that... only function objects
can be lazy, data objects can't be, at least under Solaris.  There may be
cases where we have data dependencies and this won't work.
