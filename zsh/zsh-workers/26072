} Same on OpenBSD.

On linux, I get this:

schaefer<501> cd ..
Completing directory in cdpath
.gimp-2.0/         .gstreamer-0.8/    zsh-3.0.5/         zsh-3.0.8-pre/=20=
=20=20
.rhopenoffice1.1/  .emacs.d/          zsh-3.1.6/

(The cursor backs up to be located between the two dots.)

In _path_files, it appears that the change from

      # `clever' filing systems where names pop into existence
      # when referenced.
      if (( ! $#tmp1 )); then

to

      # we only do this once for completion of each path segment.
      if (( ! $#tmp1 && npathcheck =3D=3D 0 )); then

is causing the existence check

	  if [[ -e "$tmp3${(Q)PREFIX}${(Q)SUFFIX}" ]] then

to be skipped.  Therefore ".." is never added as a possible completion.
It appears we may need another special case.
