I have just uploaded new docs (before seeing Peter's recent message).
I've not got a TeX installation so haven't bothered with the PDF, ps
and dvi files.

These are only at sunsite.dk/dotsrc.org. Sourceforge has changed things
around a lot and you have to jump through hoops just to ssh in and then
it can't rsync the stuff anyway (failed to connect to zsh.sunsite.dk:
No route to host (113)). If anyone wants to try, the appropriate command
is: rsync -aqz zsh.sunsite.dk::zsh /home/groups/z/zs/zsh/htdocs
Probably need to sftp it up instead.

If anyone with more time than me wants to do some work on the zsh web
pages, I'll be happy to upload them assuming we can't find someone at
sunsite.dk to add them.

Oliver
