I'd rather we didn't.  rename(2) is atomic, but there's no reasonable way
to make cp+rm be so, and I think it's better if the user is forced to be
aware of the issue.

Also note that "cp" is (intentionally) NOT one of the commands supplied
by the zsh/files module, so changing mv means implementing cp.
