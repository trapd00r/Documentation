Not at all, IMHO.

I just think that the colors function would load quite a lot of
redundant information, if these are added as well. Maybe these
definitions could be added by a new function (e.g. prompt_colors).

Of course you could add code like:

[snip]
for i in ${(k)fg} ; do pfg[$i]="%{$fg[$i]%}" ; done
[snap]

to your .zshrc, but I guess a loadable function would be easier for
new users.

As an addition:
Today a user asked on IRC how to print out blinking text with the help
of the autoloadable colors function. I told him that, this would do:

[snip]
blink="\e[${color[blink]}m"
[snap]

Maybe it would be helpful to add this to the colors function:

[snip]
blink_color="$lc${color[blink]}$rc"
[snap]
