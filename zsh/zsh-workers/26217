Hi all,

bug 257336[1] made me think of something that has annoyed me
for ages, but never enough to actually send email to the list:

richih@roadwarrior ~ % figlet
zsh: correct 'figlet' to '_figlet'? [N/y/a/e]

I don't know enough about zsh internas to guesstimate if this is
an easy fix or not. Two possible solutions which come to mind:

1) Make zsh aware of what functions came in through $FPATH
and which came in through $PATH so the correction function
does not even see them when looking for other executable
commands.

2) Make the completion function do the filtering outlined in 1)


Richard
