Just a followup.  This is still a bug in 3.1.6-pws-6. I originally
reported it on 3.1.6-pws-5.   I also tested on 3.1.6 and it is the
same.

=== /home/gabor $ cd /

=== //tmp $ print $ZSH_VERSION
3.1.6-pws-6

=== //tmp $ cd /
=== / $ cd tmp
=== /tmp $

It's obviously affected by the setting of chaselinks.  Any comments?
