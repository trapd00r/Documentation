-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

Sorry, I wanted to pgp sign the previous mail but just after I signed
it, I realized that I forgot to indent the patch so I returned to the
editor to indent it.  But efter that elm did not alow to sign it
again saying that I cannot use pgp twice on the same message.  But
before I realized this I pressed the send button.  Sorry.  The mail
was still readable and it was really me who wrote it (I just need
some sleep you know).

Zoltan
