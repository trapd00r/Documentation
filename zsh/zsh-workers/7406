	Fyi:

1) On both BSD/OS 3.1 and 4.0.1, configure erroneously #defines
   TGETENT_ACCEPTS_NULL, leading to a coredump later on in tgetstr() in
   init.c:489:

Starting program: /home/jos/src/zsh-3.0.6/Src/zsh

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x280c8824 in cgetcap ()
(gdb) where
#0  0x280c8824 in cgetcap ()
#1  0x280c94b2 in cgetstr ()
#2  0x2809b899 in tgetstr ()
#3  0x8062194 in init_term ()

#8  0x80626fd in setupvals ()
#9  0x80616c7 in main ()
#10 0x8049ff4 in __start ()
(gdb) 

Undefining TGETENT_ACCEPTS_NULL in config.h fixes the problem.

2) On 4.0.1 (but not 3.1), I am seeing the following for every sourcefile:

gcc -c -I.. -I. -I.  -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -Wall -Wno-implicit -Wmissing-prototypes -O2 builtin.c
In file included from system.h:58,
                 from zsh.h:59,
                 from builtin.c:30:
/usr/include/stdio.h:378: warning: no previous prototype for `__sputaux'

gcc is the system-supplied version 2.7.2.1 in both cases.

The shell built seems to work fine though.


Cheers,
