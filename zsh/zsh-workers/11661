I know that I wasn't going to post these patches anymore but I have this
time because with this one only being caused this morning, I've missed
3.1.7 so 3.1.7 as released is not a clean compile on AIX.

What might be a good idea is to get sourceforge to mirror ftp and web
from sunsite Denmark. We're allowed cron jobs so it should be quite
possible to setup. Does anyone have a script or something similar which
they use for their zsh mirror (or whatever else). What would be the best
way for me to do it - wget?
