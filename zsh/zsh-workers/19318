If you don't have curses, the shell should build successfully without
building terminfo.so --- nothing more to test.

If you do have curses, it should build successfully and produce a
terminfo.so which, after installation, is loadable.  You can test it
from the newly installed shell like this:

zmodload zsh/terminfo
echoti cols

which should output a number, but anything other than a linking error or
`feature not available' is good news.

Any feedback is very useful.
