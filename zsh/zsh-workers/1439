unhash -a and unalias are (internal) aliases for the same thing.
The same is true for unfunction and unhash -f.

It just worked out that when I has rewriting all the hash table
code that I could easily overload unhash to handle unalias and
unfunction.  The fact that you can also use unhash -a and unhash -f
is unimportant.

To try to improve the symmetry any further would just needlessly
complicate the code with little gain.
