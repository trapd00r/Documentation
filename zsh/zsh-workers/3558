Hi

Dunno if there was a patch for this before...

In 3.1.2 autoloaded functions are implemented by making them
(internally) functions which load themselves. For this there is a new
struct autofn and a corresponding description in utils.c.
This descriptions says that the struct has one extra integer that
should be copied in dupstruct2(). But in fact there is a pointer which
should be copied directly. Due to sizeof(int) != sizeof(Shfunc) on an
Alpha this doesn't copy the pointer, leaving it zero, causing a SEGV
later on.
The patch below is probably a bit simple (-minded), but it works.

Bye
 Sven
