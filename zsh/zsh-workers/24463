Hm, the original code has changed dramatically since I began
writing the patches, and I don't have the time to do it again from
scratch.  All I can do is to offer the original author of the git
completion stuff to take the last two patches as a base to rewrite
his own completion code to

1) handle GIT_DIR and --git-dir=,
2) copy without git-ls-remote (which ist *slooow* and potentially
   requires a network connection),
3) improve git-branch completion.

Actually, the use of git-ls-remote renders the current git
completion pretty much useless for me as I am not going to wait
four seconds for the completion list or tags and heads to be
built.  Until there's a solution for this problem I'll just have
to use my own version of git completion.  Sorry.

Ciao
