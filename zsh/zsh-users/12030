I still haven't seen a good reason for Zsh to not deal with this error
condition appropriately, besides worries that Zsh start creating
directories.  This argument fails, because we actually asked it to
store a file in that directory, so we probably won't mind if Zsh makes
sure it exists when it's needed.

I'm sorry, but how does it solve 99% of all cases?  There are two cases:

1.  $HISTFILE:h exists when writing $HISTFILE
2.  $HISTFILE:h does not exist when writing $HISTFILE

The above solution makes case 1 more likely, sure, but it doesn't solve case 2.
