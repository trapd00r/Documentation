Oh, yes.  I had to look at the code before the answer came to me,
again---I've run up against this one several times before.

It's not a bug because it's documented to do something incredibly
pointless:

  For historical reasons, the usual behaviour that empty array elements
  are retained inside double quotes is disabled for arrays generated
  by splitting; hence the following:

  example(line="one::three"
  print -l "${(s.:.)line}")

  produces two lines of output for tt(one) and tt(three) and elides the
  empty field.  To override this behaviour, supply the "(@)" flag as well,
  i.e.  tt("${(@s.:.)line}").

Not sure why RC_EXPAND_PARAM makes it work more sensibly, however.
