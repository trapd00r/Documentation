I have a better solution. stderr is redirected with

  exec 2>>(while read line; do
    print '\e[91m'${(q)line}'\e[0m' > /dev/tty; done &)

as you suggested (this avoids the coprocess in the jobs table).

Now, in precmd(), adding the following line solves the problem:

  sleep 0

Of course, this won't completely avoid the race condition, but it
improves things in pratice. I assume that this forces the scheduler
to switch to another process, and in practice, the coprocess is
scheduled before precmd() is resumed.
