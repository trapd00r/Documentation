> You can use $'\u00e4' which wouldn't be quite so ugly.

This solution is implemented in the package 4.3.4-dev-4-1 and does not work!

With LANG=3Dde_DE.UTF-8 I have to use $'\\u00e4' in the command line
but I did not find a solution that is working in a completion file.

PS: I tested my suggested solution (gew$(print \\u00e4)hlten)!
