} Ah, it's magic you want.

No, though I'll take it now that you've offered. :-)  I just expected
the cursor to end up at least as far to the right (within the word)
as it started.

Instead it would do things like move from the right end of a longer
word, to one space to the left of the end of a shorter one.  It was
this extra leftward motion that puzzled me.
