Of course, now that I tried it again, it seems to work (at least if
your terminal has the capability of clearing to EOD).

But still, Id' be glad if our refresh-code experts could have a look
at this, because the code now sets the cursor to the last column of
the last prompt line and gives out a TCCLEAREOD -- and doing that when 
not in the first column may be undefined on some terminals if I
remember correctly.
