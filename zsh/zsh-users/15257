Most Linux distributions I've used, including Fedora and Ubuntu, come
with /etc/.zshrc and the likes that suite the distribution's taste of
what is a good setup - and fits well with the rest of the software that
their users normally run. I personally hate it, because it forces silly
aliases (like colorful ls) and stupid configration options that I don't want
to use. But I can see how other people might like it...

Myself, the first thing I do on fresh fedora installations or upgrades is
"rm /etc/z* :-)

I don't think the solution has to be to have /etc/.zshrc and the likes.
A different solution could be to have useful defaults. What kind of things
would you like to be defaults that aren't defaults now?

I agree that useful features should not be hidden behind options that nobody
would guess. For example, "auto_menu" is a very useful feature that didn't
use to exist in other shells, and also wasn't the default in zsh. Now it
is the default. However, in my opinion, the current defaults are still not
perfect - e.g., I wish nomatch was off by default, correct was on,
interactivecomments was on, listbeep was off, and numericglobsort was on.
