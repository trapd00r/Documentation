It would be great if the cygwin version of zsh could be built straight out of
the zsh cvs repository. (Or at least with minimal patching.)

Are there any additional resources in the cygwin port that are not included in
the cvs tree?  I know of at least one script, mkzsh, that is missing from cvs. 

-FR.
