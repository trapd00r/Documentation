I added another trick: It annoyed me that if I go back in history and change
my mind, pressing interrupt now will save the whatever command I moved back
to again in the front of the history. I wanted the interrupt key to only save
a new command.
So I added a check for this, using the HISTNO and HISTCMD variables we have
access to: If those are equal, we're editing a new command, but if they're
not, we're on an old command from the history:

# When a line is killed, put it in the history anyway in case we want to
# return to it
TRAPINT() {
        # Store the current buffer in the history.
        zle && 
        [[ $HISTNO -eq $HISTCMD ]] && # only if we're not back in the history
        print -s -r -- $BUFFER

        # Return the default exit code so zsh aborts the current command.
        return $1
}
