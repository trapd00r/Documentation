I didn't mean to imply _git was not "good enough". Obviously it is
sufficient for the people that are using it, otherwise there would be
much more work being done on it than currently is. But that doesn't mean
it can't and shouldn't be improved.

Maybe. I've seen some _git patches lying on this list for several weeks
before being applied, but recently that seems to be an exception. So
yeah, if someone from the Git side gets more involved and sends patches
every now and then and they get applied in reasonable time, there might
be no difference.

AIUI the "maintaining a file in two places" idea was conditioned by some
kind of synchronization scheme, i.e. you could use either of the versions,
because they would just be the same most of the time.

Failing that, it seems to me (having been following both zsh-workers and
the Git list for some time) that having _git in Git (given there are
people who'd work on it, see my previous mail), and possibly just using
this list for getting advice when they're stuck or want to discuss
something with more Zsh users, might be more effective, esp. on the
synchronization front (the Bash completion changes often get committed
immediately after the corresponding Git feature is added).

I don't see how it would increase the work.
