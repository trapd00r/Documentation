the following url might be helpful for showing how to do local inclusion 
of vim mode in the zsh prompt:

http://pthree.org/2009/03/28/add-vim-editing-mode-to-your-zsh-prompt/

i have no problems using both techniques, incremental history searches and 
prompt-embedded vim mode indication, in my sessions.  it is quite 
functional. i am running a recent version of the shell, 4.3.10-dev-1, 
patchlevel 1.4766, on linuxen, bsd's, and cygwin (xp and win7); same 
behaviour on all platforms.
