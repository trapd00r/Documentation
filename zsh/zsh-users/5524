It certainly looks like a similar hack of some sorts.  None of

   true | { jobs; }
   true | ( jobs; )
   function j { jobs; }; true | j

produce any output in the version of bash we have here (which probably isn't
up to date).  It so happens that with the hack we use, the special
case survives for the equivalent code on the left hand side of the pipe,
but a hack is a hack...
