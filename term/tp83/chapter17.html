<H2>Overview</H2>
<P>The versatile LXY12 and LXY22 are medium-duty printing devices that combine
the benefits of a dot-matrix printer and a plotter on many of Digital's UNIBUS PDP-11
and VAX systems. When used as lineprinters, the LXY family is compatible with
Digital's other lineprinters, need no special software, and are supported by the RT-11,
RSX-11, RSTS/E, and VMS operating systems. When used with Digital's PLXY-11
and BCP graphics software packages, you have full access to all the LXY plotting
capabilities. PLXY-11 is currently supported by Digital's RT-11, RSX-11M, RSX-11M-PLUS,
RSTS/E, and VME operating systems, while BCP is supported by the RSX-11M
and VMS operating systems.</P>
<P>Designed for use during a standard eight-hour shift in scientific, industrial, and
commercial marketplaces, the LXY family of graphics lineprinters accommodates
complex, intricate designs. In addition, the LXY12 and LXY22 provide hardcopy
output of designs formulated on a graphics terminal, combine text and graphics in a
single report, and produce simple forms.</P>
<P>Plotting capabilities, made possible with the PLXY-11 graphics software package,
include standard line drawings, (for example, graphs, histograms, and charts)
along with plots requiring shaded or solid areas (for example, bar graphs). The BCP
Barcode/Block Character software is ideally suited to industrial and distributive
applications where products must be coded and labeled using preprinted stationery
and/or gummed labels.</P>
<P>The freestanding LXY12 and LXY22 systems include a controller if required by
the configuration, a cable for connecting the controller to the graphics lineprinters,
a pedestal with basket and paper guide, and a choice of two software package &#8211;
the PLXY-11 graphics software and the BCP barcode package.</P>
<P>The LXY12 produces high-quality output at speeds of up to 300 lines per minute
when printing and up to 42.4 centimeters per minute when plotting. The
LXY22, a higher-speed device than the LXY12, prints up to 600 lines per minute
and plots up to 84.6 centimeters per minute. The <CITE>PDP-11</CITE> and <CITE>VAX Systems and
Options Catalogs</CITE> contain ordering information for different versions of the LXY
family.</P>
<P>The following LXY series models are available.</P>

<H2>Major Features</H2>
<P>The LXY family's main features are:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Printing and plotting capabilities &#8211; Allows you to combine both text and
graphics within a single document</LI>
<LI>Overlapping dot-print technology &#8211; Creates excellent, uniform density print
quality</LI>
<LI>PLXY-11 graphics software package &#8211; Provides unique plotting capabilities for
graphics, histograms and charts</LI>
<LI>BCP Barcode/Block Character software package &#8211; Permits coding and labeling
on preprinted stationery and gummed labels, as well as the creation of forms</LI>
<LI>Standard programmable vertical forms unit &#8211; Operates under program control
and allows slewing to top of form and slewing within a form to a preselected line</LI>
<LI>Hammer bank print mechanism &#8211; Eliminates wear that occurs with single
printhead printers</LI>
</UL>
<H2>Printing and Graphics Features</H2>
<P>In both the LXY12 and the LXY22, printing is accomplished by a bank of spring
hammers. The LXY12 hammer bank has 44 hammers, while the LXY22 has 66.
These hammers, mounted on a shuttle, are positioned horizontally at every third
character position for the LXY12 and every second position for the LXY22. As the
shuttle sweeps the hammers back and forth across the character positions, the
hammers are activated at each position in which a dot is required. Each hammer
prints a single dot.</P>
<H3>Printing</H3>
<P>The LXY family of graphics lineprinters achieves excellent print quality by overlapping
dots of 0.05 centimeters (0.02 inches) in diameter, on a dot matrix of nine-by-seven
dots or nine-by-nine dots, anywhere on a page. The nine-by-seven matrix
enables the printer to overlap dots both horizontally and vertically resulting in
solid-looking characters and lines produced with uniform density. The nine-by-nine
matrix is used for lower case letters with descenders, such as the letters "p",
"q" and "y".</P>
<P>Double-height characters, as well as underlining are standard features with the
LXY12/LXY22.</P>
<P>The LXY12 produces high-quality print at speeds of up to 300 lines per minute,
240 lines per minute when underlining or printing lowercase characters with
descenders, and 170 lines per minute for double-height characters.</P>
<P>High-speed output of 600 lines per minute is provided by the LXY22 and is suitable
for draft and data printing. When underlining or printing lowercase characters
with descenders, the output is 465 lines per minute. The LXY22 prints double-height
characters at the rate of 320 lines per minute.</P>
<P>When used as plotters, the LXY plots up to 42 centimeters per minute (16.7
inches per minute), while the LXY22 plots up to 84.6 centimeters per minute (33.3
inches per minute). Since the LXY12 and the LXY22 print overlapping dots anywhere
on the page, plots are always sharp and uniformly dense.</P>

</TABLE>
<H2>Character Sets</H2>
<P>The LXY12/LXY22 prints the full 94-character printable ASCII set. Character form
is electronically determined by codes stored in PROM devices, which are accessed
by the received character codes. Up to 160 different characters may be printed by
installing additional PROM devices. Optional character set PROMs includes
EBCDIC, Katakana, Farsi, Arabic, Hebrew, Greek, Cyrillic and special character
sets, such as OCR.</P>
<P>Characters are printed in a line up to 132 characters wide.</P>
<H2>Paper</H2>
<P>The LXY12/LXY22 accept continuous fanfold edge-perforated paper between 11.4
centimeters (4.5 inches) and 40.6 centimeters (16 inches) wide. They accept single-
or multipart carbon forms and can produce up to six copies of multipart carbon
forms, up to a maximum thickness of 0.06 centimeters (0.025 inches).</P>

</TBODY>
</TABLE>
<P>Six controls and indicators are found on the front panel of the LXY family of graphics
lineprinters.</P>
<H4>Power On/Off Toggle Switch</H4>
<P>This switch controls application of all power to the graphics lineprinter.</P>
<H4>Power Indicator</H4>
<P>When the POWER toggle switch is set to ON, power is applied to the graphics lineprinter
and the indicator goes on.</P>
<H4>Paper Advance Pushbutton</H4>
<P>While held down, this button advances the paper at the slew rate.</P>
<H4>Check Pushbutton/Indicator</H4>
<P>When lit, this button indicates one of the following error conditions.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Paper is not loaded properly.</LI>
<LI>Paper has run out.</LI>
<LI>Paper is jammed.</LI>
<LI>Paper is torn.</LI>
<LI>Cover is left open.</LI>
<LI>Forms thickness adjustment lever is left up.</LI>
<LI>Any internal supply voltage is abnormal.</LI>
</UL>
<P>The light goes out when the fault is cleared. After reloading paper, press the CHECK
button and the light will go out.</P>
<H4>Top of Form Pushbutton/Indicator</H4>
<P>This advances the paper to the top of the next form, or to the top of the form specified
by the EVFU, if loaded. This switch operates only when the printer is off-line.</P>
<H4>8LPI Pushbutton/Indicator</H4>
<P>This switch selects either eight lines per inch (lit), or six lines per inch (unlit). This
button operates only when the printer is off-line.</P>
<H4>On-Line Pushbutton/Indicator</H4>
<P>This switch enables or disables printer control through the interface. When the
switch is lit, the interface is enabled. The printer cannot not go on-line if the
CHECK indicator is lit.</P>
<H2>Operation</H2>
<P>The LXY12 and the LXY22 have two internal registers: the Control and Status Register
(LXCS) and the Data Buffer Register (LXDB). (Refer to Appendix J.)</P>
<P>When the READY bit in the control and status register is set, the graphics lineprinter
is ready to accept a character from the processor.</P>
<P>The processor loads characters one by one into the data buffer register in the controller.
The controller then transfers the characters to a 132-character data buffer in
the graphics lineprinter. The line length of 132 characters corresponds directly to
this 132-character data buffer.</P>
<TABLE ID="F17-2" CLASS="figure" WIDTH="100%">
<CAPTION>Figure 17-2 LXY12/LXY22 System Block Diagram</CAPTION>
<TBODY>
<TR>
<TD ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="fig1702" ALT=""></TD>
</TR>
</TBODY>
</TABLE>
<P>The current data buffer register (LXDB) contents are automatically printed out
whenever either of the two control codes (Line Feed, Form Feed) is recognized. The
Line Feed (LF) code advances the paper one line while the Form Feed (FF) code
advances the paper to the top of the next page. If neither of these control codes is
recognized, the contents of the data buffer will automatically be printed out when it
is full.</P>
<P>An Elongate code (010<SUB>8</SUB>) anywhere in a line of characters, causes the entire line
to be printed double-height. To underline certain characters in a line, a Carriage
Return (CR) code (015<SUB>8</SUB>) is sent following the line of characters, which causes the
lineprinter to wait for a line of control characters specifying which of the characters
in the line already sent are to be underlined. Unlike the Elongate code which
causes an entire line to be printed double-height, the Carriage Return code causes
only those characters specified to be underlined.</P>
<P>The Electronic Vertical Format Unit (EVFU) allows you, under program control,
to use a variety of form lengths. By specifying a number of lines at the slew
speed, you can skip to a preassigned point in the form specified by the VFU channel
number. Forms may be as long as 132 lines at six lines per inch.</P>
<P>A Plot Mode code (005<SUB>8</SUB>) anywhere in a line of characters causes the lineprinter
to plot the entire line instead of print. When plotting, only one row of dots is printed
at a time, and the paper advances only one dot row with each Line Feed code
(012<SUB>8</SUB>). The characters are printed as a stream of binary bits; that is each 1 bit prints
as a dot and each 0 bit prints as a blank dot space.</P>
<H2>Special Nonprinting ASCII Control Codes</H2>
<P>More information on this subject can be found in Appendix A.</P>
<H3>Elongate (010<SUB>8</SUB>)</H3>
<P>The Elongate code, sent anywhere in a line of characters, causes the entire line to
be printed double-height.</P>
<H3>Carriage Return (015<SUB>8</SUB>)</H3>
<P>The Carriage Return code is used for underlining. It causes the lineprinter to wait
for a line of control code characters (Underline, Delete or Space) before printing out
the line of characters already in the data buffer register. Each control code character
sent corresponds to a data character currently in the data buffer register. An Underline
(137<SUB>8</SUB>) control code character causes the lineprinter to underline the corresponding
data character. A Delete (177<SUB>8</SUB>) control code character causes the lineprinter
to replace the corresponding data character with a blank space, and a Space
(040<SUB>8</SUB>) control code character causes the lineprinter to print the corresponding data
character unchanged.</P>
<H3>Shift Out (016<SUB>8</SUB>)</H3>
<P>The Shift Out code causes all subsequent characters to be selected from the
optional character set on the PROM currently in use.</P>
<H3>Shift In (017<SUB>8</SUB>)</H3>
<P>The Shift In code causes all subsequent characters to be selected from the ASCII
character set. A Shift In is automatically generated at the end of every line.</P>
<H3>Shift to 8 LPI (006<SUB>8</SUB>)</H3>
<P>The Shift to 8 LPI code causes the next Line Feed code (012<SUB>8</SUB>) to advance the paper
one-eighth of an inch for eight lines per inch spacing instead of the standard six
lines per inch. The lineprinter automatically resets itself to 6 LPI after the Line Feed
operation. Shift to 8 LPI is only operational when the 8 LPI switch on the lineprinter
is set to 6 LPI.</P>
<H3>Plot Mode (005<SUB>8</SUB>)</H3>
<P>The Plot Mode code (005<SUB>8</SUB>) sent anywhere in a line of characters causes the lineprinter
to plot the entire line instead of printing ASCII characters. There are 1,583
dot positions across the width of the paper, that is, 12 dot positions for each of the
132 characters. Plot Mode allows the printing of only the odd-numbered dots or six
dots per character. Bits 0-5 of each character correspond to the six printable dots of
that character space. The characters are printed as a stream of binary bits; that is
each 1 bit prints as a dot and each 0 bit prints as a blank dot space. For instance,
printing 101<SUB>8</SUB> (01 000 001<SUB>2</SUB>) causes only dot number 1 to be printed for that character;
printing 102<SUB>8</SUB> (01 000 010<SUB>2</SUB>) prints dot number 3; and printing 055<SUB>8</SUB> (00 101 101<SUB>2</SUB>)
prints dot numbers 1, 5, 7 and 11. Codes 100<SUB>8</SUB>-137<SUB>8</SUB> must be used instead of codes
000<SUB>8</SUB>-037<SUB>8</SUB>, which cannot be used to plot data because they are control codes and
will be interpreted as such, that is, Line Feed (012<SUB>8</SUB>).</P>
<H3>Double Density Plot Mode (004<SUB>8</SUB>)</H3>
<P>The Double Density Plot Mode (DDPM) code allows printing of all of the even dot
positions. A DDPM code sent anywhere in a line of characters causes the lineprinter
to plot the entire line instead of printing ASCII characters. Double Density
Plot Mode allows the printing of only the even-numbered dots or six dots per character.
Note that the Line Feed code at the end of the line of characters does not cause
the paper to advance. The DDPM code must always be followed by a Plot Mode
Code (005<SUB>8</SUB>), which fills in all of the odd-numbered dot positions.</P>
<H3>Start Load (036<SUB>8</SUB>)</H3>
<P>The Start Load code initializes the EVFU and causes all subsequent characters to be
loaded into the EVFU buffer.</P>
<H3>Stop Load (037<SUB>8</SUB>)</H3>
<P>The Stop Load code indicates the end of the characters to be loaded into the EVFU
buffer. The EVFU buffer allows storage of a Vertical Tab Stop code (channel) for
each line of the form. Forms may be up to 132 lines long. Vertical Tab Stops are
codes 020<SUB>8</SUB>-035<SUB>8</SUB>. A Vertical Tab Stop code sent anywhere in a line of characters
causes the paper to advance to the next PVFU line indicated by that Vertical Tab
Stop code at the next Line Feed code. Top of Form code 020<SUB>8</SUB> is always loaded into
line 1 in the PVFU buffer.</P>
<H2>Interrupts</H2>
<P>The LXY12/LXY22 system controller uses bus request (BR) interrupts to gain control
of the UNIBUS to perform a vectored interrupt, which causes the program to
branch to an interrupt service routine. A BR interrupt can occur only if the INTERRUPT
ENABLE bit in the control and status register is set. Once the INTERRUPT
ENABLE bit is set, an interrupt request is generated whenever either the READY or
ERROR bits in the control and status register is set.</P>
<P>When the READY bit is set, the graphics lineprinter is ready to accept a character
to be loaded into the data buffer register (LXDB). When the ERROR bit is set, it
indicates that some error condition exists. In this case, an interrupt is generated to
cause the program to branch to an error-handling routine.</P>
<P>The interrupt priority level is 4 and the interrupt vector address is 200. Note that
the priority level can be changed with a priority plug, and the vector address can be
changed by jumpers in the interrupt control logic. However, any of Digital's programs
or other software referring to the priority level or interrupt vector address
must also be changed if the priority plug or the vector address is changed.</P>
<H2>Maintenance</H2>
<P>Quality assurance means long life expectancy, high-quality output, and continuous
smooth performance by your LXY graphics lineprinter. Special design features of
the LXY family of lineprinters give these systems qualities of high reliability as well
as ease of maintenance.</P>
<UL>
<LI>The LXY12 and the LXY22 use hammer-bank print mechanisms and are therefore
not susceptible to the wear of single-head matrix printers.</LI>
<LI>The hammers seldom require adjustment or alignment. The hammer-bank
module can be easily removed since it is held in place by two screws.</LI>
<LI>Less chance of paper jams than with charaband printers since the paper moves
as it prints. As the paper advances each successive line of dots overlaps to form
solid-looking characters.</LI>
<LI>Fewer moving parts than charaband and drum printers and 50 percent fewer
components than mechanical font printers.</LI>
<LI>Modular construction enables parts to be quickly removed and replaced during
routine servicing and maintenance.</LI>
<LI>The LXY12 and the LXY22 freestanding unit is designed to give stable, quiet
operation below 65&nbsp;dB.</LI>
</UL>
<H3>Self-test procedure</H3>
<P>Depressing the CHECK and PAPER ADVANCE buttons simultaneously causes the
LXY series of graphics lineprinters to print lines of "E". This continues as long as
you hold the buttons down. If lines of "E" fail to print, contact your local Digital
field service representative for assistance.</P>
