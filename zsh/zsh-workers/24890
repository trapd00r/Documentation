Excellent - I wait with bated breath; that will be even more cool.  :)

Yep, spot on - After a backspace (backward-delete-char or
vi-backward-delete-char), we pop back up to the previous search
location.  If the search was failing at that location, we set skip_pos
to not try again at the current position, but if we then backspace
again to a valid state, we don't unset skip_pos - This is why it
needed two backspaces to trigger; we needed to go from a failing
state, to another failing state, to a good state that was being
treated as kinda-sorta-failed.

I think that the right fix is just unconditionally resetting skip_pos
right before we conditionally set it.
