} There are few, if any, reasons to use cat with zsh.
} 
} awk < $FILE '{print $1,$2}' | xargs -n 2 mv

There aren't all that many reasons to use awk and xargs, either.

	while read f1 f2 ; do mv $f1 $f2 ; done < $FILE

You should even be able to say

	while read f1 f2; { mv $f1 $f2 } < $FILE

but the `while LIST { LIST }` syntax appears to have been broken in various
different ways since 3.0-pre2 or earlier.  Has this been deprecated while I
wasn't looking, and just never removed from the info file?
