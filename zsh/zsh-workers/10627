I would have thought it would be far better to allow people to use their
favourite pager (as taken from $PAGER) instead of trying to write a
simple pager. How compilcated would it be to make the listing code
output to a pipe instead. There is actually a few times when I would
have liked to pipe completion listings through a command so if this
implemented, it would be useful to be able to specify another command
(such as grep) to pipe the listing into.
