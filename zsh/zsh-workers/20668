This seems like a reasonable complaint to me.  Is there a reason not to
be more grid-like?

----- Forwarded message from "Benjamin Hill (Mako)" <mako@debian.org> -----

Thanks for maintaining zsh (again)!

zsh menu navigation is confusing and implemented so that it makes
reaching the last element in a list of completions extremely
difficult.

In a multi-column menu of completions, pressing "up" from most items
will take the user to the previous item in the list. When an item that
is at the top of a column is selected, pressing "up" moves the
selection to the last item in the previous column.  This is the
correct behavior.

This does not happen when the users is on first item in the first
column. Pressing up from *this* item (and only this item) will take
the users to the last item in the first (current) column. It should
take the users to the last item in the list (i.e., the last item in
the last column).

The effect of this is that it can make it very hard to select the last
item in a long multi-column menu of completions. For date-based
organization of data in a directory, this can be particularly
frustrating.

Similarly, pressing down from the final column will select the item
that is one to the left and one down of the last item rather than the
first item (which would be expected). Pressing right from the last
item moves to the first column (as would be expected) but also moves
one down (which would not). Moving left from the first column acts
irregularly as well selecting items that are sometimes one up and
sometimes in the second-to-last column (depending on the layout).

This should all be normalized so that the normal operating is
grid-like movement (as it is in most places that do not involve edges
of the grid) and so that moving up from the first item or down from
that item moves to the end/beginning.
