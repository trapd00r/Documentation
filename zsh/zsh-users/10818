You should probably just add them to the log rotater config file.
Suse for example comes with a log rotater installed already and you just 
need to add file names to /etc/logrotate.conf

Or install your own.This is a simple one I've been using for years on sco 
systems.

This way they don't grow forever, nor do you lose data, until it grows old 
enough that you don't care about it and you decide how old that is, if ever. 
You could set it up to keep creating new date-based filenames forever if you 
wanted.
