First of all, note that unless command3 is return, the always block
is going to execute regardless of whether there has been an error.

How about:

    function common_error() {
	# Here we catch and handle the common error
	# In the ERROR_LINE variable we have the line number,
	# and in the ERROR variable we have the $? status,
	# just in case we want to fine tune error handling
    }

    trap 'ERROR=$?; ERROR_LINE=$LINENO; return $ERROR' ZERR
    trap common_error EXIT

    command1
    command2
    command3

    trap - EXIT ZERR

Note also for reference that
    trap 'return $?' ZERR
is roughly equivalent to
    setopt ERR_RETURN
