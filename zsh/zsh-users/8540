His situation is that the directory he is talking about has two names,=20
and if he refers to it as, say, ~a, the prompt shows ~b.  I've seen the=20
same thing, although I've never considered it difficult to work with, as =

long as (in his case) ~work gets you where you want to go.

For example, I have the following (and sorry if I'm misinterpreting the=20
question):

export UTILDIR=3D/a/b/c
export ud=3D$UTILDIR

then ~UTILDIR takes me to the correct place (since I have the setopt's=20
required to do this), but the prompt shows  ~ud, not ~UTILDIR.

It would, from my perspective, be nice to say   ~ud    and have it=20
displayed in the prompt as  ~UTILDIR (less typing, more meaningful prompt=
).

If this is not an anaologous situation, would someone please tell me=20
why, and how it relates to the original question?

TIA
