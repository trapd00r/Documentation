Hi all,

Congratulations on getting 3.1.<7-9> out the door.  This is an
exciting time for zsh!  (Unfortunately I missed most of it through
working hard for exams.)

With the latest CVS, it seems that completion of filenames containing
spaces is broken:

  % ls .mozilla/A<TAB>
  % ls .mozilla/Adam\ Spiers/
  % ls .mozilla/Adam\ Spiers/<TAB>
  % ls .mozilla/Adam\ Spiers/ 
                              ^
                         cursor is now here

i.e. the final <TAB> inserts a space, despite there being files in the
directory.

Adam
