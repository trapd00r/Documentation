*When* is this going to be sorted out?
I think everyone (who hasn't unsubbed already) would agree that this is
getting rediculous.
It's really not too much to ask for people to be subscribed to a list 
before they can post to it. If people don't want to receive mail from this list
then they can post 3 mails to get help - 1 to sub, 1 query, and then
another to unsub - this is not too out-of-the-ordinary as far as lists go. 
The people who want to continue getting posts from this list are suffering too 
much because of this open policy...

I volunteer to post notification to anyone who wishes to unsub until this gets 
sorted out (as much I'm tempted to unsub myself)... Mail me if you'd
like me to do this.

Dennis.
