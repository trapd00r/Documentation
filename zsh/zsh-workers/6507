Fair enough, having a huge module loaded for simple checking would be
wasteful. I don't actually use the mail-file checking myself though.

I'll start by having a look at MH and see if that will serve my purposes
well. If not I'll have a go at writing something myself (unless someone
else beats me to it). I've got a lot of other things to do before so
don't expect to hear anything more about this from me in for quite a
long time.

My ideas are basically to first have most of the basic functionality of
mailx and mush: listing and displaying a message. In addition there
would be powerful commands for selecting messages (like the mush pick
command) and operating on dynamic folders.
