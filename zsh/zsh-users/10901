Because you've closed it, so it's not available for writing.  Most tools
just assume that file descriptors 0, 1 and 2 are available for use and
will just write to stdout without checking, so they'll get errors and
complain like that when it's closed.

echo as a shell built-in is handling it gracefully, because zsh is
handling what you meant, not what you wrote.  Try it with /bin/echo and
you'll see it fail in the same way as the other commands.

If you want to discard output, redirect it to the bitbucket.
