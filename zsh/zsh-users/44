Hi, I'm a newbie to the the zsh and I'm really
surprised about the features.

What I'm trying to get are the special characters
(umlaute - again this 8 bit stuff :-) in a scoterm.
xterm is working fine so I think it's because of XWindows.
Anyone has experience with this kind of problem?

TIA
-Joachim
