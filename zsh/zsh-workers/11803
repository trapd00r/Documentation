Have any of you with sourceforge logins tried completing `cd /h/g/z'?

It's *minutes* before something comes back, the first time.  Thereafter
the filesystem info is cached (by the linux kernel, not in zsh) and it
goes down to only several seconds. (E.g. if you were to log in and try it
*right now*, it'd be fairly fast, because *I* just waited the minutes for
the FS cache to load.)

Any ideas on optimizing _path_files for directories with LOTS of subdirs?
