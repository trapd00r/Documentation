Yes.

Yes.  What we need is a copy of the repository (complete with
CVSROOT).  cvsup can export that.

Probably negotiable.  If I've got CVS read access to the repository,
then I'd rather people checked patches directly to it (that way
they're more likely to provide meaningful RCS logs, which I'd guess
Tanaka's scripts can't?).

Then the issue is whether the core developers can use CVS over ssh,
and what to do with random people who have patches (even I provided a
tiny one, once, though it's gone long ago).  I'd guess the former is
not a problem, and that the latter can be dealt with using the patch
manager.  

I could be quite wrong, though.  I have the impression that special
things like this can be negotiated; perhaps someone could ask if this
really is desirable.
