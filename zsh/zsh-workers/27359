Too bad the completion is 48KiB in size...

So, here is the patch from my git repository:
<http://ft.bewatermyfriend.org/tmp/0001-Add-completion-for-tmux.patch>

This is the message included in the patch:

There is a new (well, newer than GNU screen) terminal multiplexer
available from: <http://tmux.sourceforge.net>

Here's a completion for it, I've been working on for the past week.

It includes completions for every subcommand. However, I didn't test it
too heavily yet. So, I might have gotten one or the other thing wrong (I
hope not too many, though).

_tmux requires tmux version 1.1 (released yesterday) for every subcommand
completion to work properly.

Regards, Frank
