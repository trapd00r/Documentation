Try

zsh% mkdir -p ~/.zsh/urls/bookmark/list
zsh% echo http://www.zsh.org/mla/ > ~/.zsh/urls/bookmark/list/zsh
zsh% lynx bookmark:list/zsh<TAB>
->
zsh% lynx http://www.zsh.org/mla/

This is zsh level bookmark implementation and not browser specific.

Sounds good.

I think _urls should complete only URLs by default.  And its default
behaviour may be useful for web grabbers such as wget, htget, GET,
HEAD, curl, etc.  There is _wget for wget, though.
