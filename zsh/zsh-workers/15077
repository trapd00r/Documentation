Subject: 4.0.2 imminent
Date: Mon, 25 Jun 2001 18:03:43 +0100
From: Peter Stephenson <pws@csr.com>

I'm about to release 4.0.2 --- in fact, I would have bundled it up if a
whole load of tools hadn't suddenly disappeared from sourceforge including
gcc.

Anyway, now is the chance to do some last minute testing before I do
release it.  The version number change is already committed, but I haven't
yet tagged it.  The tests all pass on various versions of Linux and
Solaris.

Note it will be configured using autoconf 2.13 for consistency, although
2.50 is supported if you are building from scratch.  I plan to use 2.50 for
public versions starting with development releases of 4.1 (there will
probably be one of those soon).
