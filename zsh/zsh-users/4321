} 	??? Why not, given that that's what I'm having problems
} with?

Because `compctl -g' forces a glob to happen.  Glob completion (as in the
glob_complete option) only determines how completion proceeds when there
is a partial match.

Well, for one thing, you ought to try running a newer version than
3.1.9.

But what I meant was, for example, tell us what your setopts actually
are rather than ask us what they might not be, tell us in which version
of zsh these same compctls last worked if they ever did, what happens
if you run `zsh -f' and then add the suspicious compctls one at a time,
anything else that might have changed recently (are you using both the
compctl and the new systems?) etc.
