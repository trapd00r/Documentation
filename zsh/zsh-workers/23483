Hi,
since 16. May 2007 zsh/Config/installfns.sh uses $INSTALL_PROGRAM (Version 
1.10.2.1), but the command with its call in zsh/Makefile.in (Version 1.13, 
lines 83ff) does not fill the environment with INSTALL_PROGRAM, only with 
INSTALL_DATA and some other variables. Because of this, (some?) to be 
installed programs do not get installed but called.

Regards Andreas
