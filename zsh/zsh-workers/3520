:The arithmetic for command seems to be broken in 3.0.5-test2:
:   integer i
:   for (( i=1; i <= 10; i+=1 ))
:   do 
:     print $i
:   done
:This gives:

That's implemented in 3.1.2 not 3.0.* , and the manuals of each reflect this.
ie. it's listed in 3.1.2 manuals but not in 3.0.* manuals
It may be in 3.1.1 but out of the 29 versions of zsh I've got in my bin dir
it seems to be missing so I can't really tell you at the moment, sorry.
