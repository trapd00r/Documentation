Hi.

Consider a directory hierarchy that looks like this

abc/ghi/jkl
def/ghi/mno

Now consider that you've just typed this:

    Z% ls */g

and now you hit Tab.  You get a beep and nothing happens to the 
command line.  I  think it would be reasonable and useful to get this

    Z% ls */ghi/

Thanks

Dave
