I agree this is an extra feature, but it's not limited to Linux.  The
patched ls works fine on any unix machine (it's a patch to the GNU
fileutils) and produces colour on any terminal that supports ANSI
colour control sequences (or non-ANSI, for that matter; it's absurdly
configurable).

To make things more flexible (and to make life easier for zsh
maintainers), what about a function that gets called on filenames that
are to be printed in completion tables?  A default one could add a * to
executable files, a / to directories and so on, but other functions
could be substituted.  (There's a problem with formatting here; perhaps
it could be punted by giving the optional function the list of
completions, and let it decide how to format them?)

That would do.
