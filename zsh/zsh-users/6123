Subject: Completion function for bitkeeper?

Before I go about trying to potentially re-invent someone's wheel, I
thought it would be prudent to ask:

Has anyone already written a completion function for bitkeeper with
similar level of sophistication as the cvs helper?


Now back to your previously interrupted daily dosage of SPAM...
