Thats what i had originally thought .. but *C*f* would also produce the
completion on _tar_archive  and not _file -/ (which would be my expected
behavior from the -C switch). Anyhow thanks for your reply .. as i'd
mentioned in my previous i've only been using zsh for a short while ..
i can't tell you how great i'm finding it .. i'm hooked! kudos to all
involved.

I'm planning writting a basic intro (that would only cover 3.1.9 as that
is all i'm familiar with) would that seem too premature, meaning is it
safe to assume that 4.x (or what ever the next stable release it to be)
is on the horizon?
