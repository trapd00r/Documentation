I've found a more serious problem with this.

% export ZMLIB=$PWD               # some people probably have this set anyway
% setopt noautomenu menucomplete noautolist
% echo $Z<TAB>            -> $ZMLIST/
         <TAB>            -> $ZSH_NAME
         <TAB>            -> $ZSH_VERSION
         <RET>            -> $ZSH_VERSIO

It seems to lose memory of the fact that the slash has already gone.
