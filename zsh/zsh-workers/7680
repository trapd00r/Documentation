There's no () after _perldoc, so it thinks it's a function call, not a
definition.  You just generate hundreds of recursive calls to _perldoc
until the machine gets board of having enough space on the stack, or
something.

Also, since it's assumed in the completion functions that KSH_AUTOLOAD
isn't set, you need to have as the last line `_perldoc "$@"' to call
the function you've just defined.

The may be a bug here.  Has anyone the slightest idea why `_perldoc {'
is accepted as a complete command line with the argument "{"?
