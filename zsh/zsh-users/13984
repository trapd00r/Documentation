} Are such extras typically left in?

They're split up the way they are so that if necessary the unused ones
can be discarded, but as they're all loaded only on demand anyway, it
really doesn't make much difference if they're present unless you're
on an underpowered system where searching the directories slows down
command execution in a noticeable way.

It's probably safe to say that they're "typically left in" just because
they're part of the standard distribution and most packagers don't drop
bits and pieces when they redistribute.
