During the substitution the $_ special parameter expands to the name of the
mail folder.  The old value of $_ is saved before the expansion and
restored afterwards.  In command substitutions only the first command can
use $_ this way but that is not a big limitation.  Command substitutions
are evaluated after a fork() and the change in $_ does not affect the
parent process.
