Hi.

This is a bug that is easy to reproduce:
------------snip---------
% cat > Makefile
all:
	@echo hello
^D
% make
hello
% make foo().
% make
make:.:3: not enough arguments
% make all
make:.:4: not enough arguments

------------snip---------
That's it. Now, make is screwed.
This behaviour doesn't show in bash or sh.


Cheers,

Adrien.
