What's this doing in Doc/Makefile[.in]?

DVIPS = dvips -D 300

Eh?  Why has someone assumed my 360/720dpi, cartridge-hungry Epson is 300
dpi?  I can't see a good reason for having this here at all.  I *can* see a
good reason for having `dvips -o ...' in case output goes by default to the
printer, whatever its resolution.

I'm going back to my Deskjet compatible...
