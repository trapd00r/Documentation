I've uploaded 4.3.4-dev-8 to

ftp://ftp.zsh.org/pub/development/zsh-4.3.4-dev-8.tar.gz
ftp://ftp.zsh.org/pub/development/zsh-4.3.4-dev-8-doc.tar.gz

If there are no new disasters I will release this as 4.3.5 in a couple
of days.

If you get a chance to look at the documentation let me know if there is
anything obviously broken there.  I'm getting a warning about the
texinfo node "User Configuration Functions" from pdftex which doesn't
seem to make sense.
