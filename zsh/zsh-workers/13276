:Here is my proposal.  The following patch modifies :r, :e, :h,

:     view) 

?  I don't expect :r to behave that way but I don't really use it
much these days so maybe my objections have little weight.

: item(tt(r))(
:-Remove a trailing suffix of the form `tt(.)var(xxx)', leaving the basename.
:+Remove a filename extension of the form `tt(.)var(xxx)', leaving
:+the root name.
: )

I'm not sure the wording has cleared it up.  The previous wording of
"trailing suffix" [what's a non-trailing suffix? :-)] wasn't that
good but what's the "root name"?  (Can't think of anything better
at the moment, sorry).
