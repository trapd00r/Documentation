What platform is this?  (Linux, but can you be more specific?  Is it
multiprocessor or otherwise using an SMP kernel?)

Unless your config.h defines BROKEN_POSIX_SIGSUSPEND, there's only
one call to pause() in the sources, in signal_suspend().

I can't see any recent changes that would be even remotely related to
this, except for zsh-workers/21391, and that's from more than one
snapshot ago.
