Man, I hate getting this far behind.

} I like this -- it makes writing an up-line-or-local-history function
} much simpler.

Way back in zsh-workers/4103 I griped:

    ... right now it's completely impossible for a user-defined
    widget to initiate a history search; "zle history-search-backward"
    just causes the shell to prompt the user for input, but the
    widget may already have a string it wants to search for.
    "history-search-backward string" is the natural way to perform
    that action.

If we're implementing this, why are we limiting it to *numeric* arguments?
