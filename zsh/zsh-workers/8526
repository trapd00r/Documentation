Can I first suggest that we spell out "priorities"? It's not like it's
going to be typed very often, is it?

I'm also never sure what to expect from "sorted by priority."  In this
case a smaller number is a higher priority, right?  But a negative
number is treated as bigger than any positive one?  That's a bit weird.
Or am I misunderstanding?

} The need to declare `prios' and `tags' as locals is very ugly, but
} currently I don't see a really satisfying solution.

I've been thinking about something for that, but so far it's too nebulous
to tell if it's going to work.

}   comptag option+='*dvi*=1'
} 
}     the `+=' means that the definition is prepended to the already
}     existing definition

Hrm.  I would have expected += to *append* rather than *prepend* (my
C++ is showing).

Otherwise, this looks pretty good.

Perhaps more on the other questions later; I have a cramp in my neck this
morning which is making it difficult to type.
