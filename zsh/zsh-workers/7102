From: Peter Stephenson <pws@ibmth.df.unipi.it>

Just trying compset -q to enhance completion for *sh -c:

  The word
  currently being completed is split in separate words at the spaces. The 
  resulting words are stored in the tt(words) array, and tt(PREFIX),
  tt(SUFFIX), tt(QIPREFIX), and tt(QISUFFIX) are modified to reflect the 
  word part that is completed.

What doesn't seem to get updated is CURRENT, which for consistency ought to
point into the $words array as modified.
