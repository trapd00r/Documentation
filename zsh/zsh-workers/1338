Is there a way to go one menu-completion backward? E.g. if I set
automenu (or menucomplete), pressing TAB once expands as much as
possible, whereas each TAB afterwards will cycle through the possible
completions. I would like to have a binding (e.g. bound to M-TAB,
which is now unused) to cycle backwards. Is there such a binding
already?

jagor$ cat 
           ^ pressing TAB here I cycle through the directory one-way
             only. Can I get the other way?

I know this can also be achieved by pressing C-_ (undo), but it
doesn't work well when I press TAB again, since it will no longer
cycle, it just accepts the completion at point.

jagor$ cat watch.c
                  ^ After pressing TAB a couple of times, I have
                    reached watch.c. I can cycle backwards using
                    C-_, but cycling forward again doesn't work.
