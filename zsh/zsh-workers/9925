Subject: Shutting up a silly compiler warning
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Jos Backus just reported this one to me, from the FreeBSD compiler:

utils.o: In function `gettempname':
utils.o(.text+0x1bfa): warning: mktemp() possibly used unsafely; consider
using mkstemp()

Zsh does NOT use mktemp() unsafely, and it can't use mkstemp() because it
sometimes wants to create a FIFO or other non-plain-file.  What's the way
to get rid of this warning without actually changing the code?
