    Not at all: I was wrong. I misinterpreted you and thought you
want to *get rid of* the globbing pattern (nullglob), and not ignore
the fail (nomatch). Peter has helped you in other message, though.

    I don't know, I don't use the default zsh completion system. But
someone in the list will help you, sure :) Anyway, I suspect that
there isn't such metacharacter...
