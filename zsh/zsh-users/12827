Hi,

I am using root-tail to display log file messages on my X window
background. This program accepts several file arguments which each can
be configured with a different color. It could be nice to also follow
remote log files, but root-tail only accepts file arguments.

How could I convert a "ssh root@server tail -F /var/log/syslog" command 
into a _live_ local file that I could then pass as argument to 
root-tail? Can zsh do that?

I tried using "=(ssh root@server tail -F /var/log/syslog)" but nothing 
is displayed.

Thanks,
