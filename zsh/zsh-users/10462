*hangs head in shame* It has been my full-time IRC client as well since
I announced it on the list.  Pathetic, I know, but it is pretty cool.
Anyway, if you don't mind (and I'm guessing you don't since you posted
your changes to a GPL program), I'll incorporate your changes into zIRC
and it is looking like I should probably put up some sort of repository
for the thing because I have been working on it quite a bit as well. :)

Ok, anonymous access (subversion):

svn co svn://svn.aeruder.net/svn/zirc/trunk

The most notable change I've finished is auto-quoting for zirc commands.
It is quite similar to how the url-magic-quote plugin works and makes
the thing a heck of a lot more usable, IMO.

For anyone else interested, I've setup a small website at

http://www.aeruder.net/software/ZIRC.html

where I'll eventually post the newer versions (what is there is what I
sent the mailing list still).

I'll get around to incorporating your changes whenever I can figure out
the diff since your editor totally destroyed all the whitespace
settings.

Have fun,
Andy
