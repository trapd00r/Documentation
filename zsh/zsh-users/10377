Hi list,

I am pretty new to zsh, using it for login shells now for about a month.=20
My question may be simple.

I have a command sequence which works as expected when bash is the=20
default shell (/bin/sh) but which fails to capture stderr output when=20
/bin/sh points to zsh. Can someone tell me why, and better yet how to=20
find the missing stderr messages? The sequence is:

{ ./configure && make && make install } &> log &

When run under bash, all three tasks are backgrounded, and all output is=20
sent to log. Under zsh, all three tasks are backgrounded, but only=20
stdout goes to log. stderr output vanishes somewhere.=20

Details: zsh 4.3.2 (i686-pc-linux-gnu)
Linux hq 2.6.16 #2 PREEMPT Mon Jun 12 10:37:27 EDT 2006 i686 GNU/Linux
Distro is Debian unstable.

Any insights appreciated.

Chuck
