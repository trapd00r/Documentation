Subject: PATCH: getopts fails on empty string
Date: Thu, 01 Aug 2002 16:43:42 +0100
Message-ID: <24771.1028216622@csr.com>
From: Peter Stephenson <pws@csr.com>

We used to have new getopts bugs turning up just about every
week... this is just like old times.  We really need a test.

If getopts encounters an empty string on the command line, it will
ignore the argument and go on to the next one.  Typically this means
$OPTIND is one too large, but if the next word looks like an option
other things could happen.

By the way, I've committed Dan's xtrace patch.
