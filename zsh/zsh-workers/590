I'm one of the fools who aliases rm to 'rm -i' and who has zsh prompt
on *. (I know the argument that I'll be burned when I do an rm * on
another system and expect to be protected. But until then I'll just
attend `rm -i anonymous meetings' ;-)

Anyway, should zsh behave this way under these circumstances:

	$ rm *
	zsh: sure you want to delete all the files in /foo/bar? n
	rm: too few arguments
	Try `rm --help' for more information.

(this is gnu rm, obviously)

I'd thought the command itself would be aborted, but instead it
appears to just clean out the arg list for the command. Is this the
intended behaviour?
