    Hi Oliver :)

    Just to make sure I've understood, if I want to make it work with
absolute and relative pathnames (I'll get into variable expansions
after that), I should do something like:

    compset -P '*/'
    PREPATH="$PWD/"
    [[ $IPREFIX[1] == "/" ]] && {
        IPPREFIX=${IPPREFIX#/}
        PREPATH="/"
    }
    compadd -W $PREPATH$IPREFIX -f - ${IPREFIX}*(:t)

    Quick'n'dirty hack, but it should work, shouldn't it?

    Thanks again, Oliver :)
