} Right. This makes it configurable with the special-dirs style. Can
} anyone think of a better name?

I'm dubious that '.' should ever be a completion by itself.  I really don't
want to type `.<TAB>' and end up with `./' on the line -- but I can see the
argument for wanting `..<TAB>' to behave that way.  Yes, it's exactly the
same number of keystrokes to type the slash yourself instead of a tab, but
habits are habits.

Completing '.' would be even more annoying with REC_EXACT.
