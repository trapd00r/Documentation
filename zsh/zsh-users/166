Zsh know the extra features that sh scripts under Linux tends to use.  I thing
these are mostly the ${...%...} type substitutions.  I think that this
substitution syntax is part of the POSIX shell specification.  If one wants to
use a lightweight replacement for bash she may also try pdksh which tries to
be posix conformant and know almost everything that bash knows and it is even
faster than that.
