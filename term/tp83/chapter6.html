<H1 CLASS="chapterhead">VT101, VT102 and VT131 Video Terminals</H1>
<H2>Overview</H2>
<P>The success of the VT100 video terminal led to the development of three additional
terminals that offer full VT100 functionality plus additional features.</P>
<H3>VT101</H3>
<P>Digital's VT101 terminal is designed for the price sensitive customer. If you want all
the capabilities of the VT100 but do not require expandability for your application, then
the VT101 may be the terminal for you. The VT101's basic functionality is the same as that
of the VT100 without options. The VT101 video terminal is totally self-contained, with no
functional upgrade options.</P>
<P>The general purpose VT101 terminal can be used in a variety of applications &#8211;
commercial, educational, and industrial, as well as for small businesses. It includes
selectable local echo that allows the VT101 terminal to be used connected to non-Digital
computer systems. It does not accept any options except for the 20&nbsp;mA adapter, which
allows for connection of the terminal in remote applications.</P>
<P>The following models of the VT101 video terminal are available.</P>

<P>Digital's VT102 terminal gives you enhanced VT100 functionality. Like the VT101, the
VT102 is a low-cost product and incorporates the most popular VT100 options &#8211; the
advanced video option and the serial printer port &#8211; in its base design. The advanced
video option provide three capabilities.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Any combination of bold, blink, reverse video, and underline, that highlights on a
per-character basis.</LI>
<LI>Space and connectors for an alternate character set that allows you to have additional
character sets resident in the terminal.</LI>
<LI>Extra screen memory to support 132 column-by-24-line displays.</LI>
</UL>
<P>The serial RS-232 printer port enables you to connect a printing terminal so you can
generate a hardcopy printout of your screen's contents.</P>
<P>The VT102 supports the ability to insert or delete characters and lines of characters
at the cursor position. The VT102 also supports insert and replace modes for adding
characters. Insert mode displays the newly-added characters and moves previously displayed
characters to the right. Replace mode adds characters by replacing the character currently
at the cursor position.</P>
<P>A nonexpandable, general-purpose video terminal that can be used in commercial,
educational, and industrial applications, the VT102 has built into it special
communication-oriented features. These include modem support and true half-duplex
communication protocols, as well as selectable local echo.</P>
<P>With the VT102 terminal, you can even select a model with a word processing
keyboard.</P>

<H3>VT131</H3>
<TABLE WIDTH="100%">
<CAPTION>The VT131 has the advantage of two modes of transmission &#8211; conversational or
block mode.</CAPTION>

</TBODY>
</TABLE>
<P>The VT131 gives you the most popular VT100 options built into the terminal &#8211;
advanced video and printer port. In addition, the VT131 has the advantage of two modes of
transmission, conversational or block mode. The block mode environment lets you locally
edit data before transmitting it to the host.</P>
<P>Designed for a variety of data entry applications, the nonupgradeable, block mode VT131
video terminal provides:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Conversational or local/edit block mode transmission</LI>
<LI>Protected fields</LI>
<LI>Data compression</LI>
<LI>Selectable local echo</LI>
<LI>Built-in advanced video</LI>
<LI>Built-in printer port</LI>
<LI>VT100 and VT102 compatible character transmission</LI>
<LI>U.S./European half- and full-duplex communications and modem control</LI>
</UL>
<P>The local edit capability of the VT131 terminal allows you to enter and locally edit a
full screen of data before transmitting the data as a block to the host. Local editing
also reduces the amount of time the CPU spends processing data entry, since many editing
features are built into the terminal, and need not be in your application program. The
editing functions of the VT131 terminal include insert/delete character or line, active
cursor controls, and forward/back tab. With block mode transmission, the host does not
receive data on a character-by-character basis with each character requiring editing. This
block mode feature allows the VT131 to be used on non-Digital systems where block mode
transmission is required.</P>
<P>Protected fields prevent certain areas of the screen from being modified by data entry
from the keyboard. This is valuable for forms applications. Data compression allows for
selectable transmission of all or just unprotected data. This reduces the amount of data
transmitted in a forms application.</P>
<P>Digital currently supports the VT131's block mode transmission under VAX/VMS version
3.0 only. Support is at the operating system level, and this requires the use of
third-party applications programs to take full advantage of the VT131's features. This
allows Digital software OEMs that use block mode terminals to use their software on
Digital hardware with minimal modification. Digital has no plans to provide application
software for the VT131 in other than VT102 (conversational) mode.</P>
<P>Other than VMS, Digital operating systems are optimized for conversational entry, and
thus require careful use or modification in order to efficiently handle a number of
VT131s. Modification may include expanding the buffer size of the terminal handler,
changing the interrupt routines, etc. The exact modifications are application and system
dependent and should only be attempted by those customers who possess operating system
expertise. Modification of the operating system is <EM>not</EM> supported by Digital.</P>
<P>Digital offers the following models of the VT131.</P>

<H2>Controls and Indicators</H2>
<P>The VT101, VT102, and VT131 terminals have the same monitor, keyboard, and audible and
visual controls as the other members of the VT100 family. See
<A HREF="chapter5.html">Chapter 5</A> or the <CITE>VT101</CITE>, <CITE>VT102</CITE>, or
<CITE>VT131 User Guides</CITE> for more information.</P>
<P>However, some indicator LEDs have been assigned for specific applications in the VT102
and VT131 terminals.</P>

</TR>
</TBODY>
</TABLE>
<H3>CTS Indicator</H3>
<P>This is found in the VT102 and VT131 terminals. It shows the on and off position of the
Clear to Send or Secondary Clear to Send modem connector signals. The internal
communication switches of the terminal determine the connector signal used to turn on and
off the CTS indicator. The on condition means that characters can be transmitted by the
terminal.</P>
<H3>DSR Indicator</H3>
<P>This is found in the VT102 and VT131 terminals. It shows the condition of the Data Set
Ready modem connector signal. The on and off condition of the Data Set Ready signal turns
the indicator on and off. The on condition means that the Data Set is ready to transmit
and receive characters. <STRONG>Note:</STRONG> When the 20&nbsp;mA current loop option is
installed, the DSR signal is not used.</P>
<H3>Insert Indicator</H3>
<P>This is found in the VT102 and VT131 terminals. It shows when the terminal is in insert
or replace mode. When the terminal is in insert mode, the INSERT indicator is on. The
terminal inserts characters at the cursor position, moving all previously displayed
characters to the right. Characters moved past the right margin are lost. When the
terminal is in replace mode, characters are added by writing over previously displayed
characters at the cursor position.</P>
<H3>Edit Indicator</H3>
<P>This is found on the VT131 terminal and shows when the terminal is in edit or
interactive mode. When the terminal is in edit mode, the indicator is on. Characters typed
on the keyboard are displayed on the screen. The characters on the screen are edited
before they are transmitted to the host. When the terminal is in interactive mode, the
indicator is off. The terminal immediately transmits each character when typed.</P>
<H2>Operator Features</H2>
<P>All VT100 family members incorporate features that can be selected in set-up.
Set-up features determine how the terminal operates. They allow the terminal to be
configured according to your preference, and provide compatibility to the host and AC
power source. Unlike some terminals, the VT100 family does not use switches or jumpers to
individually turn the built-in features on or off. Instead, they use a nonvolatile memory
(NVR) that always remembers what features have been selected, just as if a switch had been
set.</P>
<H3>Set-Up</H3>
<P>Set-Up mode provides two, or in the case of the VT131, three brief descriptions of the
current feature status. Set-Up A displays the location of the tab stops set in the
terminal and a visual ruler which numbers each character position on the line. The status
of other terminal features is summarized in Set-Up B.</P>
<P>See <A HREF="chapter5.html">Chapter 5</A> for details on entering Set-Up A.</P>
<P>As described in <A HREF="chapter5.html">Chapter 5</A>, Set-Up B mode only can be
entered from Set-Up A Mode. Because the VT101, VT102, and VT131 terminals have features
different from a regular VT100 terminal, Set-Up B has additional features for you to
select.</P>
<P>In addition to all the Set-Up B features described in <A HREF="chapter5.html">Chapter
5</A> for the VT100 family, the VT101, VT102, and VT131 have some additional set-up
choices.</P>

<H4>WPS Terminal</H4>
<P>This feature exchanges the position of the linefeed and the backslash key.
<STRONG>Note:</STRONG> Only on VT102 and VT131.</P>
<H4>Local Echo</H4>
<P>Most computers echo back characters as they are received, but some do not. If the host
does not echo characters, the local echo feature can be selected so that the terminal
prints each character as it is typed. If the host computer does echo each character, the
local echo feature can be disabled. <STRONG>Note:</STRONG> Only on VT101, VT102, and
VT131.</P>
<H4>Print Term Char</H4>
<P>The print termination character feature determines if a form feed (FF) control
character is transmitted to the printer after a print screen operation. When the print
termination character is selected as a form feed, a form feed character is transmitted to
the printer after the screen is printed. <STRONG>Note:</STRONG> Only on VT102 and
VT131.</P>
<H4>Print Extent</H4>
<P>This feature determines which characters on the screen are printed during a screen
operation. When this feature is set for full screen, all characters on the screen are
printed. When the feature is set for scrolling region, only the characters located in the
scrolling region are printed. <STRONG>Note:</STRONG> Only on VT102 and VT131.</P>
<H4>Stop Bits</H4>
<P>Selects the use of one or two bits by the modem interface. This feature does not
determine the number of stop bits used by the printer interface. <STRONG>Note:</STRONG>
Only on VT102 and VT131.</P>
<H4>Auto Answerback Enable</H4>
<P>This lets the terminal automatically transmit the answerback message when a connection
is made to the computer. When using half-duplex communication with the initial direction
feature selected to receive, the answerback message is not transmitted until the terminal
is able to transmit, once it is no longer receiving data. This feature does not affect the
transmission of the answerback message. <STRONG>Note:</STRONG> Only on VT102 and
VT131.</P>
<H4>Disc Delay</H4>
<P>The disconnect delay feature is only used when the modem control set-up feature is set
to full-duplex with modem control. It determines the time allowed before the terminal
disconnects from the communication line when the receive line signal detection is list.
<STRONG>Note:</STRONG> Only on VT102 and VT131.</P>
<H4>Disconnect Char Enable</H4>
<P>The disconnect character enable feature determines if the terminal disconnects from
the communications line when the disconnect character is received. When this feature is
on, the terminal disconnects when the disconnect character is received. Also, the terminal
automatically transmits the disconnect character when the SHIFT and BREAK key sequence is
used. The disconnect character is usually the end of transmission (EOT) control
character. <STRONG>Note:</STRONG> Only on VT102 and VT131.</P>
<H4>Break Enable</H4>
<P>The break enable feature determines if a break signal is transmitted when the BREAK key
is pressed. If this feature is on, pressing the BREAK key causes the break signal to be
transmitted. If the feature is off, the BREAK key does not function when pressed alone.
However, all other sequences that use the BREAK key are not affected.
<STRONG>Note:</STRONG> Only on VT102 and VT131.</P>
<H4>Initial Direction</H4>
<P>This is only used when the modem control set-up is selected at half-duplex. This
feature checks to determine if the terminal begins half-duplex communication by receiving
or transmitting characters. <STRONG>Note:</STRONG> Only on VT102 and VT131.</P>

<H4>Auto Turnaround</H4>
<P>This is only used when the modem control set-up is selected at half-duplex coded
control. Auto turnaround causes the turnaround character to be transmitted automatically.
This character is automatically transmitted after the characters transmitted by the RETURN
key and the end of the answerback message. <STRONG>Note:</STRONG> Only on VT102 and
VT131.</P>
<H4>Modem</H4>
<P>Both the VT102 and the VT131 feature modem control. Modem control signals are used to
ensure that a connection exists between the terminal and computer before and during
communication. If the connection does not exist, communication is not permitted. This
selection is used when communicating with a computer through a full-duplex modem that uses
modem control signals. These two terminals also offer asymmetric full-duplex that is
full-duplex communication using a half-duplex modem with a secondary channel. The
secondary channel of the half-duplex modem provides full-duplex communication by allowing
the terminal to transmit characters on the secondary channel. <STRONG>Note:</STRONG> Only
on VT102 and VT131.</P>
<H4>Printer Data/Parity Bits</H4>
<P>The printer data/parity bits feature defines two separate but related communications
features &#8211; data bits per character and parity &#8211; when communicating with the
printer. Data bits per character defines the number of data bits of the transmit and
receive characters, seven or eight bits. When eight bits is selected, however, the
eighth bit is set to space or zero for characters transmitted. The eighth bit of received
characters is ignored.</P>
<P>Parity defines the type of parity bit the terminal generates when transmitting
characters, and checks when receiving characters. If no parity is selected, the parity
bit is not included in the transmitted character and is ignored in received characters.
<STRONG>Note:</STRONG> Only on VT102 and VT131.</P>
<H3>Default Mode</H3>
<P>Default settings can be recalled by pressing SHIFT and D while in set-up mode. This
feature is available on the VT101, VT102, and VT131 terminals.</P>
<H2>Programming Information</H2>
<P>Escape and control sequences create functions not provided by standard control
characters of the character set. These sequences are multiple character control functions
that are not displayed but determine terminal operation. Escape and control sequences are
defined by ANSI X3.41-1977 and X3.64-1979. Refer to <A HREF="appendixc.html">Appendix
C</A> for more information about sequences and sequence formats or consult the
<CITE>User Guide</CITE> for your terminal model.</P>
<H2>Maintenance</H2>
<P>The VT101, VT102, and VT131 terminals are designed to be easy to maintain. No
preventative maintenance is required. They have built-in, self-test diagnostics that
greatly reduce the time necessary to isolate and repair faults. These terminals also
feature automatic self-tests that are run every time they are powered up. The use of pop
fasteners instead of screw fasteners reduces the time and cost of repairs by providing
easy access to all components. Should a repair become necessary, Digital Field Service is
available worldwide.</P>
<P>The VT100 family has proven to be an exceptionally reliable series of terminals. There
are just two mechanical switches &#8211; one for turning the terminal on, and one for
selecting the power supply voltage. All other functions, such as baud rates, tabs, parity,
etc., are set via the keyboard and stored in the nonvolatile memory. The elimination of
mechanical switches aids the use of diagnostics for testing the terminal functions
and adapting to varying environments under host control.</P>
<H3>Self-Test</H3>
<P>Automatic self-test modes are built into the VT101, VT102, and VT131 terminals.</P>
<H4>VT101 Self-Tests</H4>
<P>The VT101 uses two self-tests to verify proper operation: a power-up self-test and a
data loopback self-test. The power-up self-test is performed each time the terminal is
powered up. The data loopback self-test is performed after the power-up test is
successfully completed. To run the data loopback self-test, the terminal must be
disconnected from the communication line and an external loopback connector must be
installed. See your <CITE>VT101 User Guide</CITE> for further details.</P>
<H4>VT102 Self-Tests</H4>
<P>In addition to the same power-up and data loopback self-tests performed by the VT101
terminal, the VT102 terminal runs an EIA loopback self-test and a printer loopback
self-test.</P>
<P>The EIA loopback self-test verifies that the VT102 terminal can operate its modem
control lines. The printer loopback self-test checks that the VT102 terminal printer
interface can transmit and receive characters. In the printer loopback test, the transmit
and receive lines are connected to each other with an external loopback connector. The
terminal transmits characters on the transmit line and receives the characters on the
receive line. Details on test procedures are in the <CITE>VT102 User Guide</CITE>.</P>
<H4>VT131 Self-Tests</H4>
<P>The VT131 terminal performs the same self-tests &#8211; power-up, data loopback, EIA
loopback, and printer loopback &#8211; as the VT101 and VT102 terminals. It also runs a
printer self-test and verifies that the terminal and the printer can communicate. This
test generates sample data for printing and transmits this data to the printer. Check
your <CITE>VT131 User Guide</CITE> for details.</P>
<H3>Operator Troubleshooting Checklist</H3>
<P>If it appears that there is a problem in the terminal, initiate the power-up self-test
program. This test will help to determine if the problem lies in your terminal or in some
other part of the computer system.</P>
