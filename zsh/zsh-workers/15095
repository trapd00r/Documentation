Fine, but we will have to expose the ZLE_KILL flag so we know whether to
overwrite or add to the existing buffer when user commands are mixed with
internal kills.  This problem is why (some time ago) Zefram was trying to
decrease dependence on internal flags.  The only other way is a different
way of communicating this and other pieces of state information.

Of course, we can do it completely separately, but then you're forced to
replace all the internal kill commands with functions, which seems to me a
bit much to force on people.

We also need to decide how to rotate the kill ring if it's presented as an
array.
