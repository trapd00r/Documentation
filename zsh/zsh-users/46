Hi,

I want to set up the compctl so that vi args complete only files
which are not directories and are not files that end in .bak.

I got as far as 

ls *(^/) 

which lists everything not a directory

and 

ls ^bak

which lists every file not ending in bak

but I can't figure how to AND these two patterns together.

thanks.
