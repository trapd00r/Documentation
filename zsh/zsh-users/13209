For reasons buried in history that I don't understand, the <(...) is
parsed as a single complete argument.  It's somewhat laconically
documented that they are "command arguments" and not parts of an
argument.  This may just have been laziness.

You can use a front end function:

mycommand_file() {
  mycommand -file=$1 "${(@)argv[2,-1]}"
}
mycommand_file <(...)
