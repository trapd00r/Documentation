Yes, you're right, I had not made the test myself as I expected
it to work the same as in any other shell.

echo foo[

works OK in every shell but zsh.

If you've got a command named foo[, though, 

foo[ bar

doesn't work with ksh or bash (because, they take it as the
start of an array subscript assignment). It's OK with pdksh,
though.

Is there any reason why

echo [
works and not
echo foo[

in zsh?
