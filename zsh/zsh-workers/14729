It says that the shell is to do field splitting after parameter
expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion,
provided double quotes are not involved.  More or less.

I'm not sure that that clears things up, since I interpret
the meaning of `word' in ${x:=word}, x=word, and export x=word
to be the pre-expanded word.
