How compatible with shell is it?

bor@itsrm2:~%> foo=bar
bor@itsrm2:~%> print $"foo"
$foo
bor@itsrm2:~%> print ${"foo"}
bar
bor@itsrm2:~%> print ${"bar":-com}

but

bor@itsrm2:~%> /sbin/xpg4/sh (for what it's worth :-)
$ foo=bar
$ print $"foo"
$foo
$ print ${"foo"}
/sbin/xpg4/sh: ${"foo"}: bad substitution
$ print ${"bar":-com}
/sbin/xpg4/sh: ${"bar":-com}: bad substitution
