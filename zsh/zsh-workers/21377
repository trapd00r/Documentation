} Adding the parens makes it do the right thing in this particular case.

I'm concerned that the parens will be confused for a glob qualifier if
there is only one possible match.  If that doesn't happen, then this

I would have expected _path_files to do the right thing, so maybe the fix
is somewhere there.  Or might it be _wanted ...?
