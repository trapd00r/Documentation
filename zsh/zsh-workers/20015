Ah.  I was looking at the sections in the wrong order, so I thought
there was one missing.  It's 4.2, unless you look at zsh.html, which
isn't usually linked to.  That *does* have a version number, and it's
4.0.3.

Yes, indeed.  It would be more useful information to have than
`generated by ... on ...', but I don't think you can change that.
I don't think texi2html is converting the front matter at all.
