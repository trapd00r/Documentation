Also documentation for gettext rather advices against using it and suggests=
=20
using explicit gettext & Co. calls instead:

   The security holes of `$"..."' come from the fact that after looking
up the translation of the string, `bash' processes it like it processes
any double-quoted string: dollar and backquote processing, like `eval'
does.

With obvious implications.

Of course one possibility could be to make result fully quoted and immune t=
o=20
any further processing. OTOH it probably still breaks in nested evals.
