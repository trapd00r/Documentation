The folks around here use rpm even under Solaris...

For one, the update thing Thomas mentioned. And then people may have
different paths, the net may be heterogeneous...

The function moving will happen quite shortly before 4.0, I think. And 
since I even added the BSD stuff, I think everyone should just go
ahead and add system specific completions like these (all functions
they think are fit to be exposed, that is). It might help us  to find
the best way for the final ordering, actually. I hope.
