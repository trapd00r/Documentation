Subject: Nits in compinstall in -dev-22
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Patch below for a typo.

The other nit is not exactly with compinstall, but shows up there.  One
of the explanatory texts reads:

 Completions defined by the new completion system (the one you are
 configuring) always take precedence over the old sort defined with compctl.
 You can choose whether or not you want to search for a compctl-defined
 completion if no new completion was found for a command.  The default
 behaviour is only to check for compctl-defined completions if the required
 library, zsh/compctl, is already loaded.  (If not, this implies that
 compctl has not been called.)  Do you want to test for compctl-defined
 completions?

As of -dev-18 (9591), the compctl module is loaded anytime zle is.  That's
so that brand-new users, who have never run compinstall or compinit, have
some default completions.  One must explicitly unload it to get rid of it.
Perhaps compinstall should offer to unload it?

 To have different values for approximation and correction, you should
 change the context appropriately.  For approximation, use
-\`:completion:*:approxima2te:*' and for correction use
+\`:completion:*:approximate:*' and for correction use
 \`:completion:*:correct:*'.
