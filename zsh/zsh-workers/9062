If it's going to suspend anything, it should be the `.'.  It's NOT
equivalent to command-line input, because zsh doesn't deal with infinite
typeahead.  It's closest to executing a shell function, with no local
parameter context.

However, we certainly don't want startup rc-files to get backgrounded
if one of them happens to do something that gives the user time to press
^Z.  And I can see an argument for wanting to be able to suspend an
individual command without interrupting startup processing entirely.
And it definitely doesn't make any sense to background *that*.

It's a tricky situation.  The only useful criteria seems to me to be
whether the user can reasonably expect to get back to a shell prompt when
he presses ^Z.  If the `.' command is going to violate that expectation,
then at least the doc should say so somewhere.
