    I had it set, and my problem is exactly that: I must issue a cd
once to get them stored :( That means that some of my completion code
won't work as expected if I don't do a cd :(

    I'll do a 'cd .' in the completion widget or I'll make sure I
have done the 'hash -d' in my RC files. Thanks a lot for your help :))
