Those line just preserve the directory stack. If you've enabled
the completion system, all you need to do is type:

cd +<Tab>

and cycle through your past directories (you may need to set the
auto_pushd option as well).

See the "dirs" command, the auto_pushd option, the dirstack
array, the pushd/popd commands in zsh manual.
