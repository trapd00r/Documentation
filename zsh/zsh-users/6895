No, though I suppose you could call it a misfeature.

Zsh only examines the most recent 50 records when determining login/out
times, because searching the entire wtmp file would take far too long.
So if there's a lot of activity on the system, the record for the person
in question may have been pushed beyond 50-record region, and zsh falls
back to the current time.

If that doesn't seem to explain what you're seeing, let zsh-workers know.
