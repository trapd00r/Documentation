I pushed that one to sourceforge, just in case folks want to try out
the SF git support.  It's not enabled (user-visible) on the project,
but folks can clone/push/pull using it, if you want to give it a go:

    git://zsh.git.sf.net/gitroot/zsh            (read-only)
    ssh://USERNAME@zsh.git.sf.net/gitroot/zsh   (read/write)
