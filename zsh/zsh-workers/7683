I haven't played with it much yet (still discovering the joys of all
the bells and whistles with the new completion system,
e.g. description_format with group_matches, which is GREAT!) but I use
rpm a fair bit so of course I'll fix any more problems I find.  At
first glance however it looks fantastic.  Pressing tab after `rpm -b'
and getting:

> rpm -b
build stage
a -- build binary and source packages
b -- build a binary package
c -- execute build stage
i -- execute install stage
l -- do a list check
p -- execute %prep stage

blew my mind!  gcc, anyone? 8-)
