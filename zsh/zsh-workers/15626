I took a brief look; I'm not posting this to shell@ because I
don't have the time to follow it right now.

The adoption of bash-style /dev/{tcp,udp} into the standard
strikes me as a bad idea: not the functionality, but the
naming.

I was envisioning the use of some sort of special associative
array parameter as provided by zsh/tcp, before I was distracted.
