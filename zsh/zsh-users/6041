Hi!

I don't remember if I asked it allready, but there is new version
coming, so maybe once more: how to expand sth like this:

~: rpm -qi *devel*[tab]
RPM package
ORBit-devel-0.5.17-2                  esound-devel-0.2.29-1      libstdc++-devel-3.2.2-0.5
SDL-devel-1.2.5-4                     expat-devel-1.95.6-2       libtiff-devel-3.6.0-0.beta.1
[...]

? I'd like to bring all matches to command line:

~: rpm -qi ORBit-devel-0.5.17-2 SDL-devel-1.2.5-4 \
	esound-devel-0.2.29-1 expat-devel-1.95.6-2 \
	libstdc++-devel-3.2.2-0.5 libtiff-devel-3.6.0-0.beta.1 [...]

For files it works with ^x-* (or with some style/sth with tab).
