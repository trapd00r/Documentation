They are there, they're just called *.1 now.

It has been a rat's nest for quite a while.  Immediately prior to the
introduction of yodl, we were distributing both nroff and TeXinfo
forms, with the Makefile having rules to make info, HTML, DVI and
PostScript forms (from the TeXinfo).

The point of using yodl is that we only need to maintain *one* form of
the manual.  You now don't need to understand both nroff and TeXinfo to
patch the man page.  And the yodl is, I think, easier to maintain than
either nroff or TeXinfo was.
