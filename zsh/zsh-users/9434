} what's the point of having it as module then?

I never understood why it was made into a module in the first place.
It's static-linked into the main binary so it's not like it's keeping
down the size of the executable.

On the assumption, however, that there was a reason for it (and not
just "because we can"), autoloading ulimit in POSIX mode is needed.
Ideally limit and unlimit would remain disabled unless explicitly
asked for, but that might be more difficult.

} BTW, is there any particular reason there is no mention of the rlimits
} module in the manual.

Yes; because it's statically linked into the main binary and (except in
sh emulation) all the commands in it are marked for autoloading, so it
does not behave like a module most of the time.
