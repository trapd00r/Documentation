Do you ming a tempfile ?

foo () {
	tmp=/tmp/$0.$USER.$$

	/bin/blah > $tmp 2>&1
	exit="$?"
	
	grep -v foo $tmp && /bin/rm -f $tmp
	
	exit $exit

}

You don't have to use /tmp as the tempdir if you have security concerns..  
$HOME would work just as well.

ps -- if you use this function in your shell, doesn't it kill the shell ?
