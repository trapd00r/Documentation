Thanks for all your responses, "***" does work and does what i want it
to do, however what is the rationale behind differenitating symbolic
links, why doesn't "**" itself follow symbolic links too, it is very
difficult to write a generic script(without the proper knowledge of
whether one will hit symbolic links or not!)

Thanks,
