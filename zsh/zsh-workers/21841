    That's interesting, because it would explain another problem I'm
having, where the last character of a line exactly $COLUMNS long is
overwritten by the first character of PS1 if it is not followed by a
newline. OTOH, printing such line and printing a character afterwards
leads the correct result, that is, the character is printed in the
following line.

    In fact I don't know if it happens in current CVS, I've just
tested in 4.2.5
