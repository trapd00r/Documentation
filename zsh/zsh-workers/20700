} 'Standards conformance' section of the coreutils info says:

This is, by the way, only the GNU coreutils maintainer's interpretation
of the POSIX requirements; there was quite a lengthy argument about this
on the austin-group mailing list back in October 2004 or so, though I
don't recall whether an "official" resolution was ever approved.  At the
least there was not an agreement that this behavior really is required,
so far as I could tell.
