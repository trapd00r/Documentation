Indeed it has -- builds out of the box now, at least with HP's compiler.
I'll try gcc at some point after I actually get it installed.

The bad news is that some of the tests require tweaking of the modules
setup.  I'd swear I managed to dynamic load some pieces of pre-1 last
week, but I can't seem to do that on pre-3.  I'll try to figure out
what changed or if that was just my imagination.

Anyway, my current experience is that --disable-dynamic causes zsh/zpts
to get turned off, but after I add that as static all the tests pass up
to Y.  All three of the Y tests merely hang -- should I dig into this
more?  It sounds the same as what someone else reported recently.
