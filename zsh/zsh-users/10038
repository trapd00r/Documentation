You need the -W argument to _files; I'd suggest using "_path_files -W
<dir>", since going directly to _path_files removes some smart behaviour
in _files you don't want in this case.

So you need to use your specific directory, but override it if there's a
--dir.  You'll need to check if there's a --dir on the command line
already and grab it's argument.  You need something like:

  local dir=${words[(r)--dir=*]##--dir=}
  if [[ -z $dir ]]; then
    integer dirind=${words[(i)--dir]}
    if (( dirind )); then
      dir=$words[dirind+1]
    fi
  fi
  if [[ -z $dir ]]; then
    dir="default directory"
  fi

The most general way to avoid a separate function is the "->state"
action for _arguments; look in the zshcompsys manual page or various of
the more complicated functions (you need to make some variables local to
use it).  It sets the variable compstate which you can test to see if
it's in the particular state.

In your case, it might be possible to specify the description some
other way, so you could put the _path_files as the action, but I'm not
sure how.
