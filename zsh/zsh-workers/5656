Yes, I get this too on IRIX 6.2.  However, changing the arguments to the
second ps (adding e.g -u $USER or -e) does produce output.  So I think the
problem is that ps is getting confused somehow by the process group, and
simply not finding any processes to report.  Whether this is a bug due to
zsh setting up the process wrong, or simply ps's own confusion, is rather
hard to tell.
