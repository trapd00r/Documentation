I wonder, what are the benefits of Win32 version against Cygwin
 one? Zsh relies heavily on Unix semantic; to implement something that can
be called Zsh(-clone) on Win32 you need an emulation layer - and that is
exactly what Cygwin does. Creating Yet Another Unix Emulation on Win32
does not look very promising. And you need just a single DLL to run Cygwin
program (you do not need to install the whole Cygwin).

Or quite a number of Zsh features have to be omitted. But then it is not
Zsh anymore.

What do you mean under "multilanguage support"? We do not have any as of
now.
