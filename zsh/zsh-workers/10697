It's really a policy decision: when should zshpaths.h be rebuilt.
I've previously expressed my point of view on that -- that zshpaths.h
should always be made consistent with the parameter values effective in
the make in progress -- but there is a perfectly reasonable alternative
of making zshpaths.h from the originally configured values.  I have no
problem with either scheme.
