Subject: Use of ${words[0]} in completion functions
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

I just noticed that a couple of completion functions use ${words[0]} as
the command name.  That's a little misleading -- and maybe even a bug
waiting to happen -- because $_comp_options contains NO_ksharrays, and
neither of these functions resets it.

Completion/Unix/Type/_perl_modules:33:  local perl=${words[0]%doc} perl_modules

Completion/bashcompinit:123:	$OPTARG "${words[0]}" "${words[CURRENT-1]}" "${words[CURRENT-2]}"
