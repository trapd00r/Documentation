The original purpose of TMOUT is to automatically log out an idle shell.  This
means that the alarm is only set when a new prompt is printed, and and this
alarm is cancelled after each accept-line zle command.  TRAPALRM can be used
to do things periodially while you are editing in the zle buffer but it has no
effect while you are executing an external command.
