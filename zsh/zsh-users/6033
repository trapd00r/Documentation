The completion system changed and is much more usable but your 
question was too general and the changes were too many to answer this 
sufficiently. The main difference between /your/ old zsh (Amol's zsh) 
and your new one is that cygwin's zsh is a vanilla/Unix zsh and Amol's 
was a "hacked" Windows one.
