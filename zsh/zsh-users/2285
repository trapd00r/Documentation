Hi all,

    I dunno if this could be classified as a 'bug' since it doesn't really
affect anything, but anyway..

andre@drizzt:~% echo $ZSH_VERSION
3.1.5
andre@drizzt:~% zsh -e hello
zsh: 12935 segmentation fault  zsh -e hello
andre@drizzt:~% zsh -f hello
zsh: 12936 segmentation fault  zsh -f hello

    Seems like if try any invalid parameters, zsh segfaults.  (At least,
that's my guess).
