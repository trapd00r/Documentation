They're not. They're just as awful. This all the more reason to do one bett=

Do you think Google, when creating Google Maps, said 'Yahoo maps and
MapQuest can't pan without refreshing, why should we?' No, instead they sai=

'Hey, we can do something really useful the competition doesn't.'

Exactly. Bash is just as bad. Which is precisely why we should do one (or t=
wo)
better. Which is what we have to do to convince most people to
switch-- the barrier is higher for zsh because it is not installed on
most machines.

I'm not suggesting zsh become fish. I am merely suggesting that zsh should =
not
suck, out of the box, by default.
