:I realize most people on this list are now using 3.1.6-dev-19, but it'd
:be helpful to me if a few people could grab this and at least report any
:build-time errors.  Several of the changes are to the configure scripts,
:and I have only Linux to test on.

Builds OK on NetBSD 1.4T (i386).  Haven't done much testing yet.

If you feel the urge, you might want to update
    Etc/NEWS		(if appropriate)
    Etc/CONTRIBUTORS	(which would also need to be updated in 3.1.6-dev*)

Also, last section of Etc/BUGS says:
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Numeric ranges are still too greedy with using characters; for example,
    <1-1000>33 will not match 633 because the 633 matches the range.  Some
    backtracking will be necessary.
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Maybe make a note that this is fixed (according to some basic testing I did)
in the current development version (even though it still appears in the BUGS
file there).  I suspect it's a big change which isn't appropriate to roll
into 3.0.* but don't know for sure.
