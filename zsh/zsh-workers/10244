} This patch allows zsh to determine MACHTYPE at run-time, rather
} than from the configure results of the build-machine, assuming
} uname(2) is available.

My only issue with this is that it means MACHTYPE can no longer be
used as an indicator of what features are compiled into zsh.  Maybe
it never could, though ...

(Off-topic aside:

zagzig[102] uname -snrvm
Linux zagzig 2.0.36 #1 Tue Oct 13 22:17:11 EDT 1998 i686
zagzig[103] uname -a
Linux zagzig 2.0.36 #1 Tue Oct 13 22:17:11 EDT 1998 i686 unknown

Where'd that extra "unknown" come from?)
