} _values is doing something weird [traditional pause for amazed cries to die

} then further down there's this:
} 
}       if [[ ${#noargs}+${#args}+${#opts} -ne 1 ]] && compvalues -s sep; then
}         sep=( "-qS" "$sep" )
}       else
}         sep=()
}       fi

That all appears to date back to zsh-workers/8219 when Sven first added
the compvalues call.  SourceForge CVS won't help because it doesn't go
back that far.  Then look at workers/14257.  Could Sven have missed a
spot where he needed to make a change?  Also, perhaps some of those calls
to "compvalues -s sep" should (or at least could) be changed to instead
test (( $+sep )) or something?
