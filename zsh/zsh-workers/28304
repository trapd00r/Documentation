I was somewhat concerned that this was going to happen.  This must be
because of zsh-workers/28295 (use lexer to split words from history).

The logging-off part is actually of more concern, it's probably because
you are sharing history and/or have some of the duplicate-suppression
options set.

Probably the right thing to do is:

(1) have an option for the new behavior (HIST_LEX_WORDS ?);

(2) implicitly turn that option off on the way through shell exit, so
    history rewrites/comparisons use faster processing.
