info is nigh-unusable for someone not comfortable with emacs; I've
been a vi user for many years, and find info horrifyingly hard to
use.  pinfo isn't so bad, but still very uncomfortable for a vi
user.

My pager is "less".  I'm pretty comfortable with that.  I do
understand your point, though; beyond a certain size, hierarchy is
important, I agree.  I didn't realize an info for zsh was installed.

It wouldn't have helped at all in this case, though, as I had no
idea where in the hierarchy to look.  I'm trying to get
edit-command-line to work now, and I *still* don't know where to
look.
