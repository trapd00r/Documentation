My attempt at this was along the lines of:

mailpath=( ~/mail/*.spool(e:'REPLY=( "${REPLY}?You have new mail in ${REPLY:t:r}")':) )

it doesn't need a fork but there seems to be a bug somewhere because I
get `zsh: unmatched "' errors. It's okay if I remove the :t:r modifiers
though.

And running this twice in 4.1.0-dev-6 (but not in 4.0.2) causes a seg fault:
  echo *(e:'REPLY=( ${REPLY}?${REPLY} )':)

(I forgot to quote the ? when trying that)
