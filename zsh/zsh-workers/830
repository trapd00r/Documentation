Yes, it's very good.

This seems like a great idea.  I've been writing a lot (for me at
least) documentation recently using perlpod and am quite taken with
it.  It is so easy to make simple pages that I find myself actually
giving my end users documentation much quicker than I used to.

In the past I used TeX, but that made it difficult to distribute
online documentation.

The caveat is that perlpod's "intent is simplicity, not power", and
that you can't do complex things.

We should also provide a zsh*.man as well as a zsh*.pod for those
people who don't have Perl installed.

As of today the pod2texi isn't very usable.
