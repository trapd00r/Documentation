Just a few words ...

I don't want to get into anything that looks like a multidimensional
array.  OK would be $matches[prefix(num)] or something ... though in
thinking about it a bit further, I think I prefer requiring the (r) or
(R) flag to activate any such magic, e.g. $matches[(r)prefix(num)].
The connection to patterns is useful; it's just a special case of a
pattern.
