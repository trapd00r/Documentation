The interesting question is:  are there times when you need the double
quotes (for some other reason), but *still* don't want empty elements
removed?  That would explain the kludge.

I certainly agree that

% print -l ${(s.:.)foo}

*should* remove empty elements.

We could in any case apply no-removal behaviour to the version with the
"@" flag (which we can detect even though it's not current having a
special effect in the expression at the top).  That seems
unobjectionable, since the presence of the "@" specifies "$@"-like
behaviour.  I'll do that if no one can see a further objection, though
it still leaves the kludge.
