[I use zsh on NT, version 3.0.5-nt-beta-0.54]

When I set path as an array, the value is reflected in the uppercase PATH
environment variable:

    $ path=(one two three)
    $ echo $PATH
    one;two;three
    $

However, this doesn't work for (most) other variables:

    $ classpath=(one two three)
    $ echo $CLASSPATH
    c:/jdk1.1.7B/lib/classes.zip;.


How can I arrange for this to work with for my CLASSPATH example?

[please copy me on any responses, as I'm not on the mailing list]

Thanks,
