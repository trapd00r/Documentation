They can be, but I don't think completely altering the interface is the
right way to deal with people misusing it.  There are perfectly good, if
specialised, reasons for adding stuff.  I'm exactly at this moment in the
middle of installing a version of cygwin with a version of zsh that
connects to our Bluetooth chip via the serial port.  Using the /etc files
is the only easy way of setting this up.  This is not supposed to be a
sufficient argument on its own --- but if I've got a reason for doing this,
so have a lot of other people.  Removing this is just cutting off your nose
to spite your face.

The way forward is to educate people over the use of startup script.
They're willing to learn if you explain things to them.
