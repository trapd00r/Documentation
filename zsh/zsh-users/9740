    Hi all :)

    $ zsh -f
    $ emulate -LR zsh
    $ var="one|two||four|five"
    $ vara=("${(s:|:)var}")
    $ print $vara[3]
    four
    $ setopt rcexpandparam
    $ vara=("${(s:|:)var}")
    $ print ·$vara[3]·
    ··

    I didn't expect this, there is no array expansions (except in the
print command of course, but that shouldn't be affected by
RC_EXPAND_PARAM) :???????????? If I add "^" to the vara assignment,
then it works as expected, so the RC_EXPAND_PARAM is making a
difference there!

    What am I doing wrong? Is this a bug or a feature?

    Thanks in advance :)
