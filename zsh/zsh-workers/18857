It occurred to me we could test with the tag, then without, for
compatibility; something similar is done in other places, though usually
with some default tag.

That's certainly arguable, but there's still something to be said for
giving people control anyway, in the same way you can override the set
of matched files.  I think the question is: are people likely to use a
general enough context that it gives unexpected effects with sorting
elsewhere?
