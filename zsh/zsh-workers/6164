Maybe this is possible and I've just missed it.

Why is there no compile-time option equivalent to runtime "zmodload -a ..."?

I'd like to define a module that is not linked into the binary, and that
gets autoloaded if one of the builtins etc. it defines is referenced, but
that does not require that any rc-file execute any zmodload commands.

(Yes, this is the message forward-referenced in zsh-workers/6162.)
