This is a small enhancement for "zsh-mime-setup -l" to take arguments.

I thought about expanding completion for suffix aliases in verbose mode
to show what handler would be executed, but unfortunately completion for
suffix aliases disappaers into _path_files, from which no one has ever
returned.  Possibly I can persuade _list_files to do something clever
(since I wrote that for the purpose of a software trick called "code
reusability" that the completion system doesn't generally implement).
