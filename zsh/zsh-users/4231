It also screws everything up completely, appearing at that point.  That's
why I tried to do the minimum, saving the options to an ordinary array,

OK, I missed the point that Adam wants to restart the shell as it was
invoked, rather than as it now is.  You can argue which is more useful.
If you don't use -f, you can at least arrange to restart it as it was after
the startup scripts finished the last time, which is equivalent if you want
to prepare a given environment.  With -f you're more stuck.
