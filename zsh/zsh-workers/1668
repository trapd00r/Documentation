Aha!  Thanks!

What announcement?  This could at least be included within the patchfiles
that are on ftp.math.gatech.edu...  I'm not on any ZSH mailing list.
Generally, patches come with instructions.

The only reason I knew to mail this list was by READING THE DOCUMENTATION.
A new concept, no?

Thanks again,
