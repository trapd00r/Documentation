Hi,

When I try to do this keybinding in my startup script:

    bindkey -M menuselect '^O' accept-and-infer-next-history

it fails due to the keymap not being present.

At that point compinit has already been called to set the system up. What else do I need to do before the bindkey?

Cheers,

Martin.
