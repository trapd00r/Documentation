Completions for ssh/scp give up to early, without trying all completers in
the appropriate zstyle, because _remote_files always returns success even
when it finds no matches.

The drawback to fixing this is that ssh/scp completions may get a lot
slower, because multiple remote executions of "ls" may occur in order
to satisfy all the possible combinations.
