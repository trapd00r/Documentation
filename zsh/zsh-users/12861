You will need to apply the patch I just sent, which is entirely shell code
(apart from the documentation).  If you don't have access to the
installation you can locate _path_files in your fpath and put it in your
own functions directory setting

fpath=(~/myfns $fpath)

or whatever.  Then you need to set

zstyle ':completion:*' accept-exact-dirs true

in ~/.zshrc.
