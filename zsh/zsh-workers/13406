It seems to never be "cleaned up" (even after make distclean). That's easy.
But it depends on *.mdd files in obvious fashion. I'm tempted to put list of
all *.mdd in top level Makefile and make config.modules depend on them. You'll
still need to remove it (or do make distclean) when adding/removing modules
but not when existing module definition is changed.

Better way to do it?
