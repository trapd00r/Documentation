I'm a new user to zsh and was wondering what version I should be
using.  I am currently using zsh 2.5.03 on Solaris 2.4.  

Using this version, "echo -n foo" doesn't work as expected.  I
expected echo -n to print without a newline, instead nothing is
printed:

        zen% echo foo
        foo
        zen% echo -n foo
        zen% 

Is it worth moving to the current Beta?  Is it stable enough for every
day use?

Thanks,
Chris Dean
