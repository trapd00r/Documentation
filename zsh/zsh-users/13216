I think you want "vared -h ..." ?

     If the -p flag is given, the following string will be taken as the
     prompt to display at the left.  If the -r flag is given, the
     following string gives the prompt to display at the right.  If the
     -h flag is specified, the history can be accessed from ZLE. If the
     -e flag is given, typing ^D (Control-D) on an empty line causes
     vared to exit immediately with a non-zero return value.

You can combine this with "fc -p"/"fc -P" to use a different history in
vared.  See Functions/Misc/sticky-note for an example.

As for whether a descriptor is "interactive", probably the closest you
can get is "[[ -t 0 ]]" (replace 0 with the fd you're interested in).
