My guess is that there's something up with the .zcompdump file. That's a
file in your home directory that caches information about available
completion functions. If you remove it and log in again, the problem may
be fixed.

Before deleting .zcompdump, can you take a backup. If removing it fixes
the problem, please e-mail us a copy of the bad .zcompdump file. We may
be able to make it more robust (comparing _comps to #files perhaps).
