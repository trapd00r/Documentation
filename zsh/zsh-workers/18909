From: Haakon Riiser <haakon.riiser@fys.uio.no>

Subject: Segfault in completion code
Message-ID: <20030727014210.GA11368@s.chello.no>
Mail-Followup-To: zsh-workers@sunsite.dk
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Disposition: inline
User-Agent: Mutt/1.4.1i

Steps to reproduce:

  % unset IFS
  % <try to perform any type of completion>
  zsh: segmentation fault  zsh

Verified on several systems and versions:

  zsh 4.1.1 (i686-pc-linux-gnu)
  zsh 4.0.2 (i686-pc-linux-gnu)
  zsh 4.0.2 (sparc-sun-solaris2.6)

I know that the zsh manual doesn't make any promises as to what
happens when IFS is unset, but I assumed it would be okay since
bash explicitly allows it.  Regardless, segfaulting over it seems
a bit harsh, so I would guess it's a bug. :-)
