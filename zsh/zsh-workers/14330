Subject: PATCH: _most_recent_file
Date: Mon, 14 May 2001 14:18:47 +0100
From: Peter Stephenson <pws@csr.com>

Just noticed this is bad about quoting, both with existing quoted
characters and inserting characters which need quoting.  Probably there
wasn't a way to fix this simply when I first wrote it.  Don't suppose
anyone else uses it anyway.
