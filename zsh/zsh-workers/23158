They'd have to be doing it by using builtin queries ("typeset -m",
"alias -m", etc. etc.), which is even more unlikely.  Hash tables
substituted onto the command line still aren't sorted --- I only changed
it for cases where the output is printed immediately, so:

% typeset -A hashtable
% hashtable=(a A b B c C d D e E f F g G)
% print ${(kv)hashtable}
f F g G a A b B c C d D e E

(It confused me when I tried it with just a, b and c to begin with...)
There have always been the "o" and "O" flags to request an order here,
anyway.
