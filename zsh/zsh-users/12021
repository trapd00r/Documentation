[...]

zmodload -i zsh/parameters
export PAGER=\
${commands[most]:-\
${commands[less]:-\
${commands[w3m]:-\
${commands[pager]:-\
more}}}}

or, portably:

for PAGER in most less w3m pager more; do
  command -v "$PAGER" > /dev/null 2>&1 && break
done
export PAGER
  
as I don't think you need the full path in $PAGER.
