cvs.zsh.sourceforge.net no longer works for remote (ssh) cvs repository
access; the error is

	Cannot access /cvsroot/zsh/CVSROOT
	No such file or directory

Instead one must use cvs.sourceforge.net, which causes every file in the
sandbox to be reported as in conflict with the repository, unless the
CVS/Root files are "manually" corrected to refer to the new host:

	perl -pi.rm -e 's/cvs\.zsh/cvs/' **/CVS/Root
	rm **/CVS/Root.rm

Annoying to say the least.  Did anyone know this was coming?
