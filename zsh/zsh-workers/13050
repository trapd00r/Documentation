} There are possibly other places where this may cause confusion.

There are probably a very large number of such places; think of all the
places where Clint just finished removing references to PATH_MAX.

Think of all the shell functions that manipulate paths with $x:h, $x:t,
${x#*/}, ${x%/*}, [[ $x == /* ]], etc.

The problem is only going to "go away" when the user stops referring to
Windows drives by `x:' and uses the /cygdrive form exclusively.  Otherwise
no matter how good a job zsh does of catching `x:' when it manipulates a
string it knows internally is a path name, there's a potential for strings
that it *doesn't* know are path names to become "mangled" (and then later
used as a path name, when it's too late for zsh to fix it).

This is not to say that we shouldn't try to fix e.g. `cd' to do the right
thing as often as possible, but that the general problem of nonuniform path
formats is very difficult except in a rigid UI where pathnames are never
entered except in pathname-typed input boxes.
