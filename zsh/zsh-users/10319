Hi,

Since I'm subscribed to the users mailing list, I'm posting this here.

I've fixed the following configure error on zeta, see:

http://www.yellowtab.com/products/

with the following patch agains 4.2.5.  The RE *may* need or warrant
some further tweakig, but it happens that on Zeta (BeOS) as well as
Haiku, error codes are defined like the following:

#define ESIGPARM                (B_POSIX_ERROR_BASE + 15)

And at least on Haiku, the following can also be seen:

#define ENOMEM             B_NO_MEMORY


Have fun, and I hope you'll incorporate it,


Johann -- working on further tweaks to port zsh

I classify Outlook mail as spam, use something else.
