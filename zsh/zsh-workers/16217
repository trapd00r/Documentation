Subject: supress suffix (blank) in completion menu (selection)
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=KOI8-R; format=flowed
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

I want to complete prefix of more long word that is known to be 
incomplete. I do not want any suffix added (because you have to enter 
some data after this prefix anyway). Still menu selection adds blank 
when I accept current choice.

To illustrate:

         elif compset -P removable_; then
             compadd -- cdrom_ floppy_ && return 0

that is part of

removable_cdrom_0://...

i.e. after I completed to removable_cdrom_ I have to enter number.
