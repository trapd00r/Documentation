Hmm, this one is a conundrum.  My first instinct would be to add -R to
the "emulate" command at the top, rather than try to fix every native
zsh-ism in the source; certainly that's correct for zargs, but it may
not be for match-words-by-style if there are completion-related options
that would be reset by that.

OTOH -R is supposed to avoid changing options that affect the interactive
behavior, so maybe it's a bug that emaulate -R changes e.g. completeinword.
