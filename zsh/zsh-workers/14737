We've done this before.  They only need posting separately at all if they
are designed for both versions and the same patch doesn't apply to both.
Bart tended to submit altered versions for 3.0 where necessary, but we
didn't have the archive then.  I imagine people using 4.0 won't need
up-to-the minute patches posted here unless they refer to a particular
problem which has turned off.  So we probably won't usually need to post
4.0 patches.

Preferably the original author can commit it to both branches if that's
necessary, at least until the rate of fixes dies down.
