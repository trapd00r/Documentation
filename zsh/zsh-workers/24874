I tend to agree with this.  It's doable, and the standard (SUS 2004)
supports the idea (see under LC_CTYPE) although it's a little bit
two-faced (only ASCII space characters are listed as requiring quoting,
for example).  However,

- I've been resisting having to convert the byte stream into anything
  else for basic shell parsing.  I've got far better things to do
  than make the shell slower and buggier for a feature of doubtful
  general utility.
- Having basic syntactic elements depending on the locale is really
  nasty.  We have one such kludge ourselves, (NO_)POSIX_IDENTIFIERS,
  which is mostly a sop to traditional pre-multibyte zsh behaviour.  I
  would actively discourage people from assuming this sort of behaviour.
- It seems to me somewhat ludicrous making a change specifically so
  that arguments can be separated by a "non-breaking" space.  Is it
  or isn't it breakable?
- This isn't a general solution to mistyping anyway.  You might be able
  to fix alt-gr space with xmodmap or the terminal emulator translation
  table.

(Yes, I know "a little bit two-faced" is meaningless, strictly
speaking.  I stopped speaking strictly years ago now.)
