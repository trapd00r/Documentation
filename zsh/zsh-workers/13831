The only thing that worries me, given this explanation, is clusters of
single-letter options, like some of the very specialized cases in _rpm.
A whole lot of work went into making those cluster in just about every
ordering that might make sense to rpm, and some of them are pretty odd;
for example, -i means something different when it's the first option on
the line than it does when it follows -q, so `rpm -iq...' completes
differently from `rpm -qi...'.

It doesn't *appear* that anything has gone wrong with it, but there are
so many possible combinations to try ...
