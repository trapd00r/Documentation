It's in grammar.yo (the start of zshmisc(1)): the assignment only works
when it's at the front of a "simple command", as defined there.  So it
won't work in the case of a function definition, although there probably
ought to be an error.  However, this isn't to do with anonymous
functions:

% N=5 fn() { echo $N; }
% which fn
fn not found


A em(simple command) is a sequence of optional parameter
assignments followed by blank-separated words,
with optional redirections interspersed.
The first word is the command to be executed, and the remaining
words, if any, are arguments to the command.
If a command name is given, the parameter assignments modify
the environment of the command when it is executed.
The value of a simple command is its exit status,
or 128 plus the signal number if terminated by a signal.
For example,
