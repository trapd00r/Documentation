It looks like autoconf's basic test to find iconv.h is failing. Does
your compiler really look in /usr/local by default? If you do:
  export CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include
before running configure, does it then find iconv.h?

Is the iconv in /usr/local/lib GNU libiconv or FreeBSD's own iconv? What
is libkiconv? It's often better to avoid using GNU libiconv if there's
a builtin iconv.
