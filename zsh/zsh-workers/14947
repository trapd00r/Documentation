I currently have a patch for HEAD that should fix the reported problems 
in AIX. Unforunately, I have no feedback so far. The patch actually 
consists of

- fix a bug introduced by me at some point (changed cache variable 
name). This would prevent dynamic loading even on tested AIX 3.x. I 
guess, it must go 4.0.2 in any case

- reshuffle if's in zshconfig.ac to force AIX style if AIX functions 
were found.

- add test for base type of third argument of access(). AIX compiler is 
picky as it seems. Currently it tests for int *, unsigned long * and 
size_t * and defaults to int * if everything else fails. We currently 
use int * in code so it should not break any system but you know ...


I guess, I should commit it to HEAD anyway. You decide if it should go 
in 4.0.2.
