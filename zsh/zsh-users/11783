Unfortunately parameter expansion does a zillion different things,
defined by the order they happen to occur in the code, so the description
"the result" is never going to be very helpful.  Some order dependence
is documented and this probably ought to be.

That's actually easy:  ${(L):-${(%):-%n}} (or %m if that's what you
meant).  This is fully guaranteed against programmers' whims.
