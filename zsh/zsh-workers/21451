One other complication I forgot to mention:  there were some terminals
that handled this the other way 'round -- instead of ignoring the wrap
when followed by a CR, NL, etc., they really did wrap after $COLUMNS
characters, and then ignored a NL that came right after the wrap (which
is why the termcap attribute is "xn" for ignore newline).  I think that
the vt100-compatible "firm margins" attribute may be indicated by an
"xv" in the termcap, but it's not well documented, so it seems likely
that this "xv" attribute is not going to be reliably supplied by a
variety of OSes.

So, the current "xn" logic in my posted patch seems like it is likely to
be the most compatible way to go (since I doubt anyone uses a Concept
terminal these days).
