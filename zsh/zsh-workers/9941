Just a note to say that I still exist, with this email (for work).  It
currently looks like I won't get
a chance to do anything at all Z-Shell related, even look at the mailing
list, until after the
weekend of 18/19th March.  If there are enough changes to warrant anyone
else making
a development version (or just tarring up Tanaka Akira's archive, though
editing the
ChangeLog would also be a good idea), they should feel free to do so.

P.S. When did punctuation in domainnames go out of fashion?
