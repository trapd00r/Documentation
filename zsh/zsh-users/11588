In combination with recursive globs looking at stuff, wanting to look at
a user's files, not whatever they might be linking to?

Ie, I might use ***/*(-.) in some places, but **/*(.) is the safer mode,
especially when invoked as root.

Changing the default behaviour would be just too clever and likely to
have unintended security repercussions so if it's a new option, please
make it default to off?
