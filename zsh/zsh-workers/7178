This has always been the case.  Commands aren't entered into the history
until they finish being executed (or are stopped, or backgrounded with &).
That's one reason why the histnostore option exists.

} Worse: I now set HISTNOSTORE in addition to the others, type `h', then

This is new in pws-something: I can't reproduce it in 3.0.5 or 3.0.6-pre.
