As far as I can verify, although the ligatures æ and œ can be entered using
insert-compose-character with the digraphs ae and oe respectively, the upper
case ligatures Æ and Œ cannot, and zsh claims "no such combination" on AE and
OE. Is it just my problem, or can you fix it? I am using the CVS HEAD zsh on
Linux.

Best,

Zvi.

PS. On Solaris, insert-compose-character still doesn't work for me.
