} routines fails.

I don't have access to Solaris 7 documentation, and everything on-line
at sun.com is already Solaris 8 (and remarkably uninformative).  What
librar(y|ies) (is|are) supposed to provide inet_aton() and inet_pton() ?

For example, it may be necessary to add

    AC_CHECK_LIB(socket, inet_pton)
                 ^^^^^^
		 or nsl, or something

before the call to AC_CHECK_FUNCS(...) that includes inet_{a,p}ton.
