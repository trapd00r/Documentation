Subject: Problems with Functions/Misc/nslookup
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Most seriously, on my system it doesn't always notice when the prompt is
back:

schaefer[502] nslookup                                              4.0.1-pre-5
Default Server:  ns.best.com
Address:  204.156.128.1

> set querytype=mx
(hangs here until interrupted)

I think this may be because nslookup does not print anything at all (not
even a blank line) before printing the prompt, after executing a `set'
command.  It does find the prompt after a name lookup (see below).

Then there's this interesting completion behavior:

schaefer[504] nslookup                                              4.0.1-pre-5
Default Server:  ns.best.com
Address:  204.156.128.1

> zanshin.com
Server:  ns.best.com
Address:  204.156.128.1

Name:    zanshin.com
Address:  167.160.213.139

> set querytype=m<TAB>
> set querytype=m:\{a-zA-Z\}=\{A-Za-z\}\ r:\|\[-._,\]=\*\*\ r:\|=\*\* 

I'm pretty sure it wasn't supposed to literally insert a matcher spec there.
:-)
