} But it explicitly uses $fignore when the pattern is `*'. And it works
} for me with `zsh -f', setting $fignore and doing `ls <TAB>'.

} Could you give me an example where it fails to do what you want?

It's apparently this style that's causing me trouble:

    zstyle ':completion:*' file-sort modification reverse

If _path_files is going to check for a pattern of `*', it needs to do so
with any globbing flags first stripped off.  Ouch.
