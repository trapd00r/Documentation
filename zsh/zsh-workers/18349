Subject: Unsorted completion list from _describe?
Date: Thu, 13 Mar 2003 20:07:46 +0000
Message-ID: <4206.1047586066@csr.com>
From: Peter Stephenson <pws@csr.com>

Does anyone have any idea of how to get _describe (the lowest level
completion function that handles verbose descriptions for completion
lists) not to sort the completion list?  It ought to be something to do
with passing down `-V' as an option somewhere, but I can't get it to
work and _describe and the bits below aren't all that transparent.
