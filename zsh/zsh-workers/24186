As far as I understood it (it doesn't seem to be well documented) that
only does translations which are pre-compiled into the shell (or rather
its libraries).  We need something which can be updated with completion
functions.  It's OK if the definitions are in another file (though we
could presumably have an interface which adds translations from the
completion function itself) but it needs to be added at run time.

Possibly we can still do this with $"...", but I don't like the idea
that if you change the original message you can no longer find the
translation, which seems to me to be asking for trouble.
