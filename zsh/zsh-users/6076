It should be pointed out that assigning the =(...) expression to a variable
is meant to be the only way to get the temporary file to persist.  In all
other cases (and, in older versions of zsh, even for assignments) the file
is automatically removed as soon as the surrounding expression completes.

In short, This Should Not Happen unless zsh is crashing or you are doing
something unusual to cause the file to be left behind.
