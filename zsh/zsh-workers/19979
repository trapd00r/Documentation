Personally, I find build systems that override my CFLAGS to be pretty
annoying.

As far as the warning hunt goes, I'll change the Debian builds from
"-Wall -O2" to "-Wall -W -O2".  Once I remember to do that, the build
logs will be accessible from

http://buildd.debian.org/build.php?arch=&pkg=zsh

and

http://buildd.debian.org/build.php?arch=&pkg=zsh-beta


That won't catch most compat functions or ZSH_MEM stuff though.
