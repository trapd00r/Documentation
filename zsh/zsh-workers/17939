My guess is the test `RLIMIT_RSS != RLIMIT_VMEM' is incorrectly failing
in the preprocessor, i.e. it thinks RLIMIT_RSS == RLIMIT_VMEM owing to
the way the definitions are laid out.  Checking
/usr/include/sys/resource.h or carefully hidden equivalent should
confirm or refute this.  The following programme might help.

  #include <stdio.h>
  #include <sys/resource.h>

  int main(int argc, char **argv)
  {
  #if defined(RLIMIT_RSS) && defined(RLIMIT_VMEM)
      printf("You have both definitions.\n");
      if (RLIMIT_RSS == RLIMIT_VMEM)
      {
	  printf("Both have the same value.\n");
      }
      else
      {
	  printf("They have different values.\n");
  #if RLIMIT_RSS == RLIMIT_VMEM
	  printf("!!!You should never see this message!!!\n");
  #endif
      }
  #else
  #ifdef RLIMIT_RSS
      printf("You only have RSS\n");
  #else
  #ifdef RLIMIT_VMEM
      printf("You only have VMEM\n");
  #else
      printf("You have neither definition.\n");
  #endif
  #endif
  #endif

      return 0;
  }

We could probe this more reliably than at present in configure.
