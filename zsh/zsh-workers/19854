Well, you could do the equivalent of "strings =sudo | grep sbin:", but
that seems ugly and error-prone.

I'd suggest using a sane default which can be overridden with zstyle.

I have a sneaking suspicion that sudo isn't the only command for which
it would make sense to override the path for _command_names though.
