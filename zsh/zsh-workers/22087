Hi,

There is one annoying thing in handling history file in zsh. When it uses=20
tmpfile (not append mode) and just does rename(".historyz.new", ".history")=
=20
it looses all permissions and user/owner of the original .historyz file.

Exaple, I'm working as user arekm and .historyz has arekm:users user/group =
but=20
if I do sudo zsh; ls; exit then it's renamed and I end up with .historyz=20
being root:root and since I've exited sudo and I'm back as arekm:users my=20
history is no longer saved.

Attached patch makes zsh restore original permissions/owner/group of HISTFI=
LE=20
after sucessful rename. It's against HEAD (4.3) cvs version.

Any races here (between stat and chown/chmod) shouldn't be unsafe I guess.

Thanks!
