} This wouldn't work as sja always complained that it couldn't find param.xml
} 
} I guess this is because zsh is somehow interpreting the
} /somepath/params.xml before passing it on.

Actually it's more likely because zsh is NOT interpreting the path, and
bash (or whatever /bin/sh is) DOES interpret it.

That is, the DOS utility is probably expecting \somepath\params.xml
but zsh passes it through unchanged with forward slashes instead.
