Subject: zsh debug tracing with timestamp
X-Mailer: VM 6.92 under Emacs 20.7.1

Any method to insert timestamp in front of the trace command turned on
by set -x?  We try to troubleshoot zsh startup time problem when
people sharing the common zsh startup across US and in India.
Timestamp will give us a clue which part take the longest and we
can then make proper adjustment.

Any help will be appreciated.
