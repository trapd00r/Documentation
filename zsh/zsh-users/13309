You're seeing the difference between the "up-line-or-history" widget
and the "vi-up-line-or-history" widget (and similarly for "down-").
The vi- widgets move the cursor to the beginning of the line while
moving up and down, and the others move it to the end.

What's puzzling to me is that the *default* bindings for the history
motions are the other ones, even in the vi keymaps.  So in order for
you to have the behavior you're describing, you (or someone who put
bindings in your /etc/z* files) must have explicitly bound the arrow
keys to the vi widgets.
