} Moving the local out of the loop fixes the echo of course... But I do
} not think it should matter.

This is not a bug, it's documented behavior of `typeset' for which
`local' is an alias:

    For each remaining name that refers to a parameter that is set,
    the name and value of the parameter are printed in the form of an
    assignment. Nothing is printed for newly-created parameters, or when
    any attribute flags listed below are given along with the name.

In 4.1.1-dev, you can `setopt typeset_silent' to suppress this.
