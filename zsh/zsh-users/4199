one more dumb question.  if i want to link zsh to the copy of ncurses in
my home directory instead of the machine's, but i still want to use the
remainder of the machine's include files, how do i need to configure
zsh?

i have ncurses 5.2 installed in ~/include and ~/lib with the terminfo
stuff in ~/share/terminfo
