} Can someone confirm this is a suitable patch for removing support for
} old versions of autoconf, together with deleting configure.in which I
} will commit at the same time?

I'm not sure why you think these three lines have anything to do with
autoconf 2.13 specifically.

} -AC_OUTPUT_COMMANDS(,[if test -z "\$CONFIG_FILES\$CONFIG_HEADERS"; then
} -`cat ./${CONFIG_MODULES}.sh && rm -f ./${CONFIG_MODULES}.sh`
} -fi])

IIRC those lines are there so that the commands in ./${CONFIG_MODULES}.sh
get re-run when config.status is run.  That was not *intended* as a fix
only for autoconf 2.13; why is it not needed in 2.50?
