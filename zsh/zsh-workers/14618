Probably, but more expensive (dunno how much slower it makes it,
though).  And one would have to get rid of the paths and suffixes, which
isn't trivial.

I seem to remember that someone said it would be nice to have, but it's
so hard to implement, because we can't easily rely on the compadd-
options since they are used by _path_files itself.  On the other hand,
_path_files builds an array with the matches, but what to do with all
the prefixes and suffixes that make the calls to compadd so complicated
in _path_files?
