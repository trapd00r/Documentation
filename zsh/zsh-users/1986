I can't reproduce this crash using (approximately, since the patches were
applied individually) the patched zsh to which PWS has previously posted
a pointer.  In an unpatched 3.1.5 I can reproduce it, but the stack gets
completely trashed so I can't get a backtrace from gdb and haven't figured
out exactly which patch fixes it.
