I don't know that it's always false, but here's a small snapshot of
those comparisons during a zsh/files rm -rf attempt.

[ h->used + (new - old) > HEAP_ARENA_SIZE ]
63432 + (63504 - 63432) > 16360
63504 + (63576 - 63504) > 16360
63576 + (63648 - 63576) > 16360
63648 + (63728 - 63648) > 16360
63728 + (63800 - 63728) > 16360
63800 + (63872 - 63800) > 16360
63872 + (63944 - 63872) > 16360
63944 + (64024 - 63944) > 16360
64024 + (64096 - 64024) > 16360
64096 + (64168 - 64096) > 16360
64168 + (64240 - 64168) > 16360
64240 + (64320 - 64240) > 16360
