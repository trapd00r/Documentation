Here's another make-related problem (for me at least).  I didn't
notice it before because Etc/FAQ already existed (I think).

AFAICS, a normal make with no target doesn't descend into Etc/.  This
only means that FAQ doesn't get built from FAQ.yo, but I would like it
to be, so that FAQ can be included in my rpm builds.  Is this OK?
