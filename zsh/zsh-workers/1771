} 
} Note that a function can always change options of the caller by unsetting
} localoptions before return.

Yes, which means that any function that's going to be a wrapper around
"setopt" has to unsetopt localoptions, which is what my functions do.
Thus even if you try to setopt localoptions, the setopt wrapper will
still change the options of the caller.

If you can think of a workaround for this, I'd be thrilled to hear it.
