Sorry to waste a little bandwith for this, but I wanted to give the first
few respondents to this message some major kudos.

To me, the original message sounded a bit like an attempt to start a flame
war.  Rather than responding in kind or castigating the fellow for poor
manners, you all responded very professionally.  Rare to see these days in
Internet forums, and highly appreciated.

[And yes, for the record, I like the feature Mr. pacman was complaining
about]
