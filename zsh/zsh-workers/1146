I should have realized that this bug was too severe to be universal.
Sorry about that.  I saw that behavior on dgux 5.4.3.10 with gcc 2.5.8
(the standard system compiler).  When I recompiled with debugging rather
than optimization the problem disappeared, so by definition it must be a
bug in the compiler.
