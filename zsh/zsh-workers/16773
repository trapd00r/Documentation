Subject: Core dump on completion after `for'
Date: Wed, 06 Mar 2002 19:19:36 +0000
Message-ID: <7819.1015442376@csr.com>
From: Peter Stephenson <pws@csr.com>

% ./zsh -f
% for f in <TAB>zsh: segmentation fault (core dumped)  ./zsh -f

It's at the first sprintf in the following in get_comp_string().  tok is
51, which is FOR, which is out of range for tokstrings, which only
handles tokens looking like punctuation.

	if (inredir) {
            rdstr = rdstrbuf;
            if (tokfd >= 0)
                sprintf(rdop, "%d%s", tokfd, tokstrings[tok]);
            else
                strcpy(rdop, tokstrings[tok]);
            strcpy(rdstr, rdop);
        }

We've got to this branch because redir is set for special commands which
take lists in ctxtlex():

    if (IS_REDIROP(tok) || tok == FOR || tok == FOREACH || tok == SELECT) {
	inredir = 1;
    ...

so there are two ways to handle it:  make these three tokens special
cases of redirections, or simply ignore the inredir flag for them.
