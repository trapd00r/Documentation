When I was doing this I used these commands to access the CVS
archive.. 
cvs -d :pserver:kevins@sunsite.auc.dk:/pack/anoncvs login
cvs -d :pserver:kevins@sunsite.auc.dk:/pack/anoncvs checkout zsh

Now you should replace kevins@sunsite.auc.dk with opk@sunsite.auc.dk

This worked fine for me just now...
