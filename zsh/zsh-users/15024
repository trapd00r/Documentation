I've been meaning to reply for a week now, I did find a bug which is =
vaguely annoying. However, I'd been meaning to sit down and try and work =
it out myself. If I disable path-completion it does fix the original =
problem but it also produces a new one.

If you have a path with a "special" character in it, where by special so =
far I've found space and tilde, then completion stops offering results =
after that letter. It's particularly frustrating on a Mac, where many =
app bundles have spaces in their names but the actual executables are =
another two layers of directories deeper after the bundle name.

Also, we happen to have scripts at work that output directories with ~ =
in them (don't ask me why, I've no idea).

Any ideas?
