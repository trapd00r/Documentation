Another thought, is it possible to get it to /never/ expand directories. =
I almost (read. only by accident) never specify a directory below where =
the cursor is with an incomplete name. It seems wasteful and slow for =
autocompletion to go ferreting around network volumes looking for =
alternatives. Especially in an automount environment where such =
traversal could cause additional wait time whilst mounting other =
volumes?
