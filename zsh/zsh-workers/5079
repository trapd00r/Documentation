:That could be done, but when people subscribe or unsubscribe, the
:message must go to sunsite.auc.dk, and that is not very intuitive and
:I fear a lot of people will try to do administrative changes by
:posting to the main lists.

I can set up
  users-anythingblah@zsh.org to go to zsh-users-anythingblah@zsh.org
and others in about 60-70 seconds.

:Also, ezmlm keeps track of who is missing
:what messages, and if a message bounce due to temporary errors, it
:will notify the receiver about which messages he is messing - these
:messages will be numbered in the ezmlm-scheme.

There are also questions on what are the current "official" numbers:

The message went through both gatech and sunsite.auc so picked up two sets
of numbers.  Neither is more useful than the other.  gatech is now missing
messages that get sent straight to sunsite.auc.  sunsite.auc has announce
and users messages mixed in.

:So the best thing would be, if sunsite and the archive did agree on
:the numbering.

OK, well, if you're willing to make a small change to ezmlm-idx - which
won't affect your other lists; the change would allow sublists to have
more than one possible parent list - and you're also willing to make some
structural changes to the list setup - using five list hierarchies, not
three then, yes, a message to announce will have an announce number even
when sent to users or workers.  And a message to users will have a users
number when sent to workers.

I'll mail details later.
