Hi,

 I am currenlty experimenting with the coproc command.

 If I am doing the "hello world"-version of coproc:

	coproc bc
	noglob echo 3*6 >&p
	read a <&p; echo $a

 Everthing is working fine.

 But if I am doing:

	coproc bc
	rxvt zsh &

	( and then in the new shell
	noglob echo 3*6 >&p
	Bad file descriptor

 As I think to know (*VERY* carefully) beside other things the
 filedescriptors of a parent process are inherited to the child
 process.

 Why is the zsh started by rxvt started by the first zsh not able to
 use &>p ?

 keep zshing!
 Meino
