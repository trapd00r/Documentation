Wherever the completion system runs a command like ps to generate
matches, it checks the `command' style so that you can specify a
replacement command. So pick your command and set the style:

e.g.:

zstyle ':completion:*:processes' command 'ps -o pid,s,nice,stime,args'

If you only want to affect the kill command then:

zstyle ':completion:*:kill:*:processes' command 'ps -o pid,s,nice,stime,args'
