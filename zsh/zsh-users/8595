    Yes, you're right, but I couldn't think of a more apropriate
subject at the time, sorry O:)) Next time I'll use a better and more
descriptive subject.

    That's weird :(( I still have open the console where I saw that,
but in a new virtual console that doesn't happen and yes, I see
'Hellon' and not 'Hello'. I don't know why, because the options are
the same in both terminals (I've double checked that) :???

    On every new terminal I see 'Hellon'.

    So I must use something like:

    eval printf -- \"Hello\\n\"

    I forgot that the double quotes were removed :((( Is there any
way of seeing how a command line is parsed *just before* being
executed by the shell? That would avoid the stupidity from the user
(that is, me) you can see above O:) I've tried the eval command with
the double quotes quoted and works perfectly ;)

    Thanks a lot for answering, Bart, and my excuses for the poor
subject O:)
