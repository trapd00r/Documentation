} The way zsh treats illegal array indices is pretty ugly. It simply
} replaces indices which are 0 (with KSH_ARRAYS unset) or < -length by 1.
} This doesn't make much sense and can cause hard-to-detect errors.

I agree that this is counter-intuitive.

} c) Print an error message if an illegal index is used on the left      
} side of an assignment, return an empty value otherwise.

I believe this to be the best behavior.
