} - There are no completions for standard mail programmes or common
}   tools like elm and pine.

You'll note that _mailboxes can handle several such programs, though.
We just don't have a file containing the #compdef line to hook it up.

Of course there's more we *could* do ... even _mutt could, for example,
grovel alias names out of the apprpriate config file to complete in the
userhost state when there's no @ in the word yet.

} - There is no special handling user@domain instead of user@host.  This
}   can be done with contexts, but maybe it would be nicer to have some
}   special mail _user_at_host handling which allows pws@csr.com (where
}   csr.com doesn't appear in my normal hosts list for obvious reasons).

Hmm.  Is there anything else about the handling of domains that would be
distinct from hosts?
