Bart,

Eric De Mund <ead@ixian.com> to <zsh-workers@sunsite.dk>:
] Why do some ampersands placed after single-word commands jump one
] space to the left

Bart Schaefer <schaefer@brasslantern.com>:
] Actually it's ampersands (and vertical bars) typed immediately after
] words that were filled in by using completion which move as a result
] of the auto-removal of the previously auto-added trailing space.

Thank you; this is, indeed, when and only when it happens.

Is this behavior option-settable? It represents an aesthetic that I just
don't share; I strongly prefer a space character between commands and
any following &'s, &&'s, and ||'s.

Regards,
Eric
