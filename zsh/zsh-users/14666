That's a good suggestion.

I would have preferred to the '_complete_failed' approach better,
but there's no point if I *already* found a widget that breaks it.
I need something that can get me out every time.

The history completer is also nice to re-use old file names.

Thanks for all the suggestions.
Very appreciated.
