Aha!! I've tried it myself with zsh 3.02, and it works! So this is  
obviously a bug and I'm not as stupid as I was afraid I am... :-)

As far as I'm concerned, I'd love to do this, but the script will  
be published for the whole NEXTSTEP community and I can't build on  
something that's not a standard part of NEXTSTEP.

Anyway, thanks to this crazy workaround 1>&1 (can't believe I found  
that one!) it will work...

Thanks a lot!
