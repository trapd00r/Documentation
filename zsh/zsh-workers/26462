Reply-To: gak@klanderman.net
X-Mailer: VM 7.17 under 21.4 (patch 17) "Jumbo Shrimp" XEmacs Lucid

[~] greg@lwm| zsh -f
lwm% mkdir foo
lwm% touch foo/bar
lwm% touch foo/baz
lwm% autoload -U compinit
lwm% compinit
lwm% zstyle ':completion:*' accept-exact-dirs yes

Now try completing each of the following:

ls foo/                # OK
ls ~/foo/              # doesn't work - no completions
ls /home/greg/foo/     # OK
ls $HOME/foo/          # doesn't work - no completions

Now,

lwm% cd /tmp

and try those again:

ls ~/foo/              # OK
ls /home/greg/foo/     # OK
ls $HOME/foo/          # OK

thanks,
Greg
