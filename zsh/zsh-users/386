I thought zsh could do this, but I can't find the right combination of
options for it.  I don't actually like the bash behaviour, but we
really ought to be able to emulate it.  Whoever does add this
capability, be very careful -- the logic controlling when the list is
displayed is quite horrendous as it is.

Not as another special case.  But I have some vague plans for a more
general programmable completion mechanism that could allow this among
other things -- I'll post some specific designs (to zsh-workers) in a
few days or so.
