That's a reasonable idea, but it just means that we get a new, short,
file for every major version.

I think so, but it would be good to have more than just a list of names
in that case.  Just mention which areas each person has hacked, and in
which major versions.

I think the details of what you do with CONTRIBUTORS doesn't matter,
provided you (a) keep the existing credits in some form and (b) credit
recent developers in some way.

Wow, that means I was on-line before you were.  I was `around' on JaNet
(the British academic network) in 1988-1990 or so.  (Nothing like the
modern Internet, of course, but there was some semblance of a
connection to ARPANET.)
