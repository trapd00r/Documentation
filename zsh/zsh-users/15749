As has already been pointed out, assigning to $path alters the value of
$PATH, which makes it impossible to find any other executables.

One way to prevent yourself from getting into trouble with this:

    readonly path

Now you can still assign to PATH (and the new value is reflected in
the $path array), but you can't accidentally stomp on it via direct
assignment to path.
