Sorry for responding before actually testing, but after testing it
proves to be insufficient.  It simply ignores the = on the command line
now, restarting all completion instead of taking the = into account.
Say I have a directory with the file
	=README
in it (yes this is an Arch managed source tree) that I want to read with
vim. I thus type
	% vim =<tab>
which simply lists
	\=README
under 'files'.
Is there any way to solve this?  I mean, I'm glad my =<tab> doesn't
expand to thousands of commands, but it's still not that great.
