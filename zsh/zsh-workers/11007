Message-Id: <200004281240.OAA22300@beta.informatik.hu-berlin.de>
From: Sven Wischnowsky <wischnow@informatik.hu-berlin.de>
To: zsh-workers@sunsite.auc.dk
Subject: PATCH: yet another match-spec-cursor bug


With partial word matching and matches like `c6.yo' and `c6.yo.old',
the cursor was left on the dot. Caused by a thinko in the code that
marks the cline structs to say in which of them characters were
missing.


Bye
 Sven
