} I decided to change my script to reflect the copy of my shell, and attempt
} to direct it to the path of my zsh wrapper itself causes the script to
} misfire when it is executed from *csh.

And the error you get is something like "exec format error", I suppose.

Most (I don't know if I can say "all") operating systems won't do two
levels of indirection via #! lines.  That is, if the thing on the #!
line is not itself a binary in executable format, the OS will not
recognize yet another #! line and launch still another interpreter.

The workaround is to write your wrapper in C and compile it.
