In the case of signed, I disagree.  The signed keyword usually has no
effect at all, so #defining it to nothing makes almost no difference to
its meaning.  const, similarly, is purely a modifier, and #defining it
to nothing makes no difference to the meaning of the code, provided
it's legal to start with.  The EXTERN macro is uppercase because it
doesn't simply mean extern; it means extern in most source files, but
it is different in one.
