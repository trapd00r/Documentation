Yes, this seems to be the cause.  I had made the manual tweak of
commenting out the HAVE_DEV_PTMX define in config.h (as suggested by
Bart) in order to get rid of a hang in the tests, and reverting that
change on one of my two test systems does cause the early Y* tests to
start failing again.  Strangely, reverting this change on the other test
system I was using (which I did try last night) did not cause these
failures (just the aforementioned hang), so I had assumed that this
change was unrelated to the failures based on that.  Instead, it just
appears to affect different Linux setups differently.
