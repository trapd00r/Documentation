Doesn't quite solve the problem, it's too simple :-/.

Let me explain it this way:  Because of various things beyond my
control, my workstyle is to sit down at various times during the
day/night and do about half an hour of work.  After that half hour
it's really important I get up and stretch and walk around.  Imagine a
sort of body-wide tendancy to RSI.

What I want the computer to do is somehow "sense" when I'm using it
and tell me to get up and stretch.  Then to "know" when I have -
because if I haven't then it keeps telling me every minute to get up
until I do.  I mean 'tell' literally by the way - I use a voice synth
:).

At the moment it's a perl script that parses the output of 'finger
@localhost' but that just grabs it from /var/wtmp.  I haven't been
bothered to write a module to access wtmp directly.
