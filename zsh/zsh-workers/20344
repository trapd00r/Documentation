How about this?

    zstyle () {
        [[ $3 = matcher-list ]] && {
            zle -R "Trying completion for $2"
            sleep 1
        }
        builtin zstyle "$@"
    }

I don't think there's a sifficiently low-level loop that's common to all
completions.  You could try hooking into _wanted or _tags, I suppose.

Using zle -R instead of -M takes care of that.  Is there some other bad
side-effect of -R?
