} For the record, both versions of vi that I know of that have tildeop

Aha.  I've never used nvi, and I never realized vim had it (and I probably
wouldn't have left it set it if I did realize it, especially with THAT
behavior; vim's other "improvements" on vi's region commands are already
enough to annoy me, though they're not as bad as elvis's.)

Nevertheless, it probably should work like the vi variants that have it.
Please ignore my patch.
