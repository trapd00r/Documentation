You're correct that the Cygwin version isn't the same as native NT
(2000, XP).  However, the changes to compile natively under Windows are
substantial and Cygwin have done most of the work for us.  Furthermore,
you won't get very far with any of the supplied functions without a set
of Unix tools, and they assume Unix file name semantics.  In short,
Cygwin is almost certainly your best bet.

As far as I know the older zsh that ran natively under Windows isn't
being maintained.

By the way, the changes for Mac are enough that I will produce 4.2.3.
Most people should be satistified with 4.2.2.
