Can I suggest your professors were either very weird or (more likely)
didn't do much real programming?  You're suggesting (i) that they
couldn't see from

#define THIS_DEFINITION 0x0080

that the next one is obviously

#define THAT_DEFINITION 0x0100

which I don't believe (ii) that they are happy when debugging, given a
set of bits 0x09e1 (or whatever), to deduce that this includes (1<<11),
(1<<8), (1<<7), (1<<6), (1<<5) and (1<<0)?  In that case, please could
they do more zsh debugging, because given 0x09e1 I need definitions that
separate out into 0x0800, 0x0100, 0x0080, 0x0040, 0x0020 and 0x0001 so
that I can work out what the flags are.  I wrote the latter ones out
straight away but had to think for a long time about the former ones.
