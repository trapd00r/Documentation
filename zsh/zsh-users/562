In case anyone cares, I have a version of zsh 3.0.2 compiled for the
BeBox at:

  ftp://ftp.cts.com/pub/pjf/bezsh302pl0.gz

It seems to work (minus job control), although I've barely tested it.
I'm going to be gone all next week, so I don't have time to do anything
else with it right now.  Enjoy.

All my life I said I wanted to be someone...I can see now that I should have
been more specific.
