Subject: get the list of completions immediately

Hi,

consider the following example:

  % ls
  abc_one abc_two abc_three
  % echo a<TAB>

now I have:

  % echo abc_

and if I press tab one more time I see the possible completions.

What do I have to do to see the completions right after I pressed
tab the first time?

Thank you.
