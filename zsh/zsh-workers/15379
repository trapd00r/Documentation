I've been thinking about this ever since we added correction to the
completion system...  There's another problem, namely: where to make it
try correction.  After each word, but what exactly is a word here.  And
what about things like `../$foo/bar' -- it might be that it's the `$foo'
that really should be `Foo' or whatever.

Very complicated that.
