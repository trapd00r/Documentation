Yes, if the option NOMATCH is set, as it is by default.  It is supposed
to abort the entire sequence of commands, because it is designed to
detect errors.

You have to turn it off and detect whether the expansion took place.

setopt nonomatch
EDITOR==emacs
[[ $EDITOR = =* ]] || EDITOR==vi

Or many possibly equivalents.

The latest version of the shell allows you to do

{ EDITOR==emacs 2>/dev/null } always { TRY_BLOCK_ERROR=0 } || EDITOR==vi

but it's hardly worth it in a case like this.
