You might want to take a look at the prompt theme system supplied with 4.0
onward.  It's described in the zshcontrib manual page.  The functions live
in the Functions/Misc directory of the source code and are probably
installed somewhere under /usr/local/shar/zsh/<version>/functions.

If nothing there fits, you should be able to add your own prompt theme
along the lines of one of the existing ones, which could be added to the
distribution.
