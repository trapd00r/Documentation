You can't specify a different description for the second group (after
`--'). Only other completion options like suffixes.

That would work if you specify a different tag for the two sets of
completions:
  _describe -t fruits fruit rts
  _describe -t animals animal srts

Otherwise, both fruits and animals are added with the tag `values'. It
is the tag rather than the description which determines the grouping of
matches.
