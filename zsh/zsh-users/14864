There is a problem with Cygwin 1.7 owing to lack of support for Unix-style
hard links.  There was some discussion in December in the thread "Unable to
read history on latest Cygwin" on both the -users and -workers lists (see
http://www.zsh.org/mla/).  I'm not sure if this is related to what you're
seeing, but it might be.  There's no definitive patch for this at the
moment.
