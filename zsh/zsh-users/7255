[I'm using zsh 4.2.0, compiled for cygwin, running on WinXP SP1]

When I invoke vared on a variable that doesn't exist, the shell crashes with
the following:

      3 [main] zsh 1948 handle_exceptions: Exception:
STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION
   5599 [main] zsh 1948 open_stackdumpfile: Dumping stack trace to
zsh.exe.stackdump

It also occurs with `zsh -f'.


(I initially tried sending this to zsh-workers, but when I replied to the
qconfirm message it kept bouncing.)
