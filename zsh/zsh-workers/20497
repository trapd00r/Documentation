Hm.

- It requires a writable directory rather than merely a writable histfile.
  Perhaps fall back to the old behavior if the directory is not writable?
  Similarly, perhaps detect when the histfile is a symlink and fall back?

- You haven't tested for failure of unlink() [though I'm not sure what the
  response to such failure would be ... except see below about O_EXCL].

- You haven't tested for failure of rename() -- and note that rename() may 
  falsely report failure in the event of certain NFS errors.

I wasn't aware of that latter; it should be changed.  Using the PID as a 
disambiguator is also not safe when NFS is involved (two shells with the 
same PID on different hosts may be accessing the histfile in the same 
NFS-mounted home directory at the same time, unlikely as that seems).

At the very least you should be open()ing with O_EXCL, and be prepared to 
recover if that fails (although O_EXCL is not reliable over NFS).

No, that'd definitely be worse (even more likely to have conflict when 
multiple shells are rewriting the history), not better.
