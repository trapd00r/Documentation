I'd say
ls **/*(.)
is much easier than
find . -type f -exec ls {} \;
You just need a little bit of experience with zsh's extended globbing.
(I hardly use find any more)

YMMV :)

[lots of "x x x x "]
jean-luc@picard (tty11) ~> /bin/echo $(repeat 32767 echo -n  "x " )
zsh: argument list too long: /bin/echo

Ah, the limit is at 32766 arguments. (On Linux-i386)
Here's the few situations where I need find again... :)

Question to zsh-workers (Cc-ed):
Is there a special reason why only 32766 arguments are allowed? (that
is, 32766+1, the executable name, so - an unsigned short seems to be
used for counting the arguments - why not an int? Would be 2147483646
arguments on Linux)
(I currently don't read zsh-workers, so please Cc me or zsh-users if you
reply to this question. thanks)

CU,
Thomas
