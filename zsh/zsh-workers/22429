There's a subtle bug in the code to support multibyte patterns.  If a
path includes a segment which is specially handled, so that it doesn't
exist in the directory but springs into existence when referenced, you
can't use it in a pattern.  I found this when looking at the ".snaphost"
directory of a Netapp file server, which contains backups of recent
versions of files.
