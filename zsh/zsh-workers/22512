I'm not entirely certain this patch is a good idea.  It doesn't
really hurt to have a completer offer things like command-line
options for the latest version of a program, but to complete a
file that an older version won't know what to do with is a bit
worse.

What proportion of zsh users can be expected to have the latest
version of tar?  There is not one single machine where I use zsh
where this completion would be correct, because all of them have
GNU tar but the latest is 1.14.10 (and most are much older).
