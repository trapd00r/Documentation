    Hi all :)

    Just a note:

 * DervishD <zsh@dervishd.net> dixit:

    I can understand the first case, but I don't understand the last
one: in the first case, what I misunderstood is that the shell quotes
the chars, producing "[\]" and "print" prints them, interpreting some
escape directives: "[]". But in the last case, nothing should then be
printed, because zsh quotes the backslash and "print" gets a single
backslash, that is, an empty escape directive that shouldn't print
anything :? Is "print" assuming that a single backslash is not an
empty escape directive? Is a single, isolated backslash a synonim for
"\\"?
