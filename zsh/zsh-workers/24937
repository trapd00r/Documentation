I should add that the patched glob in configure.ac is incorrect, but it
works because of the way the port selectively applies the patch.  The
correct glob would be something like:

  *openbsd*|*freebsd5*|*freebsd6[012]*)

FreeBSD 4 and older are no longer supported, so I won't bother trying to
make them work properly.

It didn't occur to me earlier that with this change, the patch could be
applied unconditionally.
