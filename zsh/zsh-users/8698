    Hi Eric :)

    Quick'n'dirty hack (obviously must exist a better solution):

    mutt eric `for file in * ; print -- -a $file' -s ...

    The main problem is that this doesn't work with files that has
spaces in the name. If mutt doesn't need a space between '-a' and the
file name for the attach, you can do this:

    mutt eric "`for file in * ; print -- -a $file'" -s ...

    This quotes the space between the '-a' and the filename. I don't
know of any other solution that you can use in the command line. If
you need selective quoting you can 'build' the command line:

    commandline=(mutt eric)
    for file in *
    do
        commandline+=(-a "$file")
    done
    commandline+=(-s "all...")
    
    After that, you run this:
    $ $commandline </dev/null

    Hope that helps :)
