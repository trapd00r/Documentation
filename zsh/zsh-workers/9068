Currently (well... a week ago, and a week is a long time in completion), if
you set ZLS_COLORS and use completion, ZLS_COLORS gets stomped on.  I was
suggesting that compinit might instead save it as the list-colors default,
if that's not already set; this can of course be overridden.  (It's nice
that styles don't care whether or not the module they refer to has been
initialised, unlike assoc arrays.)
