Subject: Mandrake 8.0 - compinit in /etc/zshrc
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=KOI8-R; format=flowed
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

I wanted to use versioned .zcompdump (home dir is shared between systems 
with different zsh versions) in .zshrc: compinit -d 
~/.zcompdump.${ZSH_VERSION}. To my surpsise, plain .zcompdump was still 
created. It turned out a call in /etc/zshrc.

I am not exactly happy about it ... one reason is above; the other one, 
should distribution unconditionally force user to use new completion?

Here is relevant part from /etc/zshrc:

# Completion functions
_compdir=/usr/share/zsh/$ZSH_VERSION/functions/Completion
[[ -z $fpath[(r)$_compdir] ]] && fpath=($fpath $_compdir)
autoload -U compinit
compinit
