How do i get the append history thing to work?
I've added this to my .zshrc:
HISTFILE=~/.zshistory
setopt appendhist

and tried pretty much anything you can do with these..btw is HISTSIZE in
lines or kb?

And another thing, how do i get the history-beginning-search or whatever
they're called to move the cursor to the end of the line after finding a
match?

And one last question, is there any possibility to bind a regular command
to an key sort of like: bindkey '^K' history
