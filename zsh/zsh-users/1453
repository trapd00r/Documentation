This form was always documented as working only on the names of existing
files.  In prior versions there was special-case code to allow modifiers
to be applied to any string without performing globbing, but in the
glob changes for 3.1.2-zefram4 I simplified things a bit by making this
actually invoke globbing.  A side effect is that things like "foo(M)"
now work as expected.

You can get the effect you want -- applying modifiers to an arbitrary
string -- via parameter expansion: "echo ${${:-foo.bar}:r}" has always
been the correct way to do this.
