First: I have 2.4.19pre1 with glibc 2.2.4, too, on my laptop and it
works fine.

I once had a similar problem on that Digital Unix box.  It turned out
that for some reason a /dev/ptyXX was free but the corresponding
/dev/ttyXX was not writable by anyone else than root.  That made
get_pty() fail, of course.

Maybe we should change that function to re-try /dev/pty's in that
case?  Haven't seen that problem anywhere else, though.


Bye
  Sven
