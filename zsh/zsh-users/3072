You can fix that by going into the user configuration and giving yourself
a home directory.  (On NT, that is; I'm not sure of the 95/98 equivalent.)
I usually pick the directory where NT has already stashed all my personal
.INI files and the like, which I believe is under "Program Files" somewhere
(it's been a while since I set this up).
