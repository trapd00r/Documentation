I don't, and never have, understood signal handling, I just rewrote the
trap handling rather minimally to implement localtraps, and have simplified
it at least twice since then, so it probably needs it again.  If you can
find a particular chunk of code which seems to be doing something wrong
(shorter than the complete traps test) I'll have a look at it sometime.
