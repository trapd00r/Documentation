I've committed this, but in principle you can have a global alias for
anything, even a quoted expression; it might be better to have the shell
save and restore the state of the noaliases option for the dumpfile,
something like:


integer aliases
{
[[ -o aliases ]] && aliases=1
setopt noaliases

...

} always {
  (( aliases )) && setopt aliases
}


It's a pity this isn't easier in a dot file.
