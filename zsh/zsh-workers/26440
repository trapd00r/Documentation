Have you looked at the "kill" completions?  It already does basically
what you are trying to do.. here are some style settings that may be
useful:

zstyle ':completion:*' select-prompt ""
zstyle ':completion:*' select-scroll -2
zstyle ':completion:*:*:kill:*' verbose yes
zstyle ':completion:*:*:kill:*' insert-ids longer
zstyle ':completion:*:*:kill:*:processes' command "ps $( (($UID == 0)) && echo a)uxwh"

I prefer to set insert-ids to single, but that breaks menu-select.
I have a fix I'll be submitting soon.

Yes, menu-select:

zmodload -i zsh/complist
bindkey '\M-\t' 'menu-select'
