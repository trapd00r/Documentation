Hm. What exactly doesn't seem to work properly for you anymore? The
only ugliness I can see is that you get the `\(' if the string is not
in quotes but when it is. Why not use:

  compadd -s '(' -S '' - ...

or

  local suf='('
  compquote suf
  compadd -qS "$s" - ...

and if the `compset -q' is really needed, put it after the compquote.

I don't really know all the things that are possible with -remote,
though, so these suggestions may not be usable(?).

Bye
 Sven
