Nope, but it doesn't hurt much.  'env' execs, AFAIK, so it's only an 
extra (light) process startup.  Mainly I was lazy.

Accidentally wrote it as:

&& exec doinglogging=true screen ...

Didn't work, since I'd put the precmd modifiers in the wrong order, and 
I tacked on 'env' instead of rearranging.
