Here's another patch necessary for my input code: in this case, I
hadn't realised that join() maintains it's own memory and you
shouldn't free what it returns.  This was in the code for `eval'.  The
symptom is typically that the next PATH assignment after an eval will
give a message about a bad free (if you are using zsh's allocators
with checks enabled).
