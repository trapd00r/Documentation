I think the section called COMPLETION SYSTEM CONFIGURATION in the
zshcompsys manual should have everything you need.  The separate items
give the descriptions of each of the colon-separated fields.  It's a bit
light on examples until it puts it all together (around
":completion::complete:dvips:option-o-1:files").  Otherwise, ask a more
specific question.
