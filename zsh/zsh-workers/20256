Based on the change you made, I'd say it was a problem with your $PS1
setting, not with the colors package.

This is definitely not correct.  The color values set up by the colors 
package are meant to be used in a number of places other than prompts 
(despite the comment to the effect that prompt themse use them).  If you 
use the color values in your prompt, you should use the %{ and %} around 
them, but the prompt delimiters do not belong in the colors package.
