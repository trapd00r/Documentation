While we are on the subject of history...  I seem to remember from using a
version of ksh way back when, that it was possible to set it up so that you
can share history between multiple ttys.  So if I typed a command in one
window, I could retrieve and execute it from another window.  

I imagine there is some overhead for doing this, since I believe that it was
just done by maintaining one common history file that was updated after each
command.  But it was really quite useful since it reduces the need to cut
and paste and is especially useful for retrieving those long, interesting
commands when you log on from a different machine. 

Is it currently possible to do something like this in zsh?  If not, are
there plans to support it in the future?

Herb.
