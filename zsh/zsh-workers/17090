Sounds quite reasonable.  It might make it more difficult to handle
problems with include file location and dependencies on other modules,
but that's currently not all that robust.  Possibly the directory
structure could reflect this, dependencies living in higher directories.
(Doesn't help multiple dependencies, though.)

It would be neatest if it were possible to add an new module and add its
tools without regenerating the whole set, i.e. looping over separate
configure files rather than appending them to the main one.

Subdirectories ought to be subdirectories of Modules, not directly of
Src.  I don't know what would happen with Zle.
