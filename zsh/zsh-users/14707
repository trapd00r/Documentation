 Hello,

 As mentioned before (http://www.cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2008-12/msg00105.html)
completion of mixed-style paths (e.g. "c:/Win<TAB>") when using new style
completions stopped to work somewhere between 4.3.4 and 4.3.9 under Cygwin.
I thought that this message http://www.zsh.org/mla/workers/2009/msg00997.html
implied that it was fixed but apparently I misunderstood it as after just
rebuilding zsh from cvs (well, git to be precise, but it does include the
patch from the message above) I still can't complete paths using drive
letters.

 I also tried using "zstyle ':completion:*' accept-exact-dirs true"
mentioned in http://www.zsh.org/mla/users/2009/msg00656.html but it doesn't
help with "c:/" completion. I did (semi-accidentally) discovered that it
allows to complete "c://" normally. But I'm not sure if I can train myself
to type two slashes... It would be nice if this were not necessary (and
neither were zstyle itself so that this could work by default).

 So did I really misunderstand Peter's message to zsh-workers list and the
patch there wasn't supposed to fix this problem? Or is it really supposed
to work by default (and just doesn't)? 

 TIA,
VZ
