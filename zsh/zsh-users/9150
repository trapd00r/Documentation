I am a little confused here -- seems that what I believed to know
previously is wrong...

...I am booting my linux box directly into an X-Server with a kdm
login...The shell I start then is...interactively, right? .zshrc
setopts my extendedglob...then I start a script from there...which
again is not interactively...and will "loose" some features I set in
my .zshrc...

Is this correct?

Is there a list where I can identify those features, which are not
valid for scripts, if set in .zshrc? Or do I have to read through the
whole zshall manpage?

Meino
