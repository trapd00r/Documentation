I agree that in the end we should have configure tests for all this,
but for this example (`_rpm') I wouldn't have the slightest idea how
to test (other then testing if `rpm' is available). I wasn't even sure 
if `Linux' is ok. Maybe it should be put in `Redhat'. Or `Linux/Redhat'.
Or `User/Linux/Redhat', next to `User/Linux/Debian'.

Also: what if this is installed in a heterogeneous network where the
sysadmin installs `/usr/local/lib/zsh/...' (or something like that)
from a Solaris box but there are also Linux boxes in the net?

I think I would prefer to leave that to run-time configuration (on a
per-user or per-/etc/zsh* basis). With a good package-system, that
is. With packages and sub-packages, and...

Bye
 Sven
