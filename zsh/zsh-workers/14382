There's a typo here --- using CONDF_* flags instead of MFF_* flags.
Actually that doesn't change anything because they're both defined to 2,
so that's not the real problem.

What's happening is simple enough --- addmathfunc adds the `added' flag
straight away, which is what is tested to see if the function was
autoloaded, so this is screwy.  Probably add_automathfunc() shouldn't be
allowing addmathfunc() to add the MFF_ADDED flag, it should be done when
the module is loaded.  The following seems to work.
