Am I missing something, or isn't this the canonical case for using 
associative arrays?

e.g., the first thing that came to mind:

[0]$ find master backup

master
master/foo bar baz
master/something
master/[has-a-brack

backup
backup/!@#%$@%
backup/another@thing
backup/something
backup/[has-a-brack

[1]$ diff -ur =(cd master ; ls) =(cd backup ; ls)
--- /tmp/zshotlEqg      2009-05-06 00:15:05.984375000 -0400
+++ /tmp/zshEysrph      2009-05-06 00:15:06.062500000 -0400
@@ -1,3 +1,4 @@
+!@#%$@%
 [has-a-brack
-foo bar baz
+another@thing
 something

[2]$ MASTER=( master/**/*(.:s.master/.) )
[3]$ BACKUP=( backup/**/*(.:s.backup/.) )
[4]$ typeset -A _master
[5]$ for l in $MASTER ; _master[$l]=true
[6]$ REMOVE=() ; for l in $BACKUP ; [ -z $_master[$l] ] && REMOVE+=($l)
[7]$ print -r rm $REMOVE
rm !@#%$@% another@thing

There's probably even a better way to write the line marked [4], too.
