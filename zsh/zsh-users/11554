Yes, I knew 'execute-named-cmd'. I meant the latter. Thanks for
clarifying.

So, .widgetname always calls the original widget. That is really
helpful. Thanks for mentioning it. :-)
I always created some differently named widget and rebound the original
key, which is kind of a PITA, if you don't know to which key the
original widget may have been bound to.

Okay.

Again, something new (for me). I'll look into these.
