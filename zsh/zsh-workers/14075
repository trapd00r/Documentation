It should (still) be possible to just reverse-apply four mentioned patches
(actually, there were three, and one unposted, but it was one line change.
Of course, unposted cvs commits make it harder to unapply them). At this
time patch applied cleanly with one line fuzz in termcap.mdd (I believe).
I actually meant, that I cannot just use cvs update currently because it
will reapply the patches again.

With everyone's consent I'll try to backout them again on up-to-date cvs
and commit it.
