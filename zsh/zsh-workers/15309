This works very nicely, with one exception.
If I'm trying to complete an executable in the current directory, e.g.
         % setu<TAB>
it will give me neither "setup", nor "setup.exe".  This is logical, because 
the special .exe handling is only for the PATH hash.

Would you know a workaround for that?

Thanks,

  - Michael

(Wouldn't it be nice if Cygwin did this foo.exe -> foo handling 
automagically for us?)
