Well, at least, I would if I knew how to...

Next problem: rpm allows single letter switches to be grouped, but
_rpm doesn't recognise this, e.g.

% rpm -ihv <TAB>

doesn't complete .rpm files.

Presumably the -s of _arguments will help here, but how do you use it
without mucking up all the long options?  Two separate calls to
_arguments?
