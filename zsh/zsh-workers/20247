I've been using the patch from workers/16598 for a long time now and it's 
a lot better than the behavior without it, but as Sven "where have you 
gone, Joe DiMaggio" Wischnowski wrote in that article, the fix remains
imperfect.  The discussion died off after Oliver's remarks in 16659.

Should we just commit the 16598 patch and leave it at that?  Or is Oliver
feeling ambitious?
