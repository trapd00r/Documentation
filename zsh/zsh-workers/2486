The cursor keys will then work, but if you press <ESC> there will be a
delay, while zsh waits for the rest of an escape sequence, before
vi-cmd-mode gets executed.  I am of the opinion that key-generated
escape sequences are a bad idea in general, for this reason.

One better: I don't use cursor keys at all.  Their behaviour is too
inconsistent to rely on them.  (The terminals that I regularly use
don't generate ANSI escape sequences, so they wouldn't work in ZLE.)

Yes.  There is a case to be made for binding the cursor keys, but ...

you *can* bind them manually if you want them, so I think we should
default to the better vi emulation.

Only people that don't read the manual.
