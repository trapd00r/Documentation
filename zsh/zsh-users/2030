} If I type in a command and press enter, then press ^C to halt
} the command, the line typed doesn't go into the history buffer.

That's odd.  If one types ^C -before- pressing enter, then the line won't
go into the history, but in my experience as soon as enter is pressed the
line is in the history.

Can you send a snippet of session transcript showing this in action?
