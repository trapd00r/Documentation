Mikael -- that seems like overkill... Is there something particularly 
useful about all of the "\\"- and quoted-or-not logic?

I get roughly what the OP was asking for by simply setting:

WORDCHARS='*?_-.[]~&;!#$%^(){}<>'

in my ~/.zshenv.

The important bit is that '/' is not present in my preferred WORDCHARS 
list, but it is in the default list.  ('.' is another one that seems to be 
commonly omitted, in order to backspace to the '.'s in domain names/IP 
addresses or file.extensions.)

Best,
Ben
