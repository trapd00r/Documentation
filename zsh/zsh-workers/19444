For a brief time I was seeing these tests fail on a debian sarge system,
but after making some unrelated code changes (to zsh.h, which caused all
programs to be recompiled), the problem went away (even if I revert my
unrelated changes).  Weird.  I wonder if something hadn't gotten
rebuilt?  You might try doing a "make clean", rebuild, and see if the
problem persists.
