You mean that in command position you want to complete file names from the 
current directory, even when the current directory is not in the path?

If that's what you mean, then look at Oliver K's last message in the 
"completion within word" thread that took place over just the last few 
days, or take Atom's advice.

If that isn't what you mean, you'll have to explain more fully.
