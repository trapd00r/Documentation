} the shell locks up for about ten seconds, recurring into every
} directory of the kernel tree doing *something*.  Finally,
} it comes back with `make menuconfig'.

It's running "make -nsp --no-print-directory -f Makefile .PHONY" to cause
make itself to output the list of possible completions.  I don't know why
this would be taking 10 seconds or more -- it finishes in 1 second or so
on my machine.
