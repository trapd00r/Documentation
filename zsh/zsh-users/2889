[Sorry, a little off topic]

> What is mmv?
It's a free tool from Usenet and can be called as
 mmv, mcp, mad or mln

I installed it as a Debian Package.  You can get it (and the source) from
here:  http://www.debian.org/Packages/unstable/utils/mmv.html

And here's the README, or better Copyright:


This is the Debian GNU/Linux prepackaged version of mmv.

This package was put together by Michael Meskes <meskes@debian.org>,
from sources obtained from USENET.

Copyright (c) 1989 Vladimir Lanin

Mmv is freeware. That means that the entire package of software and
documentation is copyrighted, and may not be distributed with any
modifications or for any charge (without the author's explicit written
permission). Other than that, it may be used and distributed freely.

However, Vladimir told me:

Michael,

This message is to serve as an announcement that I am changing the
copyright of mmv to GPL.

If this message is in any way insufficient to do so, please tell me what
I have to do. Please keep in mind that I do not have in hand either the
full GPL text or the source code of the last mmv release (oops).

If there is any other way that I can help out, please tell me.

Thanks,

Vladimir Lanin

Thanks to Joost for getting into touch with him.

Hope that helps,
 Andy.
