Yes, I can believe that's wrong...  Presumably it's also wrong in
signames.c.

The problem must be in signames2.awk which generates this:

    printf "#define sigmsg(sig) ((sig) <= SIGCOUNT ? sig_msg[sig] : %c%s%c)", 34, "unknown signal", 34

My guess is your awk is truncating the input line in some weird way.
(It can't be 80 characters, however, since you wouldn't get the `unknown
signal' at all.)  Can you try altering that line as per the following
patch and see if that helps?

If your awk is playing up, you might find other weirdness, in particular
the `# ifdef USE_SUSPENDED' bit in signames.c.  So even if it looks like
it works it would be worth checking (or posting) the resulting signames.c.
Any fixes ought to be similarly trivial, but I wouldn't like to second
guess what awk is actually getting up to.
