In thinking about the vi mode display question asked recently on zsh-users,
it occurs to me that zle-select-keymap should probably always be invoked
either immediately before or immediately after zle-line-init (I'm not sure
which would make more sense).

After all, zle is selecting a keymap when it initializes, and it may not
be the same keymap as when the last send-break or accept-line (et al.)
was invoked.
