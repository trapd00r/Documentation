I think you should have done it, anyway.  I'll explain
why in a second.

Beginners don't need "simple".  They need "practical".
Would you tell some chump off the street:

    This is how to jab;
    This is a hook;
    This is an uppercut;
    Now go fight Mike Tyson.

Clearly, this guy is going to be unprepared for the task at hand.  

That's why a long practical example that explains the task of writing a
completion function from start to finish would have been helpful.
