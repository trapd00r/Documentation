OK, I accidently killed my old source, but have reapplied patches
2865(me), 2956(Bart), 2957(Zoltan) to 3.0.3-test4
I didn't apply 2866(2868) because I assumed 2956 superceded it.
Does anyone know if there were any others?  Is it in your Changelog, Zoltan?

:With `termok = TERM_BAD' in effect, I was able to set COLUMNS=2 without

I think the bugs are avoided at the moment with the patches Bart/I have done,
but I'll check anyway.
