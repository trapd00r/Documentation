Don't know what you mean, but IFS= is necessary even with zsh,
and the behavior is POSIX in every shell AFAICT, could you
please expand.

$ echo '  a  ' | read -r
$ echo "<$REPLY>"
<a>
$ echo '  a  ' | IFS= read -r
$ echo "<$REPLY>"
<  a  >

zsh also has:

IFS=$'\n\n' read -rAd '' argv
argv=("${(@)argv[1,-2]}")
for i do
  print -r -- $i
done

Or to loop over non-empty lines:

for i in ${(f)"$(cat filename)"}; do
  print -r -- $i
done

Myself, I go for

@lines = <>;

or 

while (<>)

or

perl -ne '...'
