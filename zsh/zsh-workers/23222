I've committed this bit.

This ought to be fixed by a patch from Wayne that's almost a year old:

2006-03-27  Wayne Davison  <wayned@users.sourceforge.net>

	* SF bug #1262954: Src/jobs.c: fixed a compilation problem
	when HAVE_GETRUSAGE is defined but HAVE_WAIT3 is not.

I'm hoping to produce a new version soon, but I'm struggling to fix some
stuff to do with quoting in completion, which is very hairy, so soon
may not be very soon.
