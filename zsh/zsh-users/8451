Because that calls echo with FOO=BAR in its environment, it's
not echo that expands "$FOO", it's the shell.

You can do:

FOO=BAR eval '/bin/echo "$FOO"'

Here, it's eval that expands "$FOO", so it makes sense to put
FOO=BAR in its /environment/.

(note that with POSIX shells (and zsh in sh emulation), it's
FOO=BAR command eval '/bin/echo "$FOO"'
otherwise $FOO retains its value even after the eval).
