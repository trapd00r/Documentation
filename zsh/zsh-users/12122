It doesn't seem to show anything peculiar - it indicates that I (a
domain user) have full permissions and (I think) that these permissions
are inherited:
  CITRITE\johnc:F
  CITRITE\johnc:(OI)(CI)(IO)F

It also shows that Domain Users (and also "Everyone") have some special
read permissions:
  CITRITE\Domain Users:(special access:)
                                                      READ_CONTROL
                                                      FILE_READ_EA
=20
FILE_READ_ATTRIBUTES

I'll take a look later on my home machine (not in a domain) to see if
the problem occurs there - I suspect it won't.

Now we're on to something.  The directory is conspicuously missing
a 'w' for user permissions, but its permissions list ends in a '+',
which means overriding ACLs are in effect that mean that the
permissions on the directory can't really be mapped to simple user,
group, and other permissions.  Maybe you're only allowed to create
certain types of files in that directory, or something similar.
I dunno, I'm not really a windows person.  In any event, try running

cacls "`cygpath -w /c/Users/johnc.CITRITE/Documents`"

and seeing if the output tells you anything interesting about the ACLs
in effect.  After all, there has to be some reason why cygwin doesn't
think that you have full write permissions to that directory.
