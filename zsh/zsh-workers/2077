}   Do you, Zoltan, or does anyone else know where I can find explicit

} any information.  I'm asking permission of the FSF to use the bit of
} color_ls in zsh, but we need to let them know the distribution policy.

Before you go through that hassle, perhaps we should have (a) a statement
from Zoltan on whether he thinks the patches are worth including in the
first place, and (b) a discussion on zsh-workers about that statement.

I, for one, find this to be complete fluff and would just as soon skip it.
