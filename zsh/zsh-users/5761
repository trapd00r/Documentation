Hi all,

I use /dev/stderr in my scripts profusely.  Now that I
started using cygwin, these scripts would generally
fail.  I understand that Bash has built in /dev/*
handling for cygwin, is there any plans for ZSh to
develop similar features?

What's the best way for me to handle this without
modifying all of my scripts?

Thanks.
