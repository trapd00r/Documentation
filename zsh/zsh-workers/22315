I've uploaded 4.3.2; it just fixes two compilation problems noticed in
4.3.1, so if you already have 4.3.1 there's no big reason to upgrade.

Next, we have to start work on multibyte support in the rest of the
shell.

(I'll change the version number in the archive to 4.3.2-dev-1 to avoid
confusion with the release.)
