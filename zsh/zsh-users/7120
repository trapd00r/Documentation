Sorry, I put that rather badly.  You are *not* supposed to turn those on
on AIX, --enable-cap in particular since --enable-pcre was not a
particular problem for AIX.  --enable-cap is there so that if you leave
it turned off the shell should compile on AIX, just missing that module
(which isn't required for normal use).

Turning it on is at your own risk.  I am more than happy to include
patches which make it work, but without direct access I don't see
any likelihood of getting it to work myself.
