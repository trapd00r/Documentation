With latest CVS:

./C02cond.ztst: starting.
Test ./C02cond.ztst failed: bad status 1, expected 0 from:
  sleep 1
  cat unmodified
  touch newnewnew
  if [[ $OSTYPE == "cygwin" ]]; then
    print -u8 "Warning: not testing [[ -N file ]] (not supported on Cygwin)"
    true
  else
    [[ -N newnewnew && ! -N unmodified ]]
  fi
Was testing: -N cond
./C02cond.ztst: test failed.

Could this be because the compile is happening on an NFS-mounted
drive?
