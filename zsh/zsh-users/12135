Okay, I've done some more experimenting (including setting the
variables to arrays and other things) and discovered that a big
problem is that when the filenames get through to the tar command,
they are quoted, and thus the tilde does not expand.  I've tried using

${(Q)<array name>}

To remove the quotes, but they are still quoted in the trace:

+/home/joel/bin/backup:48> TOBACKUP=( '~/ado' '~/data' '~/docs' '~/svn_repo' '~/Mail' '~/News' '~/lisp' '~/office-directory' '~/.emacs' '~/.emacs-custom.el' ) 

How do I completely remove the quotes for when I invoke the command?

Thanks,
Joel
