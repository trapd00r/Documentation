Subject: Misc. zmodload and keymap stuff
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

"bindkey -M newkeymap nonexistent" gives the error message
	bindkey: no such keymap `newkeymap'
when in fact it's the nonexistent keymap that is the problem.

It'd be nice if there were an option to zmodload to have it report what
builtins/mathfuncs/keymaps/etc. are defined by a given module (only after
the module is loaded).

There's no documentation for the zsh/datetime module?
