My name is Martin Streicher, and I am the "Open Source" editor at 
APress Books (www.apress.com). I would like to consider a book on ZSH 
and am looking for authors and proposals for the book. In many ways, 
the book would be like the seminal csh and bash books, but since ZSH is 
much more extensible (globbing, auto-expanstion), I can see there being 
much more to the book that just how to write scripts, aliases, etc.

Please contact me, either individually or as a concerted effort, about 
such a book.

My background is technical; I have a MSCS from Purdue and worked on the 
guts of csh for longer than I care to admit.

I look forward to your reply.

Martin
