What does ksh93 provide in the way of associative array functionality?
(I don't have it installed at work, so I can't look it up right not.)

I'm not suggesting that ksh93 is always right about everything, but it
would surely be a good starting point, and a zsh which contained ksh93
as a subset would be much more convenient than having gratuitous
syntactic differences.  Except in those places where ksh93 is just
wrong, of course.
