o      specifies how the names of the files should be sorted.
              if d, files in subdirectories appear before those
              in  the  current  directory at each level of the search
-- this is best com-
              bined with other criteria, for example `odon' to sort=20
on  names  for files
              within  the  same  directory.

I think that is what you want, but i'm not sure with that description :)
ie, print -l **/*(.,odL)

--=20
