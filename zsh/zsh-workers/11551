No, without a `->state' spec no variables have to make local in the
calling function. Why should you need it, _arguments doesn't give
control back to the caller to handle actions in such cases.

-C was added when we were still struggling to learn the ways of the
contexts... yes, maybe we should make it the default, but I'm probably 
getting a bit tired to yet again change lots of functions. Maybe
someone else finds the time? ;-)
