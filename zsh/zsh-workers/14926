Yes, it seems to be that patch.  The farthest I've got is that the test is
executing zpty and is hung waiting for the result.  That process seems to
be blocking on a read from ptyread.  Does this mean anything to anyone?  It
doesn't to me.

The zpty stuff may well be a read herring and something is going on in a
completion function.  But I haven't yet followed the logic of who's doing what
to whom.
