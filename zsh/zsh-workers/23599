Hi list!

Consider the following:

[snip]
  % alias -s ogg='ogg123'
  % /mnt/audio/music/S/Slayer\ -\ South\ Of\ Heaven\ -\ 01\ -\ South\ Of\ Heaven.ogg
      [plays fine]
  % "/mnt/audio/music/S/Slayer - South Of Heaven - 01 - South Of Heaven.ogg"
  zsh: permission denied: /mnt/audio/music/S/Slayer - South Of Heaven - 01 - South Of Heaven.ogg
[snap]

Bug or intended behaviour?

Regards, Frank
