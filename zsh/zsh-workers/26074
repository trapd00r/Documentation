Thanks for looking.

The correct fix is

  zstyle ':completion:*' special-dirs true

else the completion system is correct to ignore ".." as a completion.

The previous behaviour was a bug---as you pointed out before, we were
ignoring the result of compfiles and completing files that existed even if
they didn't fulfill the match conditions we were carefully constructing.
The special-dirs behaviour is documented in zshcompsys.  The confusion
is my fault for not realising before that we needed to be more careful
with matching files.
