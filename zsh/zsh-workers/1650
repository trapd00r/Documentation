I can't make this happen on my Linux box with termcap.  (I don't have
ncurses anywhere on the system.)  I'd been playing with the cvs compctl,
too, so my history was pretty messy, with several cases where indivudual
lines or the bodies of shell functions exceeded the size of the screen.

Are you sure this problem is with Geoff's patch?

Of course, I'm in an xterm, not on the console, so maybe that makes a
difference.
