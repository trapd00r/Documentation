Apart from what Oliver already said...

If you want tabbing through the matches you can either `setopt menucomplete'
or use

  zstyle ':completion:*' menu yes

if you want arrowing, use:

  zstyle ':completion:*' menu yes select

Using `select=200' is a bit weird, giving you selection only for
rather longish lists -- and exactly that combination doesn't work in
dev-22 (if the list doesn't fit on the screen). The CVS has some new
code for that.
