Attached is a version for Git. I don't know how this file is
generated so I just modified the HTML.

I found some problems with the links on both pages though, the
daily snapshots don't work, the yodl link also doesn't work.

While we're at it, could the News page get updated to include the
latest release? For someone visiting the page it looks like Zsh
wasn't updated in two years. And maybe a direct link to the Zsh
sources could also get added, I couldn't find one when I was
checking the cvs.html links.

Thanks,
Simon

<p>
Additionally to the main CVS repository there is also a Git mirror availabl=
e,
also hosted by <a href=3D"http://sourceforge.net/">SourceForge</a>. To clone
the repository use the following command.
<p>
<tt>git clone git://zsh.git.sf.net/gitroot/zsh/zsh</tt>
<p>
You can also browse the repository online through
<a href=3D"http://zsh.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=3Dzsh/zsh">gitwe=
b</a>.
<p>
To build it, you will need to run <tt>Util/preconfig</tt> to build the
configure script. This requires that you have a copy of
<a href=3D"http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/autoconf.html">autoconf</a>
installed. Documentation is pre-built for the releases so unless you have
<a href=3D"http://www.xs4all.nl/~jantien/yodl/">Yodl</a> installed builds
=66rom Git sources will fail when they come to build documentation. This is
after zsh itself has been built so don't let that error worry you.

<p>
The master branch contains the current development.
<p>
Be aware that if you obtain your copy of Zsh in any of the ways described on
this page, it is likely to contain many more bugs than the official release=
s. If
you're not interested in having the very latest features and just want to g=
et on
with some real work get the latest stable release.
