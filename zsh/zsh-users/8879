I have something similar that I use for purposes mentioned in the original posting:

bindkey -s '\ei' '^U\e>`^Y`'

In the example it would work like this:

% locate a-file
/usr/share/prog/a-file
% cp [now I go to the history entry I want and press ESC-i]
% cp `locate a-file`

I guess it's not very elegant, since it depends on the default keybindings ^U, ESC-> and ^Y, but I hope it may be of use to someone.
