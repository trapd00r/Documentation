Unfortunately, I haven't followed this discussion closely - buy there is one
thing that actually nerves me.

It is *impossible* to split array elements. It is no joke. Arrays are joined
together before splitting - so, the result I get is much much different. As
example,

foo=(a:b x:y)
bor@itsrm2:~%> print -l ${(s/:/)foo}
a
b x
y

Where I would actually expect
a
b
x
y

Subsequent splitting on IFS does not help, as it can change "too much"

May be, nobody really needs it (I missed it time to time). And may be, there
is always workaround. But it is really really weird ...
