wow. um. yeah ok then.

.... and it still wins

nj4:~ # time openssl base64 </boot/vmlinuz >/dev/null

real    0m0.014s
user    0m0.016s
sys     0m0.000s

Yes its really there really doing it's thing:
nj4:~ # echo this is a test |openssl base64
dGhpcyBpcyBhIHRlc3QK
nj4:~ #

So it's only 5 x faster instead of 78 x :)
