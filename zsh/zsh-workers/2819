The closest you can get at the moment is something like

bindkey -s "^U" "^E^H"

(If the functions you want to use are not already bound individually,
you will have to bind them to some out-of-the-way sequence yourself.)

In the future there will be a syntax similar to

bindkey -t "^U" end-of-line backward-delete-char

.  In the nearer future, there will be a syntax similar to

function delete-last-char {
  zle end-of-line backward-delete-char
}
zle -f delete-last-char
bindkey "^U" delete-last-char

I expect to implement this much sometime in the next few weeks (when I
can find the time).
