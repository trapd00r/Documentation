That's not a zsh timeout logout.  You would have seen this if TMOUT was
the culprit:

  markko @ kunhp1>
  zsh: timeout
  Connection to kunhp1.cogsci.kun.nl closed.

You might want to try tracing the zsh process from another telnet
session (with truss/ktrace/trace/strace) and see exactly what happens
when the connection is dropped.
