} How did you work this out?

I was basing it on an observation of the awk-generated list of trap names
on my system and the lack of any explicit mention of CLD and IO elsewhere
in the trap code, vs. the presence of alt_sigs in jobs.c.

} Adding SIGERR as an alias where there's no system signal is trivial.
} Now it should show up in the trap lists under ERR, too.  I've removed
} the ALT_SIGS definition because there isn't really any justification for
} making the mechanism optional now.

I can't tell by reading the patch: does this do as Oliver suggested and
prefer the ZERR equivalent for ERR, requiring SIGERR to get the actual
signal?  If not -- that is, if SIGERR is preferred when available --
then we still don't have ksh compatibility.
