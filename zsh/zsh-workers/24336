} Is run-help really an alias, by default? At Debian it is the function
} from Functions/Misc.

Yes, it really is an alias by default.

torch% alias
run-help=man
which-command=whence
torch% 

There must be something in the /etc/z* files installed with the Debian
zsh package that removes the alias and loads the function instead.
