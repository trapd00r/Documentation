$ZSH_VERSION is 3.1.6-dev-16, and 'dpkg -l zsh' says my zsh is:
ii  zsh            3.1.6.pws16-1  A shell with lots of features.

I just tried compiling zsh-3.1.6-dev-17 both with gcc 2.95.2 in my
Debian Potato environment and with egcs-2.91.66 in my RedHat 6.1
environment (using chroot). The one compiled in Potato was broken but the
one compiled in RH 6.1 worked! 

Could someone try compiling zsh with gcc 2.95.2 and tell me if it
breaks?
