But, but, but...I don't want my code to be married with zsh, neither....

Hmmm.  Because it's my code I can do several releases of it and as
many releases with whatever licenses I happen to fancy at the
particular moment in time...be polygamous.  So I guess I could make
separate "zsh-compliant" release(s) of the code, with zsh license and
everything.  When finish the code in the first place, that is...I can
even try to build some rudimentary compatibility with the zsh globbing
code, if that helps -- and if I have the time.

See?  I said that I'm not up to speed with the zsh features...

And I still can pull another joker from my sleeve: cdpath is
definitely fiddling with the fs semantics :-)
