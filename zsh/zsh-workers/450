most excellant zsh workers,

According to the "Korn Shell Ref" card (updated for ksh93) from SSC

	[[ str == pat ]]

is preferred  and 

	[[ str = pat ]] 

is "obsolete" (but still works of course).

Can the == for [[ be added to zsh?  We've got some code that
needs to work on both ksh and zsh so it would be nice...

thx,
glenn
