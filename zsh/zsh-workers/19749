Yes, it would still have to have some patching, but it would be minor now
that my more significant code changes have been accepted into source.

Hmmm...  I have thought about doing this, but time and resources are an
issue right now.  In a few more weeks, I hope to have had some hardware
reconfiguration done and be in a better position to actually do this in
an automated fashion.  But, for the moment, I can't really accommodate
you.  Sorry.

Reguarding scripts... mkzsh was just something I literally threw together
on a sunday afternoon, along with a few Cygwin command completion
scripts.  They are only intended for Cygwin and unuseful for other
platforms, so I have not deemed them worth enough to submit to source and
maintain them separately, like I maintain the Cygwin build script.  I see
you've contributed (much improved) versions of some of those completion
scripts, and I encourage you to continue in that vein.  If you feel they
should be contributed... well... convince me why they should. :)
