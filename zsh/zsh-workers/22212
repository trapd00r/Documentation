    But you probably are right, because the for loop is one of the
points where the list can be splitted.

    You're having another problem, David, because when invoked as
/bin/sh, SH_WORD_SPLIT must be enabled (well, set), as you can read
in the Zsh manual (sections 3.2 and 15.2.10). If yours have that
option disabled, then there is a problem in your RCs :((

    OK, I'll take a look. Have you prepared any kind of test case
with only libtool? Some simple command to reproduce the problem, if
any, so I can avoid compiling a whole package to isolate the bug.
