The very first time PATH is obviously empty and expands to nothing, so you
get
    PATH=$i:

empty PATH component is the same as . (current dir).

Use array `path' instead of scalar PATH:

   path=($i $path)

Or explicitly test if PATH is not empty

  if [[ -n "$PATH" ]]; then
    PATH=$i:$PATH
  else
    PATH=$i
  fi
