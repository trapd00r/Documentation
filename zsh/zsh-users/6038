Subject: How to stop triggering automount on completion?
Date: Mon, 21 Apr 2003 15:45:08 +0400
MIME-Version: 1.0

Content-Type: text/plain

Completing /mnt/cdrom/... on mandrake with supermount enabled tries to
access second CD - and it is really slow.

I remember it was possible to prevent NFS automounter from jumping in on
completion - anybody remembers how to do it? Was it specific for automounter
only?

Alternatively even "always accept exact match in /mnt" would be enough but I
am not sure it is easier :)
