Dear List, =0A=0AIn my last mail the word "search widget" must have been a =
bit confusing. I =0Aactually meant "history-search widget". Fish (and Fizsh=
) allow a Matlab-like =0Ahistory search, which looks for SUBstrings of what=
 you currently have on the =0Acommand line. =0A=0A=0ABest wishes, =0A=0AGui=

i Julien, Peter and other ZSH users, =0A> =0A> Today I uploaded a "package"=
 that  provides a "Fish-like" user interface to =0A>ZSH. =0A>=0A> Of course=
 I used Julien's  excellent syntax highlighting code from =0A> https://gith=
ub.com/nicoulaj/zsh-syntax-highlighting for the syntax  =0A>highlighting =
=0A>=0A> stuff. The package also contains a search widget, which I  partial=
ly cooked up =0A=0A> myself. It is based on an idea proposed by Peter in 20=
09 =0A> (http://www.zsh.org/mla/users/2009/msg00818.html). For the rest I a=
dded some =0A> scripts that take care of installing the files to the right =
location. =0A> =0A> =0A> The project is called Fizsh, meaning Friendly Inte=
ractive ZSHell. It  is a =0A> frontend to ZSH. Its purpose is to quickly pr=
ovide users with an easy  looking =0A=0A> (Fish-like) environment, in which=
 they can still execute  Bourn-syntax =0A>snippets. =0A>=0A> This will hope=
fully entice users relatively new to  ZSH, but it may also be of =0A=0A> in=
terest to existing users, who like the Fish  user interface and who want to=
 =0A>use =0A>=0A> it while being able to use Bourn-syntax  snippets at the =
same time. =0A> =0A> =0A> I don't intend to fork Julien's syntax  highlight=
ing code. For future versions =0A>I =0A>=0A> will just check-out the latest=
  version of his script. The search-widget will =0A> have to be improved on=
 the  sourceforge site. There are some obvious bugs in =0A>it, =0A>=0A> alt=
hough I find it  quite workable. Anyone who has ideas, bug-reports, or =0A>=
 patches, please feel  free to mail them to me, or to the FiZsh mailing lis=
t at =0A=0A> sourceforge. =0A> =0A> =0A> For those interested: the project =
is available at =0A> http://sourceforge.net/projects/fizsh/. You can find a=
 tarball there, and a =0A> ".deb" archive. =0A> =0A> =0A> Best wishes, =0A>=
