} The same happens if I hit TAB after "man -a 2 ".
} Is that a bug or a feature?

It's neither, really.  The _man completer simply doesn't support any of
the GNU "man" command-line switches.  The only option it understands is
the crufty old "man -l" for manpage-formatting a named file rather than
by searching the manpath (which it appears GNU man doesn't even permit
any longer).
