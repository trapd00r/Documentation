Is the forward-word behaviour intentionally different from GNU Emacs?

If I type Ctrl-a, Meta-f the cursor ends up 
with zsh:
            aaaa    bbbb    cccc
                    ^
with emacs:
            aaaa    bbbb    cccc
                ^

(zsh 3.0.2, emacs 19.34)

I'd like to change this, and tried 'bindkey | grep forw' but found
nothing interesting.
