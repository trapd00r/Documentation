Subject: trap DEBUG + set -o DEBUG_BEFORE_CMD not setting $? nonzero in current CVS

The following code doesn't show $? as nonzero inside trap DEBUG using the
CVS source I just downloaded and built.

However I don't get this problem on the Ubuntu zsh-beta or zsh.
Removing DEBUG_BEFORE_CMD (or I guess having debug run after the
command) does set/show $? properly.

#!/tmp/zsh/Src/zsh -f
#!/src/external-cvs/zsh/Src/zsh -f
set -o DEBUG_BEFORE_CMD
trap 'print $?' DEBUG
fdasfsdafd  # invalid command
:

Thanks.
