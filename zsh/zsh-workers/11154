More information would have been helpful here (my nslookup does not do 
such things):

- Does it use other environment variables? If so, which. In which
  order? I.e. which one overrides all others?
- If $PAGER is not set, does it use a default pager or does it just
  dump the help to the output? I.e. is it enough to locally unset
  PAGER in nslookup() or should we locally export PAGER=cat?

Could you please try?

Bye
 Sven
