} I agree the defaults need changing at some point --- and it might as well

Actually, you're still a little confused, I think.  There appear to be
some stray "x"s here:

} -    [if test "x$enable_lfs" != x -a "x$enable_lfs" != xyes \
} -     -a "x$enable_lfs" != xno; then
} -      zsh_64_BIT_TYPE(${enable_lfs}, zsh_cv_64_bit_type, force)
} +    [if test $lfs != xyes -a $lfs != xno; then
} +      zsh_64_BIT_TYPE(${lfs}, zsh_cv_64_bit_type, force)

It should either be

    [if test x$lfs != xyes -a x$lfs != xno; then
      zsh_64_BIT_TYPE(${lfs}, zsh_cv_64_bit_type, force)

or

    [if test $lfs != yes -a $lfs != no; then
      zsh_64_BIT_TYPE(${lfs}, zsh_cv_64_bit_type, force)

and I suppose it's preferably the latter.
