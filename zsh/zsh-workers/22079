Noting that I haven't actually tried 4.3 yet, what happens to people who
use bindkey -m to get all the M- bindings?  I use them all the time, and
can't imagine not being able to use them.  Do you have to find new bindings
for those widgets, or does M-whatever still work, but there's a new way of
binding those keystrokes?
