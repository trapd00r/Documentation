I usually overcome this problem by using $HOME in my scripts.  I
think this is a better way because you can put it in the middle of
double-quote quoted strings (but not single quotes.)

export MAILPATH="$HOME/mailspool/rusty:$HOME/Mail/z?Zsh mail."

IMHO its a good habit to get into.

better understand parameter expansion??

echo $HOME "$HOME" '$HOME' ~ "~" '~'

/home/wheel/dunc /home/wheel/dunc $HOME /home/wheel/dunc ~ ~


PS: what was the rationale behind quoting tildes?  Not critising
    it, but this means it isn't a short parameter ... so what is
    it?


cheers,

dunc
