You're right; the reason for -r was originally I was just going to make
it reset, but I decided there was no point unless it reinitialized, so
-f would make more sense.

Yes, and I think there are plenty of places where utilities stick their
own mailcap files which might or might not be useful.  A style for
the sets for mailcap and mime.types files (maybe the style should be
mime-types for consistency) and possibly browsers would be useful as
well as very easy.  I'll make the styles begin with :mime: unless anyone
has a better idea.

Yuk.  I'll try this at home.

Most of my recent functions seem to use two spaces, too.

I will probably commit the files after another set of changes without
posting them again when I get a chance to fiddle.
