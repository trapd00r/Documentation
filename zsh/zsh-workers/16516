Good analysis. An dnow I'm back at thinking: do we really want that?

It would mean that in cases like `_argument -longoption :foo:' that
long option names (or, more likely, those long option names) couldn't
be completed. Very ugly, if you ask me.

If we don't want to be able to complete the options, we would just
have to add `$PREFIX' or some such as a possible match.

Sometimes I think that in such cases we should only force the message
to be displayed, even if a match was accepted. And this is also
affected by the fake style thing we are discussing (which might turn a
case of `displaying a message' into `adding some matches').


Bye
