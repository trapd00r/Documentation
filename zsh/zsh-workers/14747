} Can we turn this on, or is there some good reason for not having it?

autoconf.texi from the autoconf 2.50 cvs repository says:

-------------
By default, @code{configure} uses no cache file (technically, it uses
@option{--cache-file=/dev/null}), to avoid problems caused by accidental
use of stale cache files.

To enable caching, @code{configure} accepts @option{--config-cache} (or
@option{-C}) to cache results in the file @file{config.cache}.

 ....

@c FIXME: Do we really want to document this guy?
@defmac AC_CACHE_LOAD
@maindex CACHE_LOAD
Loads values from existing cache file, or creates a new cache file if a
cache file is not found.  Called automatically from @code{AC_INIT}.
@end defmac
-------------

So we could explicitly call AC_CACHE_LOAD, but it could go away in the
future.
