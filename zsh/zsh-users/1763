} Could I define sudo somehow, to say that its first argument ought to
} be expanded as if it were in the command position?

Yes:

alias sudo='sudo '

The trailing space in the sudo alias tells zsh to also apply alias
expansion again to the next word that follows it.

} I already think I ought to be able to change how spell-correction
} works, to say that some words just don't correspond to files (like the
} first argument to tar), and possibly to say that some words ought to
} correspond to non-existent files.

Programmable spelling correction would be the next logical step after
programmable completion, I suppose.
