That works too.  I went with the setopt .. unsetopt since that's what
other completion functions were doing.  I do prefer the anonymous
function, aside from my objection to calling such things functions.
If I could pass arguments after the '}' maybe but you still cannot
control when it is called - it's only a local scope, not a function.
