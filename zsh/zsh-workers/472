I meant to reply to this earlier but got sidetracked.  Having zsh execute
a shell function at this point is easy.  The hard part is passing all the
information that you can access in WATCHFMT to this shell function.  We
would probably have to create more special parameters to do this.  I'm
not sure if it is worth it.
