Intentionally.  I wanted it to be able to work in a installation-like
setup, thinking that those who work with the source-form of the
completion system know how to set up their $fpath properly.

Do you want to say that we should change the tests to also look for,
say, $_compdir/Base/Core and if that exists, add `$_compdir/*/*(/)'?

I thought that this once was intended to cope with the case that
$_compdir is set to the directory that (before the move) contained the
comp* functions.  There the thing above made sense.  But since nowadays
the comp* functions are in the top-level directory itself it didn't seem
to make sense to look for certain sub-directories of the parent
directory of $_compdir.  Was I mistaken?
