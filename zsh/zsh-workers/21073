I think it's to do with the way they're closed.  There's no way of
knowing whether they're attached to the command currently passing
through execcmd() or to some shell structure that's calling a command at
a lower level, so there's the risk of a file descriptor being closed too
early.

A more rational way to do this might be to have a list of file
descriptors to close in the job structure, like the existing "filelist"
of temporary files to be deleted.

I'll commit my patch.
