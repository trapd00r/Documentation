Ah, I see, so this should be fairly obvious once I track back and see
what the code referred to is... I'll try and get round to this this
evening.

There is already an EVALLINENO option to control the line number

without some clear evidence of need.  Use of (the
not-yet-properly-named) ZSH_FILE_LINE looks likely to be more useful.
