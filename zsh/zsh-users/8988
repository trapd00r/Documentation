I think the closest you can get without a modification of the source code
is this:

precmd () {
  local x=$?	# This must be the first line of precmd!
  # ... do whatever precmd stuff you already do, then ...
  # This requires zmodload zsh/parameter plus extendedglob:
  (( x == 20 )) && jobs %${(k)^jobstates[(R)^*:+:*]}
}

Not a lot, is it?

Oh, well; you can't always get what you want.
