I'm not all that familiar with how Cygwin simulates UNIX pipelines.  We
are talking about command output piped to the "read" builtin -- is that
the same as console input?

In any case, stripping CRs from the i/o stream would only mask the
problem.  It'd be at least as helpful to know why adding a CR to the
IFS value causes a segmentation fault.
