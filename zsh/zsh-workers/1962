No, quoted-printable is not necessary.  The original mail used plain 8bit
encoding.  The mail server runs sendmail-8.7.3 which asks the destination
machine wether it accepts 8bit mails and if it doesn't sendmail converts
the 8bit message to quoted printable.  But even quoted-printable should be
handled by all MIME aware mail readers.  So it seems that both the MTA and
your mail reader needs some upgrade on your system.
