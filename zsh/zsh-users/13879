It just looks nicer in the terminal window - not just in history but 
also when someone looks over your shoulder or you demonstrate stuff. 
Global aliases are hugely useful and I always use them when I switch to 
bash or Take Command - and then realize that they - of course - don't 
work there.

Compare this:

    h -dE 0 G hex L

    h -dE 0 | grep hex | less

The former is easier to type but the latter is easier to read.
