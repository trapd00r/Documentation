:I'm currently playing with Zsh under Cygwin (the latest Net release). So
:far, it looks promising; of course, modules fail.

I built one about ten days ago without modules (-dev-22).  The only thing
I had to change to get it to work smoothly was turn off the (detected) MMAP
settings in config.h though I'd be interested to hear if anyone's got a
working version with MMAP.
