     pound-insert (unbound) (#) (unbound)
          If there is no # character  at  the  beginning  of  the
          buffer,  add  one  to  the  beginning of each line.  If
          there is one, remove a # from each line that  has  one.
          In   either   case,   accept  the  current  line.   The
          INTERACTIVE_COMMENTS option must be  set  for  this  to
           have any usefulness.

So, just M-x pound-insert ENTER. Even on other shells, it is useful to 
ctrl-a, insert some character or perhaps ": " and press enter.
