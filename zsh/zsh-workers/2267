What is the reason of this?  I cannot find anything so bad in the GPL
-- it actually seems to be quite similar to the current zsh license.

There was quite a lot of talk on XEmacs mailing list about Stallman
and his (alleged) paranoia, but it was mostly connected with assigning
the copyright to the FSF.  What is wrong with the GPL itself?
