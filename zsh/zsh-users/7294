    Of course, I didn't think of it, but a song name may have any
character :( Well, that's simple using ${/\/|/} on the appropriate
parameter, or something like that.

    Manipulating the names later is not a problem, since Zsh behaves
quite well quoting when completing, etc... The only problem could be
names starting with '-', but almost all Linux utilities admit '--' as
end-of-options separator. 

    Again, thanks for your useful advice :)
