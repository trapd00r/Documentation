Before someone corrects me... of course there is a bit of interaction
with menu completion or selection. Without that you won't be able to
select that all-matches-match.

For people who don't really like menu completion but sometimes envy
people that use it, there is the automenu option (and the menu
style). Using menu selection instead of ol' menu completion should
make navigation easier.
