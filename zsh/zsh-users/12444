} Uhm, I can't follow you (yet).  If $@ contains the additional args, why
} isn't zsh -$- "$@" enough then?

Try this:

    bash -c 'print zsh -$- "$@"' more args here

Note that neither the "-c ..." nor the word "more" are printed.  Both
of those are needed to correctly excute a new shell for the command that
scp originally passed to bash, but you can't get at them.
