It looks like RedHat 7 chose to release a pre-release development compiler
with their system.  There are other problems with this compiler (such as
incompatible name-mangling in some languages, such as C++), and the GCC
folks have publicly complained about this situation.  I'd recommend that
you file a bug report with the gcc folks about it, though, so that this
bug doesn't affect their forthcoming 3.0 release.  What to do about the
current RedHat 7.0 users is another kettle of fish, though.
