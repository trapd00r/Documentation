That means something, somewhere in shell code is referring to your home
directory as ~garga (which would expand to /home/garga).  After that's
happened once it's treated as a candidate for abbreviation wherever name
directories are valid.  You have various choices:

- If you want to track down what it is, you'll probably need to get
the completion system to output debug information with "^X?".  This
could be time-consuming to get completely to the bottom of.

- If you always want directories to be shown in full, you can replace
%~ in your path with %/.  That will show /home/garga instead of ~ when
you're not root, however.

- If you want the prompt to be abbreviated only when you're not root,
you can change it to

PROMPT='%n@%B%m%b:%(#.%/#.%~>) '

- If you're happy with your home directory always being abbreviated when
you're root, so that at least it doesn't change, you can put a reference
to it in the initialisation file:

: ~garga
