I've recently started using Emacs RCS for some scripts.

The problem is that I'm getting the comma-v and the backup files when I go  
to do tab completion:

# mkt[tab]
mktargz      mktargz,v    mktargz.~1~

Is there a way to make completion ignore files that end with ,v and .~1~ ??   
If so, how and if not, when ;-?

Thanks

TjL
