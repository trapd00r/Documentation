Problem solved.

/bin/ed was not handling things correctly.

Got myself the nifty GNU-ed and things seem to be compiling just fine

Thanks for zefram for helping me figure that one out!

And now, a question:

Q: when running ./configure I saw this:

	checking for termcap.h... no

but it is there !

/usr/local/include/termcap.h

is a link to

/usr/local/include/ncurses.4.1/termcap.h

Why didn't it see it?  Isn't /usr/local/include/ a relatively normal place  
to look?  Or maybe because it was a link ?
