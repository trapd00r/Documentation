I confess not.  By the way, has zsh been ported to the Macintosh? or to
any non-Unix OS?

Okay -- (not knowing how lex.c works puts me somewhat at a disadvantage) --
in light of what you say, then what I mean is that the whitespace would have
to be escaped with backslash or quotes to be non-trivial.  E.g., the glob
pattern
	( file*.* ~ file.c )
would be equivalent to
	(file*.*~file.c)
and
	(  )
would be the empty pattern, whereas
	(my\ file)
or
	'my file'
would each match the 7-character filename 'my file'.
