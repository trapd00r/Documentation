A while ago I asked about generalization of the nested command in find
-exec.  What if I have to execute a random series of shell commands
for each file found by find and given to exec -- how should I package
the series under zsh?  I tried -exec (cmd1; cmd2; cmd3) and it seems
not to work -- find complains about ( and ) and loses ; ...  Is it a
shell-sensitive problem or find-specific?

Cheers,
Alexy
