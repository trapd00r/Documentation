As sunsite.dk is now prefered over sunsite.auc.dk (I've confirmed this 
with Karsten to be sure), I've changed all references in the docs and 
READMEs to point to just sunsite.dk. I've left references in NEWS and 
Changelogs alone as they are sort-of historical and I've also left 
Etc/FAQ.yo alone - I'm guessing that Peter has the definitive copy of 
this elsewhere anyway. I'll also change any references on the web pages 
later.
