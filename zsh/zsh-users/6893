} So, print -l * gives the right order, but still menu-completion offers =

There appears to be a bug masquerading as an optimization in the file-sor=
t
style.

When either no ordering (style not set), or name ordering, is requested,
_path_files puts the names into a sorted group so that the completion
system reorders them internally, thereby bypassing the LC_COLLATE order.

If on the other hand you request any non-name ordering, or reverse name
ordering, then _path_files orders the names with globbing and puts them
into an unsorted group so that completion skips the internal reordering.
