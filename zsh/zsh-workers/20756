Branched from zsh-4_2_3.  I've committed ONLY the following to that branch:

* 20728 (with typo fixed): RLIMIT_MSGQUEUE, RLIMIT_SIGPENDING
* users/8422: [[ ... -nt ... ]] and [[ ... -ot ... ]]
* users/8433: Latest Cygwin hangs on FIFO test

There may be additional Cygwin fixes that should be added to this branch
before a 4.2.4 is produced.
