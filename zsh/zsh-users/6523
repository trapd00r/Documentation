See the README file for 4.0.7.


A change between 4.0.6 and 4.0.7 affects substitutions of the form
${foo/src/rep} and ${foo//src/rep}.  In 4.0.6, a literal `/' was quoted in
the `src' text with two backslashes.  This was documented, but inconsistent
with normal quoting conventions and poorly implemented.  The `/' now
requires only one backslash to quote it whether or not the expresion occurs
in double quotes.  For example:
  % foo=word/bird
  % print ${foo/\//-} "${foo/\//+}"
  word-bird word+bird
Note also the following workaround which is valid in all versions of the
shell that support this syntax:
  % slash=/
  % foo=word/bird
  % print ${foo/$slash/-} "${foo/$slash/+}"
