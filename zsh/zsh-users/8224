Hello,

Some related questions:

1. Is there any reason why _mutt shouldn't also complete

% mutt -f[TAB]

with '=' (appart from \! \> \<?), e.g.:

% mutt -f=

 and then complete on mutt's mailboxes?

I know that normally 

=foo expands to `which foo`, but the here we would have -f= right
before. Does EQUALS still play a role here?

2. All my email is in a non-standard directory /home/foo/foomail and
some folders are maildirs and some mailboxes, how should I use zstyle to
tell, say, _mailboxes to complete to these?

I know there is a mailboxes tag, but I haven't really understood the
zen of zstyle yet...

Peace.
Francisco (Who wants to start mucking with _mutt, but it's checking some
things first).
