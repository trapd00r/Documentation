That was a bit of a red herring; I have the exact same problem with a
normal make & make check.  I wonder if this has something to do with it:

%   mkdir redir.tmp && cd redir.tmp
% 
%   myfd=99
%   (echo >&$myfd) 2>msg
%   bad_fd_msg="${$(<msg)##*:}"
%   print foo >&-
% cat msg
zsh: 99: bad file descriptor
% <Ctrl-D to exit shell>
foo
