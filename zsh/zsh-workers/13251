Hrm.  Well, it's correct in so far as it goes; the :r and :e modifiers
appear to assume that they're already working on the result of :t, and
pay no attention at all to slash characters; they just find the rightmost
'.' and split on it.  They've worked this way for as long as zsh has
existed, AFAICT.

Tcsh behaves the same, so I don't expect we'll be changing it any time
soon.
