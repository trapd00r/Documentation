Subject: tab during menu completion

I'm using zsh 4.1.1, and I like the menu based completion:

zstyle ':completion:*' menu yes=2 select=2 interactive

But I have a problem when I type the following:

ls /etc/<TAB>

[Menu appears here]

I hit <TAB> again.

My command line is then replaced to:

/etc/^@^@^@

Is it possible to bind <TAB> to forward-char during the menu selection?

Thanks,

Daniel
