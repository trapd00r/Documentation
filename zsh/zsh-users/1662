Phew!

I finally managed to bind shift-tab to reverse-menu-complete in Linux
console mode, through tweaking a bit with my keymap and binding meta-tab
to shift-tab. However, when trying to quote alt-tab using control-v
alt-tab, an escape character is quoted (^[), and a beep is sent to the
speaker, instead of generating the entire sequence ^[^I. How is that?

Similarly, I can't quote the tab character this way. Control-v tab or
control-v control-i generates an unquoted tab

I, for one, would find quoting the given keystroke more intuitive. If
this isn't a bug, please explain the logic in this behaviour (it just
might be some kind of a great feature...).
