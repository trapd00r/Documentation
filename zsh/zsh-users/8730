Oops, I had missed the "once" in "stop once".

I expected "stop once" to be the default and setting 'stop' to true to
give me a full stop, ie no wrapping at all, same way as when reaching
the end of history-incremental-search-(for|back)ward.

I guess the problem is that I think about this as a history-search-word
like function and not as menu completion.
