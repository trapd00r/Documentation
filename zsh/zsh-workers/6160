Because globsubst and ${~...} only do filename *generation* not filename
*expansion*.  It's always been like this ... you never noticed?

Tilde is not a glob character.

I always thought that using tilde as the turn-on-globsubst character was
a bad idea because it tends to make one think that tilde-expansion will
happen ... but there's really no other character available.
