hello,

i'm thinking that it'd be really handy to have some sort of
shell construct that looks like

    tar zxvf {{*.tar.gz}}

which basically expands to

    for i in *.tar.gz; do tar zxvf $i; done

(ignore the silly syntax i'm using, of course).  is this
possible at all?  i think it's used frequently enough that it
might be worthwhile to implement.
