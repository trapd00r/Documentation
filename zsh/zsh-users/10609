Are you sure?  It's parsed left to right and it's supposed to look for
the delimiters for the "e" before even thinking about the next
qualifier---given that pretty much anything can occur in the middle
that's about the only way it could work.  I can do this:

% echo g*
glob.c glob.epro glob.o glob.pro glob.syms

% echo g*(e:'reply=(${REPLY[2,-1]}${REPLY[1]}ay)':)
lob.cgay lob.eprogay lob.ogay lob.progay lob.symsgay
% echo g*(e+'reply=(${REPLY[2,-1]}${REPLY[1]}ay)'+)
lob.cgay lob.eprogay lob.ogay lob.progay lob.symsgay

% trangefysay() { reply=(${REPLY[2,-1]}${REPLY[1]}ay) }
% echo g*(e+'trangefysay'+)
lob.cgay lob.eprogay lob.ogay lob.progay lob.symsgay
% echo g*(+trangefysay)
lob.cgay lob.eprogay lob.ogay lob.progay lob.symsgay
