Cleanliness.  Obviousness of purpose.

The scripts I write are liable to be modified by others.  So the purpose
of stuff should be clear.  Nice clean explicit statements of what a
variable is help.  So integers get declared as such, etc.  And if that
adds type-checking, all the better.

I just prefer zsh to perl ...
