Ok. Wacky idea here. I'm interested in mudding, but don't like the mud
clients that are available. I think a shell script would work, if I
could get zsh to do the following:
1. read output from the server and print it, while reading input from me
and sending it out. That's the most important.
2. be able to use readline while reading input. Has a zsh module been
developped for readline? Can this be done?
Thanks,
Tyler
