    OK, but that doesn't solve the problem I explained below. And I
assumed that I must use $PREFIX :? I don't understand why I must
remove the last path element from PREFIX :?

    Done, but then I'm presented the same list again and again:

    $ cd Projects/<TAB>

    Projects Work ...

    I see, I need more tweaking. I'll keep on reading...

    First error I made, then. I did something like this:

    compset -P '*/'
    compadd -f - $IPREFIX$PREFIX*(/)

> That will now try to add stuff like `Projects/more' as a match when

    I tried to do something like that but it didn't work. I don't
know what my mistake was, I'm afraid...

    That works perfectly, thanks a lot :) The only part I didn't
understand was the -W flag. I mean, the manual says this flag adds the
string to the WORDS, and I though that the process was:

    - compadd expands the pattern and build a list of words
    - compadd matches the words with the current word being completed
    - compadd produces a list of matches
    - the contents of -W is added to THAT list

    But if I understand correctly, the string that follows '-W' is
added *before* compadd does the matching, am I wrong?

> Hope that helps

    It *really* helps, thanks a lot, Oliver :)

    Only one more thing, abusing of you O:). I get a segfault under
4.0.9 (probably it is fixed in newer versions) if I do this:

    zle -C expand-or-complete expand-or-complete _completer

    function _completer () {

        emulate -L zsh

        setopt extendedglob globdots globassign null_glob

        compstate[insert]=${compstate[insert]//tab /}

        compadd -p 'A' -f - $PREFIX*(/)

        return 0
    }

    and I do something like 'cd A <TAB>'. Do you know why?
