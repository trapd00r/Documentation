	Ah.  I meant glob completion as in "compctl using
globs", rather than "completion using glob_complete", especially since
glob_complete doesn't actually use globbing (according to the man page).

	That wouldn't help me figure out what was broken,
however.  I'm stubborn enough to want to waste my time trying to
figure out what changed, rather than just changing other things until
it works.  Upgrading to 4.x is on my todo list, however.

	3.1.9; I've been using it for at least a year, and at some
point the completion worked.  I made some changes many months ago,
but hadn't used any of the commands whose compctls used -g in at least
the last six months.

> what happens

	They work fine under zsh -f; sorry for not mentioning that
in my original post.
