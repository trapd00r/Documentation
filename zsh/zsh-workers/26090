Did you try it in 4.3.9?  I tried it on three different versions, before
and after 4.3.6, and got the same result.  If your system is doing
something different I'd like to find out what.

I *can* get the test to pass if I undefine PATH_DEV_FD and define
HAVE_FIFOS, so it looks like this is the way forward.  Some
investigation of why HAVE_FIFOS doesn't get define automatically would
be useful.

(I tried adding a "sync" pipe to getpipe() in the same way as in the
other pipe code, but it didn't seem to help.)

I'm also finding that I can read files with mode 000, so the [[ -r
... ]] test fails (but it's clearly doing the right thing, since "cat"
on the file works, too).  This may be because I have administrator
rights.  Unless some Cygwin expert can do this better, I'll apply the
following.

This is with Cygwin updated from the stable versions yesterday.
