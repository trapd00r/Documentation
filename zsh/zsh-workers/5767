The code explicitly tests:

	} else if ((*s == '#' || *s == Pound) &&
		   (iident(s[1])
		    || s[1] == '*' || s[1] == Star || s[1] == '@'
		    || (isstring(s[1]) && (s[2] == Inbrace || s[2] == Inpar))))

Also, I find the difference between ${#${:-...}} and "${#${:-...}}"
slightly irritating (again) -- the first one always yields `1' because 
the inner ${...} is taken as an array with one element.

Bye
 Sven
