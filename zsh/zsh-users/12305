You're right, this isn't documented anywhere sensible.

It's set automatically by the shell if it determines that the shell will
use standard input.  However...

Do you mean the description of SHIN_STDIN?  It does indeed imply
(although not *quite* explicitly state, since the logic is a little
tortuous) this will be off if -c is given, whereas it isn't.

It's not entirely clear to me if this is intentional or not.  The code
for -c explicitly sets the option to 0, but then the code later
explicitly sets it to 1 if there is no argument list.  The former code
appears to be redundant since at that point the option would be zero, so
this is fishy.(*)  So I've gone with the documentation, since the
basic rationale (the commands being executed aren't being read from
stdin) is clear.

There's a side effect, reflected in the test patch: commands after -c
now get line numbers in error messages as scripts do.  I consider this a
feature.

(*) Actually, it's possible that the user had explicitly requested
shinstdin before -c.  But it didn't reset shinstdin if that was
explicitly requested after -c.  Further, the other case of picking up
commands, a script argument, doesn't reset shinstdin.  So I still don't
like it.

 If the tt(-m) flag is given the arguments are taken as patterns
