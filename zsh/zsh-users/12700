:-)  Actually, I wasn't sure it was a bug:  zsh's _arguments
function alone is more complicated than many other stand-alone
applications, so I assumed it was just a feature that could be
fixed using some obscure feature.  When deciding where to post, I
placed my trust in the completion system's endless configurability
and you guys' seemingly supernatural ability to keep track of
it all.  I guess that makes me an optimist, but it has worked
for me before. :-)

Seems to work perfectly; thank you for putting in so much work to
fix this!
