If I'm not completely mistaken, there was a reply, but maybe that
wasn't CC'ed to you?

I hope many people have seen this (sorry, couldn't resist ;-).

It's intentional and controlled by the AUTO_REMOVE_SLASH option. If it 
is set, several of the automatically added suffixes (such as the `/'
after directory names) are removed when the next character type
seperates the completed string from the next word (i.e. if you type a
character such as space, `;', etc.).
