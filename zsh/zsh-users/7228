Hi Raúl ;),

Indeed i use it that way, shift+pag keys for scrollback and control+pag
keys for zsh history functions. This mail is making a new question
arose in my head... ;). It's not related to Zsh, so sorry for the noise ;).
How can the size of the scrollback buffer be incremented? I guess it is
in the kernel console driver, but where? I looked for it some time ago
and didn't find it...

thanks
