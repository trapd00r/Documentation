*grumble*.  What's anyone ever going to use noexec for other than syntax
checking?  I'd prefer that we give the option a consistent behaviour.
For the record, pdksh makes no such distinction between commands in a
function and commands at the top level:

$ foo () { echo foo $-; set -n; echo bar $-; }
$ echo foo $-
foo ims
$ foo
foo ims
bar imns
$ echo bar $-
bar imns
