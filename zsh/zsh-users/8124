I suggest that further procmail discussion be re-routed to the procmail
list <procmail@lists.RWTH-Aachen.DE>.

I think you may want ^TO rather than ^TO_ there.  ^TO_ is for matching an
address, not a word.  Also, the zsh lists have not set a Sender: header
for a very long time; rather, they have

Delivered-To: mailing list zsh-user@sunsite.dk

(or zsh-workers, as appropriate).

Probably, sending you a personal copy, like I did with this message.

This is broken, or at least useless.  The magic tokens are ^TO_ or ^TO 
(all the characters have to be consecutive).  You can't use TO_ or TO just 
anywhere.

You don't HAVE to do it that way.  This works, too:

  :0
  * (^TO_|^Sender:[  ]+owner-)zsh\
   |^From:.*(schaefer@brasslantern\.com\
            |duvall@comfychair\.org\
            |pws@csr\.com\
            )\
   |^(Delivered\-To|Mailing\-List|Received):.*zsh\-\
   |^Newsgroups:.*comp\.shells\.zsh\
   |^Posted\-To:.*zsh

Just don't forget the backslashes at the ends of lines (and they must not 
have any spaces following them, before the newline).

No, they start with a score of zero.  Only rules that accumulate a score
greater than zero trigger an action.
