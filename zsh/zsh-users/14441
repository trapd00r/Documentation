Well, the server completion right after // isn=E2=80=99t that much of a wor=
ry.
 What I can=E2=80=99t get working is completion of the share or any folders
below it.  Might it be a zstyle I have(n=E2=80=99t) set?  I really don=E2=
=80=99t
fiddle that much with zstyles for completion.

Thanks, Peter, for a quick and precise answer; as usual.  I don=E2=80=99t w=
ant
to begin ranting, but I have got to say that this mailing list is
fantastic.  Great people, great discussions, and great questions and
answers.  Thank you, everyone!
