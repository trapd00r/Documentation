I'm sure it must be `--help' with braces just for clarity.  I don't
have GNU test installed here, but all the GNU programs I have which
accept --help, accept it just as written (and these all work fine with
zsh---zsh doesn't normally do anything special with --help, although
it's probably possible to change this), and this behaviour is in the
guidelines for GNU programs.  It would be very surprising if test was
an exception.
