I cvs update'd and now i'm not getting any more crashes. However, when
i make these things directories instead of files, cd <tab><tab>
doesn't add any trailing slashes. If i mkdir =D8a =D8b aa ab, then cd
<tab><tab><tab> and so on adds trailing slashes after aa and ab, but
not the first two. (with the same zsh -f sequence as earlier)
