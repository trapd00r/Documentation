Unfortunately 

  fn() { local sep; print $+sep; }
  fn

prints 1.  I can't see any good reason to ignore a separator that's been
supplied.  I'm going to commit the following and see what breaks.
Playing with dd and parameter subscript completions suggests not a great
deal, at least.

I'm sure the quoting of the argument to _values is wrong in _regex_words
is wrong in some way, and it's certainly inconsistent with the other
branch.
