I was thinking about this and got as far as writing an xtermclone script.
The big problem seems to be xterm needs to fork its own process while
the zsh process needs to be forked from the old one.  This means you need
another sentinel process for the xterm which is a bit ugly.  Also, with
zsh as it stands it's hard to get that sentinel process to pause cleanly;
if that's going to be a common problem it would be worth adding a (trivial)
pause builtin to the module.
