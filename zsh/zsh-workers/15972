} Is anyone keeping track of 4.0 patches or should I go through the log

Unfortunately, no, this time I've only been keeping track of the patches
that I put on the branch myself.  Nobody seems to have agreed with (or
at least, not stuck with) my suggestion that ChangeLog entries on the
branch be kept in sync with the original appearance of the patch on the
trunk, which would have made diffing the changes simpler.  I was planning
to just diff the entire trees to attempt to determine what else might
need to be copied, but I've been pretty busy.  (I shouldn't even be out
of bed now ...)
