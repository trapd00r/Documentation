Hello friends,

You all may have already seen this, but (at least in Ubuntu) there is
a package called zsh-lovers that is a manpage of zsh examples.  It's
more convenient for looking up that one syntax that you tend to forget
than trying to search zshall or figuring out which zsh manfile it's
actually in.

Anyway, hope this helps someone.

(Note, man zsh-lovers will bring up the manfile.)
