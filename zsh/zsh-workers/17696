I've already checked that, and if i didn't miss something, this part of the
Makefile is generated from the script mklibgcc, which calls xgcc with the 
contents of a $flags variable. This variable is the result of applying a sed
expression to the values contained in MULTILIB. Beyond MULTILIB i wasn't 
able to continue tracking down the problem :(, gcc makefiles/configure system
are a 'bit' cryptic for me. By the way, i also tried configuring gcc with
the --disable-multilib option, but the error still appeared.
