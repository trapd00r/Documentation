You can do this by setting the `stop' style, which is so called because it
stops when it has reached as far back into the history as it can (unlike
normal menu completion which would continue cycling).

  zstyle ':completion:history-words:*' stop 1

You should also be able to turn on menu completion just in this context,
but I couldn't get that to work with a brief try, for some reason.

What doesn't work which probably ought to is that if you type `\e,'
(_history-complete-newer) it should cycle back in the other direction.
Probably nobody thought about it at the time.
