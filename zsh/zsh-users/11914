Subject: ulimit differences between zsh and bash on Linux
To: zsh-users@sunsite.dk

Hi,

on a Linux system I have set following limits (only) on
/etc/security/limits.conf:

*               soft    core            0
*               hard    core            32768

When I use bash I get this:

$ ulimit -Hc
32768

But with zsh CVS I get this:

$ ulimit -Hc
65536

Both shells should measure core limit as blocks so is there a bug in
zsh or am I missing something?

Thanks.
