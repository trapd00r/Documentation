This has been fixed for quite some time in 4.1.0-dev-X:

2002-05-04  Bart Schaefer  <schaefer@zsh.org>

        * 16613 (modified): acconfig.h, zshconfig.ac, Src/init.c: detect
        variant tgetent() return value and test for it correctly.

I should have taken the lack of feedback about it as indicating it didn't
break anything and ported it across to the branch.
