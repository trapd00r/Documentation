Most "more" programs I've seen don't do terminal clearing -- "less" does 
(and some sysadmins have more just point at less, so maybe less is
really being run).

Anyway, the "less" I have installed on my RedHat-like linux system uses
the environment variable LESS to pass default arguments to the binary,
and an option -X to disable sending of termcap init and deinit strings.
So I do:

export LESS=-X

and less stops clearing my screen on exit.
