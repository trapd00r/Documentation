Subject: completion with midword tildes

In dev-14 and the latest jaist CVS snapshot, at least, complete
will not complete a word containing a tilde if the tilde is
specified.  It will, however, do so if a backslash is specified.
This happens whether or not EXTENDED_GLOB is set. That is to say

% mkdir a~b
% cd a<TAB>   --> cd a\~b
% cd a~<TAB>  --> cd a~<BEEP>
% cd a\<TAB>  --> cd a\~b
% cd a\~<TAB> --> cd a\~b

Some older behavior used to allow

% cd a~<TAB>  --> cd a\~b

Is the old behavior undesirable?  Particularly when EXTENDED_GLOB
is unset, I would expect a~ to complete.
