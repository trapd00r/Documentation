I'd never noticed this before, but "2.7 The Zsh Wiki" is not its own
info node; it doesn't get put on a new page like 2.4, 2.5, and 2.8,
it's on the same page as 2.6.

Of course *none* of the sub-sections of chapters 3, 5, 7, and 9 get
their own nodes/pages, either, although every section of chapter 4 and
6 does.  What is it with odd-numbered chapters?  (Chapter 8 has only
one section, so it doesn't count.)  Oh, 10 has no nodes for sections.

The section numbers in chapter 13 (Prompt Expansion) are wrong, they
start with 13.0.1, 13.0.2, etc., rather than 13.1, 13.2.  And they
predictably don't have their own nodes.

Chapter 14 (Expansion) has a new node/page for every section *and* a
new node/page for every sub-section of 14.1 (History), but does not
have a new node/page for sub-sections of 14.3 (Parameter) or 14.8
(Filename), even though both of those sections are longer than the
section on History.

Someone appears to have mistaken 15 and 19 for even numbers.  This is
not really a problem.

Sections 18.5 and 18.6 do not have nodes/pages even though the other
chapter 18 sections do.  This is particularly bad because 18.6 has a
menu of sub-sections which all get their own nodes, so invoking the
menu in 18.4 gets you the 18.6 sub-sections.  The heading of 18.5.1
is "Special Widget" from the days when zle-line-init was the only one,
but it should probably be plural now.

Chapter 21 looks like it's going to have the 18.6 problem, but then it
turns out that the menu under 21.2 is really for 21.3 through 21.7,
so that's a completely different oddity.

Section 22.23 (zsh/system Builtins) should be 22.22.1, and similarly
for 22.24 / 22.22.2, so all numbering from 22.25 on is out of whack.

24.3 (TCP User Defined Functions) should either be 24.2.5 or should
have its own node and appear in the menu under 24.  Similarly for
24.4 (TCP Utility Functions) / 24.2.6.  Numbers of the succeeding
sections are off if these should not be nodes.  24.6 and 24.7 have
the same problem, they should be 24.5.1 and 24.5.2 (or 24.3.1 and
24.3.2 if the previous problem is fixed, I think).

That's it for structural problems; I don't have time to proofread now.
