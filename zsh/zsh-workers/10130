I understand, for compinit to work I still need to have both source and compiled versions
of completion functions? Some vague idea (probably, a step toward a "real" packaging) - we
already keep quite a lot of information in wordcode files. What about adding a bit more -
general "package name" (package id or how it can be called) and per-package specific
information.

This would allow you to select package functions you want to load, and compinit could
extract the same info as currently from comment. Something like

autoload -P completion

would add all completion functions but not zftp functions. That will still allow you to
install everything by default but select just what is needed.

Of course, package name may be hierarchical ... completion/Debian :-)
