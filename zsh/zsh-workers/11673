I got this report about the 3.0.8 release candidate; since it now has the
same configure.in snippet for RLIM_T_IS_* that 3.1.7 does, I thought I'd
pass it along.

seems to work fine.

Though rlim_t is actually unsigned, and configure seems to find that
it's long_long but not that it's u_long_long. That's probably not
a terribly important bug though.
