I recently reported that on solaris and AIX zsh has the following bug:

% zsh -fc 'echo bug' &
[1] 27312
% <RETURN>
[1]  + suspended (tty output)  zsh -fc 'echo bug'

Actually it is even worse:

% zsh -fc ':' &
[1] 27314
% <RETURN>
[1]  + suspended (tty output)  zsh -fc ':'

This means that zsh scripts cannot be backgrounded at all.
