You'll have to persuade it not to.  I've come to the conclusion it's just
not rational to go through the entire code for zsh turning checking every
single possible occurence of a double slash just because cygwin uses double
slashes for network resources.  Strip the / in .zshenv.

It's a fairly simple shell function, just quite long, and I'd be very, very
happy for anybody else to add some of the 5,000 possible features I'm at
the last count aware of to compinstall.
