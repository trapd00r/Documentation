Hi,

When aliasing a command and running it from CLI, help for the command
(Escape-H) is called for alias expansion, like in:

% portupgrade zsh (type Esc-H)
<manpage for nice appears if you do alias portupgrade='nice portupgrade'>

Strange and unpleasant as well. Any reason to keep it this way?

/S
