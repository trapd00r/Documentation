I don't quite understand how this ever worked...  the exit condition
when parsing zshall doesn't appear to be in the right place.  It
may have been caused by a knock-on effect of another change.  The
following seems to do the right thing, anyway.  The change to the
position of the test is the fix to the problem you're noticing; the
change to the test itself is explained by the comment.

I don't think you're missing anything, we are.  As the files are
functions, they don't *need* to be executable; presumably people have
been adding those that *can* be run stand-alone to the archive as
executable files, but no one's ever bothered to make the installer spot
this.
