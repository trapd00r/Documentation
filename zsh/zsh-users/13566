I'm not aware of one, although it would be a very useful project to
start at zshwiki.org.

However, note that there is a somewhat outdated list of incompabilities
in the zsh FAQ which is online at http://zsh.sunsite.dk/FAQ/ and in the
source archive (which is nowadays the master copy).

The issue you ran across could do with mentioning.
