OK, I misinterpreted... I've certainly no objection to cleverer use of
escape codes for things that can't otherwise be output (where we can
test this, obviously).  I thought you were saying "treat this as a
directly printable character" in both cases.

Passing the character through the appropriate version of nicechar()
ought to help.
