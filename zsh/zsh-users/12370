Yep, it works fine with -f.  But my .zshrc is pretty simple; it's
basically the one created by zsh following the interactive
"first-time user" setup.

I just created a default pristinely new user acct with no .zshrc
and running 'bindkey -v' makes my use case work as expected.

So yes, something is screwy.  I think it's this:

    % bindkey
    ...
    "^[/" _history-complete-older

I have no idea where that cam from, but...

I'm working around it now with this in my .zshrc:

    bindkey '\e/' vi-history-search-backward
