} I think GNU make just finds that there is a zsh bin in the target dir, and
} puts the binary there.

Yeah, I finally located the info file for make (it's not installed on the
machine where I was doing the build).  That is in fact the way VPATH is
defined to work.

However, I wonder if perhaps the zsh rule should override that somehow?
It doesn't seem appropriate in the context in which the zsh build is
using VPATH.
