Well, mostly aesthetic considerations. It is `0' om /dev/tty0 and pts/3 or
term/4 somewhere else. Also, ps usually shows tty line as base name sans
/dev/. And not every Unix is Linux yet to treat /dev/tty* specially.

In short, consistency considerations.

I asked if somebody was against this change. In a couple weeks I got some
personal replies "go ahead" and none said "no". So I committed it. Change
it back if you wish; I guess I just stop using %l in prompt again then :-)
