Subject: PATCH: pws-22: compctl doc points to new completion
Date: Wed, 16 Jun 1999 14:23:45 +0200
From: Peter Stephenson <pws@ibmth.df.unipi.it>

This was almost embarrassing... I knew I'd changed something yesterday and
forgot what.  This tries to reduce user confusion over what sort of
completion to use by prefacing the compctl manual page, which is usually
the first thing on the subject you see, with appropriate remarks.
