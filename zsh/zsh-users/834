Is there a way to change the default message you get when you have new
mail?  That is, a way to prevent the repetition in

    mailpath=('foo?New mail in $_'
    	    	'bar?New mail in $_'
		'baz?New mail in $_')

without doing something like

    for file in foo bar baz
    do
	mailpath=($mailpath "$file?New mail in $file")
    done

and without separating mailboxes out into their own directory?

If there isn't, how about adding one?  A possible syntax would be that
an element of the array which starts with ? would change the default
message from the next element forward.
