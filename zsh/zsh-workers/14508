} Hmm ... output an error message? I mean, ${(...)-} is an $-; but
} ${-blablabla} does not lool like it.

But ${-blablabla} does print an error message:

zsh: bad substitution

The problem with ${(%)-%l} is the leading % sign in the stuff after the
parameter name.  Would you expect ${(%)foo%l} to print an error message?

} Or interpret it as the ${...:-...}?

No, that would be wrong too.
