I am trying to have alpha4v6 take my ten digit telephone numbers from a 
dBase III+ file and fit them into its phone template.  In field rules, I 
define the template and mask and these work fine when entering new phone 
numbers but the formerly entered numbers appear as ten digits with no 
template. Any suggestions will be greatly appreciated.

Thanks!
