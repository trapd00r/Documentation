And the most wonderful thing is that you probably don't need all that 
stuff (alias, function) and simply type "vi [Alt]+[.]" 
("insert-last-word"). Because this is common sequence like 

cat <deletable_file>
rm  <deletable_file>

it doesn't make sense to make aliases or functions for all the 
countless possibilities.
