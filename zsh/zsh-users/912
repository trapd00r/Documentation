That is, because your (otherwise fabulous) operating-system encodes
Ae as 0205, Oe as 0226, Ue as 0232, which codes are in the range 0200
to 0237. This range does not display anything under the latin-1 encoding.

Now:

Peter, I think you're on the wrong road here. The locale settings cannot
change hardware-properties, can they?

Why don't you just pass through all 8-bit-encodings, or possibly add (yet
another) zsh-option, which at least allows this. You simply cannot tell
something about the users hardware. Even if you get everything right so far,
when say, someone changes his/her terminal font or encoding vector, it's
immediately broken again. If at all, these settings belong under complete
user-control. You're asking way too much from the locale system here.

Wolfgang.
