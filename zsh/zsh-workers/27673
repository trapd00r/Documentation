I was wondering if there's some way for completion listings to
indicate the common portion - if there are many similar looking
completions, you want some indication of what characters you can
type next to disambiguate.  I'm imagining maybe some way to
highlight the unmatched portions of the completions - is that
possible?

I really like the removable suffix highlighting, btw!

thanks,
Greg
