If Mutt is also affected, this is probably not a problem due to zsh.

Also if you use ssh, you need the same charmap on both sides.

Could you try the following commands?

  env | grep '^\(LANG\|LC_\)'
  locale

And the following utility:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <locale.h>
#include <langinfo.h>

int main (void)
{
  setlocale (LC_ALL, "");
  printf ("%s\n", nl_langinfo (CODESET));
  return 0;
}

(This is what "locale charmap" should do, but it is broken on Tiger.)
