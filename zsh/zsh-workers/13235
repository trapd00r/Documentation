I'd still like to have configure parameter instead of/in addition to
config.modules as I suggested sometime ago. It is better suited for
scripting. Mau be, I'll get around to implement it. It may even coexist with
config.modules.

To remeber - something like:

--enable-modules='zsh/zle=link=static zsh/stat=load=auto'

i.e. just to enable setting the same parameters as in config.modules on
command line.
