This makes a lot of sense.  I haven't quite understood how this system
handles the difference between `-redirect-2>' and `-redirect-echo-2>'.
Suppose I defined a redirection for the former, will I still get a
context including `-redirect-echo-2>'?  And is that the same for a plain
`-redirect-'?  I would guess yes, since the context depends on what you
are completing rather than what function is doing it (and patterns are a
more natural part of styles than of compdef definitions).

The only worry is that someone, somewhere will decide it's a great idea
to have commands beginning with `-' for some special use.  I don't see
how we can guard against that in general, though.  We can't make the
current set of completion functions indendent of the choice of
character.  We may just as well stick with -.  Maybe we could allow it
to be escaped, like `:' (often) can be.
