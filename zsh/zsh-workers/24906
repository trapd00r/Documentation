fwiw, i'd like to second this, i've been meaning to ask it for a while
but didn't get around to it. My widget looks like this:

autoload -U narrow-to-region
function _narrow_to_region_marked()
{
  local right
  local left
  if ((MARK == 0)); then
    zle set-mark-command
  fi
  if ((MARK < CURSOR)); then
    left="$LBUFFER[0,$((MARK-CURSOR-1))]"
    right="$RBUFFER"
  else
    left="$LBUFFER"
    right="$BUFFER[$((MARK+1)),-1]"
  fi
  narrow-to-region -p "$left>>|" -P "|<<$right"
}

I'd like to replace the "MARK == 0" with "is there an active region?".
