Interesting, I would have expected match-words-by-style to be a bit
more clever about this case (e.g., I didn't expect "Makefile" to
be split into "M" and "akefile" in matched_words, although now that
I see it I'm not entirely sure what I would want instead, and it is
in fact possible to detect this situation from $matched_words).

} Is there a way to modify Bart's above function so that expansion of 
} global aliases is only done when the cursor is at the end of the line 
} (or not "in" a word)?

Yes, change [[ -n $ga ]] to

    [[ -n $ga && ( -n $matched_words[4] || -z $matched_words[5] ) ]]
