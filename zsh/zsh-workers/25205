And while we're at it, it can also do an "unfunction echo" and
"unalias echo" because someone might have redefined "echo" in
the ~/.zshenv to behave POSIXly. But first, it may want to do a
\comm"a"n\d un\function unfunction because you never know these
days what people may want to put in ~/.zshenv.

Let's be serious please. Or let's do as for csh, where one must
add the -f to the shebang line to avoid this kind of problem.

~/.zshenv can be a useful tool but it must be used with care.
