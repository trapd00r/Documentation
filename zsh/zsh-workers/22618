Hi, zsh workers!

The fg, fg_bold associative array and bg and bg_bold in the
colors function are quite useful.

For _prompts_ i have to surround every variable with %{ %} which
does not , aehem, look too nice.
what do you think? would it be fine to have that with
wrapped around %{ %} , too so that not everybody has to put
these around the keys or roll a prompt_colors_array on his
own?

I think, i would love to be able to just use
PS1=$pbg[red]%~ ...
and it just works out of the box in every zsh.

Bad idea?

        Matthias
