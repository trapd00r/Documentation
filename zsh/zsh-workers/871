In ternary expressions, close parens can no longer be escaped with \.
The \ is treated as a normal character, and the close paren ends the
ternary expression.  You can get a literal ) by using the new %)
sequence.  (If I were designing this from scratch, ) would be taken
literally, and %) would close the ternary.  Unfortunately it's too late
for that; this solution breaks the least code.)
