} The rest of the hunks remove explanation strings from calls to
} _arguments or _alternative in cases where the called action-function
} will eventually supply a more accurate one. This prevents messages

} only `removed file' was really attempted. Are there other side-effects

Yes, there were.  `*::_cvs_files' is interpreted as `*::_cvs_files: '
which of course will never do.  Is there _any_ way to specify an empty
message with the `*:...' form of _arguments spec?
