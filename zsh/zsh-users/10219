Probably, but the trouble is there's no single "largest possible".
We've just run into a similar problem with the maximum size of arrays.
If it doesn't crash the shell, it's potentially useful, but we don't
know a priori how large that is.  Some checks on malloc might help, but
that's a big can of worms, too:  once you need it in one place, you need
it all over.  Furthermore, I've got a feeling that on many virtual
memory systems the malloc might succeed but cause havoc later.
