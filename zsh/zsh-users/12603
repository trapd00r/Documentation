} Actually, you can accept lines with either of alt-a, ctrl-o, ctrl-j,
} ctrl-m and alt-x (and possibly more that i haven't thought of :).

Alt-x ?  For me that invokes execute-named-cmd, which still needs yet
another accept-* at the end.

% bindkey -L | fgrep accept
bindkey "^J" accept-line
bindkey "^M" accept-line
bindkey "^O" accept-line-and-down-history
bindkey "^[A" accept-and-hold
bindkey "^[a" accept-and-hold

In viins/vicmd modes you get only ^J and ^M.
