I'm not sure when this broke.

yodl -o ../../Doc/zsh.1 -I../../Doc -w zman.yo version.yo ../../Doc/zsh.yo
Can't read `../../Doc/zsh.yo'

The reason it can't read that file is because it's looking in the wrong
directory:

open("../../Doc/zshzle.1", O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC, 0666) = 3
open("../../Doc/zshzle.idx", O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC, 0666) = 4
getcwd("/tmp/zsh-beta-4.3.5-dev-0+20080226/obj/Doc", 300) = 43
stat64("/tmp/zsh-beta-4.3.5-dev-0+20080226/obj/Doc/../../Doc/../../Doc/zshzle.yo", 0xbfde2044) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
stat64("/tmp/zsh-beta-4.3.5-dev-0+20080226/obj/Doc/../../Doc/../../Doc/zshzle.yo.yo", 0xbfde2044) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
write(2, "Can\'t read `../../Doc/zshzle.yo\'", 32Can't read `../../Doc/zshzle.yo

As one might expect,
yodl -o ../../Doc/zsh.1 -I../../Doc -w zman.yo version.yo Doc/zsh.yo
works.  I wouldn't expect -I to achieve that effect, and I suspect that
older versions behaved in the way the build system seems to expect, so
I'm going to file a bug on yodl.
