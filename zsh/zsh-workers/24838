This patch broke _backward-delete-to-/ for me. It was posted here some
time back, here's the file I use: http://mika.l3ib.org/s/dot-delete-to

Without the patch, on the commandline
foo bar/baz\ blarg
when i press ctrl-w i first get "foo bar/" and then "foo ", with the
patch i get "foo bar/baz\", "foo bar" and "foo".
