    Hi Eike :)

    compctl may be deprecated, but for simple uses like yours (or
mine) is IMHO much better suited than the compsys thing. Stick to it
until compctl is removed (which I hope never happens)...

    Writing the simple completions I've set up with compctl using
compsys would be a nightmare for me. With compsys I feel like using a
hammer to crack nuts: not only excessive, it also doesn't have the
desired effect... A personal opinion, of course, but...
