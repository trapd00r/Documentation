}     not knowing the internals of the history expansion, what is the
}     probability of nested expansion appearing in zsh?

In particular I'm concerned about the default (non-CSH_JUNKIE) history
behavior:

 By default, a history reference with no event designator refers to the
 same event as any preceding history reference on that command line; if
 it is the only history reference in a command, it refers to the previous
 command.

Within a nested expression, which references "precede" which others?  If yet
another history reference follows (in a separate word) a nested reference,
which of the subexpressions of the nested reference determines which event
is used by that second reference?

(If this thread continues, it should be moved to zsh-workers.)
