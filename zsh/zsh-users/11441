Subject: Different tags for _arguments

I would like to break up the different options that can be given to a
command into several tags.  This to show that certain options come
from one command and other are passed on to commands run by this first
command.

For git-shortlog, only two options are defined for git-shortlog as
such, -n and -s.  However, it passes on everything else to
git-rev-list (not technically true any more, but they still use the
same set of options).  There's a bunch of options to git-rev-list
(closing on a hundred), so it would be neat if one could list the -n
and -s options first, under a separate tag and description, like
"native options", and the rest of the options under a separate tag and
description, like "output options".

Can this be done?

Thanks.
