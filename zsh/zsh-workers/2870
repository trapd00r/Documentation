The `acting as if set' variable was termok: this is supposed to get
set to TERM_NOUP if the terminal can't go up and to TERM_BAD if the
terminal can't be used.  The idea behind it was exactly that if
SINGLE_LINE_ZLE was not explicitly set and the terminal became a fully
usable sort then it would behave as if the option was unset again. I
don't see why termok and shortterm shouldn't be merged together, they
seem to be doing more or less the same thing.  In fact, if I remember
right setting termok to TERM_NOUP should have the effect desired of
shortterm.  (If not, it's not doing its job properly anyway.)
