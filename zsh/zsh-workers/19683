Are you runing over a problem I sometimes have with cygwin that zwarnnam
doesn't get linked into modules properly and the shell crashes when a
module tries to call it?  If so, it's not just me and it should be
reported.  You should be able to see warnings about trying to import
zwarnnam as a data symbol.

It seems that the last symbol in the export list is not scanned properly
by dlltool.  My simple-minded workaround is to add another one even later.
(Remake until the warnings go away.  I'm not sure if the dependencies
are quite up to this.)
