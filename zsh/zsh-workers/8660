Hi,

I sent this to zsh-users and got no response. Can zsh-workers be a more
appropriate group for the post?

All the best,

Zvi.

Subject: Distribution Tar File Too Big

Hi,

The distribution tar files of zsh, since version 3.0.6, are twice as big as
they should be:
-rw-r--r--   1 rl       rl         655790 Sep 26  1997 zsh-3.0.5.tar.gz
-rw-r--r--   1 rl       rl        1166968 Aug  1 18:46 zsh-3.0.6.tar.gz
-rw-r--r--   1 rl       rl        1171925 Oct 19 09:46 zsh-3.0.7.tar.gz
(the listing is from my mirror, but the original sizes are the same).

The reason for that is when they generated, the tar script somehow included
each file twice! Just by untarring and re-tarring, you get:
-rw-r-----   1 rl       rl         652631 Nov 15 14:09 zsh-3.0.5.tar.gz
-rw-r-----   1 rl       rl         647759 Nov 15 14:10 zsh-3.0.6.tar.gz
-rw-r-----   1 rl       rl         649918 Nov 15 14:10 zsh-3.0.7.tar.gz
(the small difference in size in 3.0.5 is because of the compression level,
but notice the big difference in 3.0.6 and 3.0.7!)

All the best,

Zvi.
