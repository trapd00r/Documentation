Indeed, `make install.man' did it... thanks! Still, it's strange -- I
would expect `make' and `make install' to do the right thing, which they
obviously didn't for me (although I checked the man pages after `make'
and `make install' and their modification time indicated that they were
newly generated, neither those in the respository nor those installed in
my man directories contained the new section. Only `make install.man'
seems to have actually regenerated the manual pages).

Thank you and sorry for the noise
