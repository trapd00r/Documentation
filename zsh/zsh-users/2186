I have tried this on 3.0.5 running under both Red Hat and HPUX and can't
reproduce your bug. I assume that the mistakes in this are typos - you don't
make a directory with a space on the end like you said you would, and then
when you try to cd to it, the backslashes in the wrong place (and cd would
have complained of "too many arguments" if this was how it really
happened...). Nevertheless, I have tried all sorts of combinations and can't
get anything resembling your bug.

I haven't got 3.1.5 handy, but I tried it on an AIX machine with 3.1.4 and
again no joy. Perhaps there is something strange with your setup?
