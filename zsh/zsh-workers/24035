:How comprehensive is the test suite, and are there any major gotchas?

------------------------------------------------------------
2007-05-06 01:47  packersv

        * Test/B03print.ztst (1.8.2.1): Merge through trunk revision 1.19
          for 21352, 22758, 23086, 23118, 23119 and a few unposted.
------------------------------------------------------------

23118/23119 weren't brought in.  Are you planning on this still?

./C03traps.ztst fails for me on "Nested `trap ... INT', not triggered".

I'm still looking through the recent stuff (last six weeks or so) so I
may have more questions.

How big is the list of what remains to be done?

Regards,
Geoff
