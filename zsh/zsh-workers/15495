Yuk.  Whoever decided on this has got a job on their hands.

Typeset is going to get *very* confused.  Each change like this multiplies,
rather than adds to, the complexity of the already complicated typeset
code.  When you add to this the restore sequence, which is handled at the
end of function scope with no detailed knowledge of what typeset has been
up to, you've got something very difficult to maintain (which, personally,
I'm not proposing to attempt).  Good luck.
