Subject: Question about the Zsh History event number

Hello Folks,

I am new to Zsh (have moved to Zsh recently from BASH). I am loving it
so far. I was playing around with my prompt. I have set the PROMPT
variable as

export PROMPT=3D"[%m %h] %1d =A0> "

I have one small issue, the history event number is not resetting to 1
when I start a new shell. Is this expected (at least in BASH this used
to reset to 1 in a new shell).

Any suggestions ? Thanks for your help.

Regards,
Vikas
