One regression from my original incomplete version is that -Z and -M
take devicename=filename pairs, which I assumed was covered by the
_mkisofs_pathspec function, even though that is obviously not the case.
I've incorporated the glob from Nikolai's version this time around.

Also, what's going on with the /dev/pts/7 and /dev/pts/8 stuff?
