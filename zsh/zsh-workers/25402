Umm, the argument to return is interpreted as a math expression.  So for
example

	x=-3
	return -x

returns "3", and

	x=3
	return --x

returns "2".  How are you going to make any kind of option parsing for
return behave compatibly with that? 

} (In fact, the lack of option parsing, even --, in return is strictly a
} bug, so this even makes it more compatible with other shells.)

It'd have to be only in emulation mode, then.
