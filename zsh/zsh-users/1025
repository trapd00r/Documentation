	okay, so i've been using zsh for a couple of years now, and i know that
i've been barely scratching the surface of what it (or any other shell) can
do.  so i've decided to actually dig in and start _doing_ things with the
shell, starting with bindkey, which i've seen lots about but never actually
used.
	i'm assuming that bindkey is what i would use to do the following
extremely trivial task, for example, but have no idea how to do so: i'd
like to be able to map the control+(left arrow) and control+(right arrow)
keys to the sequences "ESC-b" and "ESC-w", respectively (so that, with
VISUAL set to 'vi', they move the cursor one word to the left/right.
	so where would i go about figuring out how to do this in bindkey?  is
there a faq?  i couldn't find a man page, though that could just be the
fault of the poor man pages on my server.

	tia,
	sweth.
