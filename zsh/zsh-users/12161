My path is a bit huge given all the OSs I've used:

set -A path \
        ~/bin \
        /usr/local/stow/bin \
        /bin /usr/bin/ /usr/X11R6/bin /usr/pkg/bin /sbin /usr/sbin  \
        /usr/local/bin/ /usr/bin \
        /usr/* /usr/local/sbin /usr/local/gphoto/bin \
        /sbin /usr/sbin /usr/X11R6/bin \
        /Volumes/local/pkgsrc/pkg/bin \
        /opt/ghc/bin \
        /usr/kde/3.5/bin \
        ~/{bin,Perl,scripts,haskell,C}

On slowlaris I have an extra
export PATH=$HOME/bin:/usr/ccs/bin:/opt/SUNWspro/bin:/usr/local/bin:$PATH
as well.

Personally I would say get used to the real world where -i doesn't always
exist and therefore should *never* exist. Get used to it - when you type
rm, things disappear ;)

If you want a shorter way to unalias something as a one-off, \rm would work.

And you could always do 
uname | grep SunOS > /dev/null && unalias rm

or adapt your non-working check on OSTYPE above, perhaps?
