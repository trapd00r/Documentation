There was a letter `é' in the message I quoted.  My mail client
(elm-2.4ME+) scans the message for characters with 8th bit set and if it
finds one it automatically uses 8bit, quoted-printable or base64 encoding
(it uses quoted-printable only if I tell it during compile time that my MTA
does not support 8bit, and it uses base64 if more the percentage of 8th bit
set characters is high).

When I read a message, quoted-printable or base64 is seemlessly converted
on the fly by elm.
