This is related to export foo=$(cmd) problem we have discussed. Obviously,
other shells treat {export|local|typeset} foo=bar w.r.t. word splitting
exactly the same as foo=bar, i.e. they do not split in assignments here.

Did not we have some patch for it, at least in HEAD? Looks, like it should
be in 4.0.
