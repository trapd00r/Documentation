By putting '/' in WORDCHARS, you're telling Zsh that those are characters 
that can be found in words. So, "abcd/efgh" is a single word. You want 
WORDCHARS to *not* include "/", since you want the words to be "abcd" and 
"efgh". (Words might be "abcd", "/", and "efgh", in that case -- not sure 
if non-word chars constitute words.)

Best,
Ben
