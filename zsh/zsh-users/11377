Hi,

 how can I read line by line from a file of text?

 I tried

 while theline in `cat results.txt`
 do
     echo ${theline}
     echo "----------------"
 done

 and got a new echo on every _blank_ seperated word and 
 not a every new line seperated by a newline.

 Thank you very much for any help in advance!
 Keep zshing!
 mcc
