May be it was discussed already, but is not mapfile module alternative to
$(...)? We mostly need it to parse files content, as in $(</etc/printcap), and
in this case we could just as well mmap the file.

And where the "real" $(...) is needed, we cannot cache it anyway (process list
is an example).

Is there any system now-a-days without mmap support?
