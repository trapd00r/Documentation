} How about this patch? It makes _diff_is_gnu an assoc of $words[1] and
} it makes $words[1] be used as the command if it matches *diff. That
} last part -- or at least the pattern -- may have to be changed: are
} there other commands ending in `diff' that are not real diffs and that 
} may be in $words[1] when _diff_options is used?

There's rcsdiff, of course, and also mgdiff and zdiff.  All of those are
"diff wrappers" that take the args to pass along to the real "diff".
