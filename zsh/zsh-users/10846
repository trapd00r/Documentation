This does not work in the general case since I don't know at the time of
invoking
bash, whether I will eventually just go back one level or logout
completely.=20
Imagine the following situation:

  rlogin foo
  VAR=3Dval1
  exec bash
  VAR=3Dval2

Now if at this point I would decide to not logout, but just go up one
level (in order
to have the old value of VAR restored), there is no way to do it -
typing exit would
log me out *unconditionally*.
