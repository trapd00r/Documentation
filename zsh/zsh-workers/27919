I've reported the following bug in Debian. It also occurs
under Mac OS X.

After a "zsh -f":

% alias my_echo=echo
% false
% true &
% my_ech[TAB]

A succession of [ESC] . (bound to insert-last-word) gives:

  my_echo&
  my_echo&&
  my_echo&false

while I would expect:

  my_echo &
  my_echo false

or even better:

  my_echo true
  my_echo false

i.e. the "&" should be ignored by insert-last-word.
