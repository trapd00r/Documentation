Somewhere, someone would break.  That's almost a given.

But with a proper notice, maybe it would be okay?  I think it would make
sense to keep a list of (non-bug) incompatibilities somewhere in the
distribution so that people would have a definitive place to find out
why their stuff isn't working anymore.

But it still makes it harder to incorporate zsh in a distribution that
strives for backwards compatibility.  :(
