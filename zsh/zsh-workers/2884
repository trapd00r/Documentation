Esteemed colleagues:
	When I login with 3.1.1, I have a '/' at the end of my
dir. When I change to directories under that, CWD is '/home/foo//bar'
and I can't edit anything because a '//' is not allowed in a directory
name. The system is Intel-based Linux. Problem started when I upgraded
to 3.1.1. In another account, I have the shell set as zsh-3.0.3 and it
works fine.
