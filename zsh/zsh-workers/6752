Wow! I was tempted to ask for it long long time ... but I always had a feeling,
that zsh-workers are more of the old Unix teletype guys :-)

Is it possible to transparently use menu-select instead of menu-complete? I
mean, I currently have TAB bound to complete-word with additional stuff like
menu et al governed by configuration keys. Can I still use menu-select in this
case? Some configuration key to use menu-select instead of menu-complete
transparently ...
