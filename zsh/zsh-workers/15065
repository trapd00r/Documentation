It does, look at the sprintf()s, they all have a space at the beginning
so that concatenating them with dyncat() makes it look right and we
don't have a space at the end of the string.

It concatenates its arguments in `dynamic' memory, i.e., in
heap-allocated memory (a zsh heap, not the system-heap).
