We should at least address 219457 and 219459 before 4.0.1, not because I
submitted them, but because they're shell-crashers.

I suspect 232305 has already been taken care of by the configure system,
but can somebody who has a Solaris box please check?

The others can all be put off, unless Adam wants to go crazy with 204884.
