I think that means the function won't do what it's designed to do,
right?  So in that case we should test if readlink accepts -f and if it
doesn't, then return immediately.  However, that may not be a trivial
test.  How about something like

[[ -n $(readlink -f / 2>&1 >/dev/null) ]]

(for which we could cache the result)?  Or is testing that
"readlink -f / >&/dev/null" returns status 0 good enough?
