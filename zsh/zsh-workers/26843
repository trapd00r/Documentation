I know nothing about zsh.docsrc.org, but I think the sourceforge pages
you're talking about are mirrors of the ones at zsh.sunsite.dk; I don't
know whether mirroring is automated.  I don't know who, if any, thinks
they're in charge of updating the ones at sunsite.dk at the moment.  Maybe
they'll own up.
