Is anyone able to update the manual at the web site (zsh.sunsite.dk) to
4.2.0? It looks like I updated it in March, but I have no time for this
kind of thing so even if I do it this time it will get out of data again.

If anyone does have time, it would be good to indicate the relevant
version of zsh on the top level.  It seems to be fairly well buried in
the HTML version (in fact, I can't find it after a cursory examination).

Thanks.
pws
