;-) Yes, it is confusing. I was referring to it not completing normal
arguments. Since the --install isn't repeated, it is taken as the only 
argument (the pattern to -A is really only used by the -A mechanism).
I hadn't seen that it doesn't complete options either... hm, that may
have something to do with multiple sets or something, I'll have a look 
(together with the diff-thing).


Bye
