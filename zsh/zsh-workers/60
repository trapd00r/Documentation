Hi !

I've written some very cool IMHO WWW cgi-bin using the zsh, and I needed
to have the name of a temporary file.  Unfortunately, this is only
possible with <(), so I tried

  tempfile = `echo <(:)`

This HANGS !!  (Sparc 20, Solaris 2.4, zsh 2.5.03, and
HP-UX with zsh 2.6beta7)

Now I resorted to

  echo <(:) | read tempfile

This hangs the shell, too, if it is not interactive. (Strange, isn't it ?)

My last resort was /tmp/zsh$$.  This works for now.

Felix

(I'd suggest something like $TEMPFILE or so)
