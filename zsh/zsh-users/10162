Hello,

I started using aptitude recently and noticed that the completion for
some commands were not behaving as expected, so I made some trivial
changes to the _aptitude file.

Note that (un)markauto are meant to be used on *installed* packages,
and so I moved them into the appropriated group. Ideally they should
complete on "unmarked/marked" packages, the list of marked packages is
available through

aptitude -F"%p"  search \~M

but (i) that's a bit slow and (ii) I couldn't figure a way to include
this in the completion function (in the 5min I spent trying that is...)

I reckon that some options I just turned ON allow things like
packagename=version and that is not being done, yet "aptitude install"
also allows for things like "~nzsh" and that's not implemented either;
so I concluded that it was OK to do it so.

Cheers,
