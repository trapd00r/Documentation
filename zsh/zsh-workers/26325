If the NO_SH_WORD_SPLIT default is only to be the source of subtle
bugs and not actually useful, then it should be removed.

I cannot believe it's widely used, except in legacy scripts that
predate array parameters.  Why would you put an empty string into a
variable unless you wanted it there?  I don't see any reason you'd
ever want the current behavior in a new script, and any existing
script should just emulate to the broken behavior.
