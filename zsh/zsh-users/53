We're installing a central server and departmental servers here, and
there's a discussion about which shell should be the default. People
are trying to choose between tcsh and bash. Tcsh is more compatible
with other unix sites, and bash has the advantage of a uniform
language for interactive and programming use.

Obviously zsh fills both tasks, and has good support, since most bugs
posted here usually get a fix pretty soon. However it still has a lot
of bugs. Since the bugs are not easy to tickle, I wonder if it would
stand being the default shell for hundreds of users, a whole
institute. This is a big responsibility.

Can you out there make a comparison or give an opinion?

Carlos
