Maybe we're getting closer after all... can you run
  build_tooldir=/usr/local/sparc-sun-solaris2.6
  ./xgcc -B./ -B$build_tooldir/bin/ -isystem $build_tooldir/include \
-isystem $build_tooldir/sys-include --print-multi-lib

in the gcc directory and see what that gives?  This should be what's
being passed down as MULTILIBS.  You're build_tooldir will be different
--- it's usually just the path to the binaries with bin stripped,
followed by the configuration name.  I don't know if it's relevant at
this point, possibly not.  (Possibly GCC_FOR_TARGET is different at this
point; that's everything from ./xgcc up to sys-include, in which case
this might not be the right argument.  If you can see a value of
GCC_FOR_TARGET being passed down into the system at that point, that's
the one to use.)
