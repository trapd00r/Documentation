    Hi Ronald :)

    Try this:

    eval whatevercommand \''$file'\'

    As for doing the same without eval, it can be done, too, by
setting the sh_word_split option and tweaking, or simply with this:

    options=("-x")
    (($#)) && options=("-y" "$1")
    CMD $options[1] $options[2] foo

    If "foo" comes from a parameter, just use that parameter instead
of "foo".

    I haven't tested the solution, so it may need some refinement,
but it should do.
