You can use <-> syntax to get some of the way.  It falls down if you need
to be strict about leading zeroes, however: if you really insist that
00 matches and 0 doesn't it won't help you.  I suppose I could extend it so
that <00-999> matched a two- or three-digit number (making leading zeroes
significant for the comparison on the left), but that doesn't fix the
general problem.

I will have a look at how difficult quantifiers are, but the syntax will be
different since braces are already used:  probably something like an
extended globbing flag (#c2,3).
