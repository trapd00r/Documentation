"The Zsh development group" is defined earlier in the licence. Also, it
is important that the disclaimer of warranty applies to everyone who has
ever contributed as much as one line of code and not just the core
developers. The GPL uses "any copyright holder, or any other party who
may modify and/or redistribute the program as permitted above".

Another thing which seems a little odd in the zsh licence is the bit
which says "without licence".
