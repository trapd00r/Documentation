[...]

Think of:

double() {
  REPLY=$(($1 * 2))
}

square() {
  REPLY=$(($1 ** 2))
}

Where those functions are meant to be passed a number, positive
or negative, not any random arithmetic expression.

If you make ** have higher precedence than unary "-", then
square -1

returns -1

while double -1 returns -2 as expected.
