Just an observation:

I think adding a menu or similar listing somewhere of the breakdown of the
options into groupings would have been a fine idea, but I think that doing
it for the descriptions themselves makes it needlessly difficult to find
individual option descriptions, because they're no longer in alphabetical
order (except within groups, which may not be obvious when one is looking
at a screenful of the text in the middle of a subsection).
