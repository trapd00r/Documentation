[lots of remarkably helpful info snipped]

It continually staggers me how helpful the zsh-users are.  So many
times I've seen a simple question asked, and answers come back in
glorious detail.  Thanks Bart and everyone else for this; I think it's
a huge asset to zsh.

Nothing more complex than being able type `restart' to restart the
shell exactly how it was invoked.  Currently I have

  restart () {
      exec $SHELL "$SHELL_ARGS" "$@"
  }

and I do

  export SHELL_ARGS="$@"

in my ~/.switch_shell (run from bash).
