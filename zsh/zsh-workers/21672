As it's a sort of array, you need braces.  However, you also need
to copy keys as well as values.  The syntax is:

typeset -A counterfeit
counterfeit=(${(kv)homemade})

Make sure you don't have the option SH_WORD_SPLIT set.  (This is a
classic example of why it's a good idea to get used to doing without it.)
