CygWin yes. I have two PCs both were running Cygwin/zsh just fine.
However the .zshenv files were out of sync, so i am trying to make them 
duplicates with a 
if [[ "$LOGNAME" != davidr ]]  line allowing for variants . 
When I copied the .zshenv from my New PC (Vista) to my Old PC (XP) then I 
started to get the "Secure Message" for evey little script I run.

(The grep error message only occurs when the shell starts so that's not 
urgent. )

There is obviously a difference between the zsh configuration /modules both 
are zsh 4.3.4 (i686-pc-cygwin)
