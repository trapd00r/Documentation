yup, I've fixed that

There was a problem pointed out by Zoli with $* which still applies to
$==*, namely if you have cd as a function and want to do `cd foo ""'
the null string gets dropped, and it means something completely
different.  There is now a mention of the difference between "$@" and
$* in the shwordsplit section.  I can point out about $==*, if you
don't think it's going to make people's hair stand on end.
