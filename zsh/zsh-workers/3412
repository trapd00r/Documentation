Hiya,

I'm had this trouble installing zsh here.  This was compiled on an
ultrasparc running Solaris 5.5.

Thanks,

Maybe.  Try mawk or gawk -- both of them handle the script fine.  Also,
please send a bug report to <zsh-workers@math.gatech.edu> -- there will
be some awk experts there that can fix the script.
