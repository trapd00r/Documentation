Hi,

 ...oh sorry..I think I have caused more confusion as I had
 intended...:)

 The script was speculativ (and buggy)...just a thought written down
 in an email.

 The corrected script is:

    #!/bin/zsh
    function zipcmp ()
    {
     cmp -s <(7z x -so $1 2>/dev/null ) <(7z x -so $2 2>/dev/null )    
    }
       
    
    if zipcmp $1 $2
    then
     echo "$1 and $2 are identical..."
    fi

 which works fine for me.

 When I will struggle again about similiar things, an email will be on
 the way... :O)

 If you find any bug or things to improve in the above script, please
 email me...I will use this script as a base for a
 compare-files-and-remove-doubles-script...


 Happy zshing!
 Meino
