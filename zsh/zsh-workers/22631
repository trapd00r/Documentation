That would be on this line:

  local _compdir=${fpath[(r)*/$ZSH_VERSION/*]}

} compinit:469: bad pattern: _i_test[=yes

Interesting; that's on:

      _i_test[$_i_name]=yes

} colors:39: bad substitution

Maybe zsh has a problem with function names that begin with "co". :-)
Seriously, this is pretty clearly a problem with subscript parsing.

for k in ${(k)color}; do color[${color[$k]}]=$k; done

} The error messages are issued at zsh startup.  4.3.2-20060619 snapshot
} did not have such a problem.

In all cases the parse of the subscript appears to have run one byte
too far and consumed the ']'.  What operating system and compiler are
you using?

I can't reproduce any of these with my build of 08/17 sources from CVS.
I've tried compiling both with and without multibyte support.  I've even
tried forcing Test/D07multibyte.ztst to use ru_RU.UTF-8 as $LANG when
running "make check".

Does anything change if you run "zsh -o posix_identifiers"?  Have you
tried building with "configure --disable-multibyte"?

Changes between 06/19 and 07/29 that may have affected this:

        * 22518: Src/params.c, Src/utils,c, Src/zsh.h,
        Test/B02typeset.ztst: Initial go at making parameter subscripts
        use multibyte characters.

        * 22524: Src/params.c, Test/D07multibyte.ztst: searchable
        subscripts with multibyte characters.

        * 22544: README, Doc/Zsh/options.yo, Src/builtin.c, Src/glob.c,
        Src/lex.c, Src/math.c, Src/module.c, Src/options.c, Src/params.c,
        Src/parse.c, Src/subst.c, Src/utils.c, Src/zsh.h, Src/ztype.h,
        Src/Zle/compcore.c, Src/Zle/zle_tricky.c, Test/D07multibyte.ztst:
        Improve use of ztype tests for multibyte characters.  Add
        POSIX_IDENTIFIERS option to control allowability of multibyte
        alphanumeric characters in parameter and module names.

        * 22556: Doc/Zsh/builtins.yo, Functions/Zle/insert-composed-char,
        Src/builtin.c, Src/pattern.c, Src/subst.c, Src/utils.c, Src/zsh.h,
        Src/ztype.h, Src/Zle/zle.h, Src/Zle/zle_main.c,
        Test/D04parameter.ztst, Test/D07multibyte.ztst: Multibyte
        separators and delimiters.

        * unposted: Src/pattern.c, Src/utils.c: minor typos in
        22556 found when MULTIBYTE_SUPPORT is not defined.

        * 22557: Doc/Zsh/options.yo, Misc/globtests, Src/options.c,
        Src/pattern.c, Test/D02glob.ztst, Test/D07multibyte.ztst:
        Turn on multibyte option by default for MULTIBYTE_SUPPORT and fix
        tests and patterns.
