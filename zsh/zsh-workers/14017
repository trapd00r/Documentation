There were a series of patches (zsh-workers 13922, 13934, 13936, 13961,
13965, 13972) that appeared after the 4.0.1-pre-3 tarball was released,
to address similar problems.  Does your patch apply before or after those=

other patches?  That is, are you building zsh from the tarball or from
the CVS sources on SourceForge?
