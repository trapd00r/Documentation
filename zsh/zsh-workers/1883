I always set SHELL to /bin/sh explicitly in Makefiles.  GNU standards
recommend this too.  This is really an example of the now deeply
ingrained double usage of SHELL -- to specify the preferred interactive
shell and the standard shell.  Too many programs confuse the two
concepts and end up using $SHELL (zsh in my case) when they really want
a Bourne shell (/bin/sh on every Unix system I've ever heard of).
