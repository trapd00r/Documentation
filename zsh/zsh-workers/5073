Could somebody who's managed to keep track of all this stuff (Sven?  Peter?)
please post a complete summary for _both_ zle -c and zle -C of

  * the new commands (compadd, complist, compcall, etc.)
  * the new variables (what's in them and when they're available)
  * the parameters passed to a user's shell functions in each case

Unfortunately, I haven't had time to study Sven's posts enough to do it.

A whole lot of stuff has gone by recently that sounds good in the abstract
but that feels, in Sven's words, "rather hackish."  If it were all written
down in one place it might become obvious how it could all be made to fit
together better.
