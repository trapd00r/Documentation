} Would it be O.K. to get rid of autoconf 2.13 compatibility? 

Well, I'd rather you didn't, but I'm a throwback to the stone age because
I insist on using this email program I wrote that will stop working if I
upgrade my operating system ...

Nevertheless there are a lot of RedHat 6.2 systems out there and RedHat
has not seen fit to upgrade the autoconf RPM for it, so you're likely to
generate a lot of "why can't I build zsh?" questions from people who try
to use the latest CVS stuff from sourceforge.
