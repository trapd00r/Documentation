} Is seems that any calls to trashzle() from within
} zerr() or zerrnam() when called from init.c
} result in a segmentation fault.

Some instructions on how to reproduce this might help.  "zerr() from init.c"
isn't very useful.

} This occurs in zsh 3.1.x

Including 3.1.5-pws-7, announced here on zsh-workers recently?
