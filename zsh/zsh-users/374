Someone reported that zsh does not compile under HP-UX 10.10 because
there are some unknown limits, but someone else wrote that for him
zsh-3.0.0 compiled without problems under HP-UX 10.10.  If you use
HP-UX 10.10 tell me what compiler you use and tell me if you had
problems compiling zsh.

Thanks,

Zoltan
