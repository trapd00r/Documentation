I'm not familiar with zsh internals, but I think ESC-h (in the default  
bindings) is bound to the ZLE widget 'run-help' which calls the  
function "run-help" as "run-help $1". So "man $@:t" in the function is  
equivalent to "man $1:t" if called from the widget.

I believe most people use the run-help function via key binding, but  
there is a possibility that someone use it by explicitly typing it. Or  
by "alias m=run-help" and "m history", "m 3 printf" etc.
