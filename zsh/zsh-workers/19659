It's true!  My system can execute at 101% efficiency!  Sounds like
something taken from michaelscomputers.com [1] perhaps, but here's what
a timing of grep gave:

::: dir: ~ :: user: pcp@puritan :::
time grep -c 'a*' test.file
1
grep -c 'a*' test.file: real: 1.212 user: 1.140 system: 0.090 (101%)
::: dir: ~ :: user: pcp@puritan :::


I don't know if anyone really cares, but there seems to be a seldom
occuring rounding error perhaps?

::: dir: ~ :: user: pcp@puritan :::
zsh --version
zsh 4.2.0-pre-1 (i686-pc-linux-gnu)

If that's of any help.  (Sorry, but don't know if there's any better way
to generate debugging information.)
