Or, if this is the problem, you can reduce it to reordering a list of
file names (in an editor would be best, though you could do it
with "IFS=$'\n' vared array").

# Get the list of files as currently ordered
array1=(*)
# Output one per line to a file
print -l $array1 >file
# Edit the file.  Just reorder the lines the way you want.
vi file
# Put the ordered files into a new array
array2=(${(f)"$(<file)"})
# Sanity check
(( ${#array1} != ${#array2} )) && print 'Wrong number of files!'
# Rename files into a subdirectory, which
# prevents overwriting.  (This is paranoia if
# your are adding numbers.)
mkdir newnames
# Use 3 digit numbers (arbitrary).
integer -Z 3 i
typeset name
# For each file in the required order...
for (( i = 1; i <= ${#array2}; i++ )); do
   name=$array2[i]
   # Move into the subdirectory tagged with the new position as index.
   mv $name newnames/${i}_$name
done
