I tried to submit a (possible) bug, but what I do not like, that I have
to have a logon there. Else bug comes from none. Normally, I have a
field to enter mail address. It cannot be expected, that every user that
wants to submit a bug report will get login - that means, you have no
way to communicate with submitter.

I presume, this bug manager is intended for the end users in the first
place.
