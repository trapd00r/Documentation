Fine, but ... :-)

In this case the return value of get_user_var() is a pointer to the
stored array itself, so the array shouldn't be modified.  The present
code does a mischief to the value of $cdpath after the completion is
finished.  The patch below fixes it (I can even do this one myself).

This works fine.  I don't think it's suprising that there are small
bugs left, it was a major change to the most complicated part of the
shell (possibly the most complicated part of any shell).
