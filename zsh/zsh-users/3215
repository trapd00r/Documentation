I believe it's because of the e.g. >&3 syntax, which or course means "open
descriptor 1 as a copy of descriptor 3."  >&|3, on the other hand, means
"force open a file named '3' and direct descriptors 1 and 2 there".

This could probably be fixed at the cost of making the history code do more
complex parsing ...
