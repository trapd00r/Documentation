What i meant was it's the only part of the command that may contain
unplanned -- instances. Unless you also glob somewhere else in the
command... but that seems like a bad idea?

Would this be possible?
zargs '[options]' 'command [initial-args]' [input-args]
ie the ' are literal quotes in the command so zargs knows exactly what
to do with the first two arguments (in which case you'd have to zargs
'' '' * if you wanted to omit them so maybe not aesthetically pleasing
in that regard).

Sorry, I should have looked in the manual. In my defense zargs --help
was so helpful that i didn't suspect it left anything useful out and i
did say i was tired :). Thanks for the pointers.
