Check the output of "bindkey" -- something has set up-arrow (or whatever
key you pressed) to a binding other than up-line-or-history (such as
history-beginning-search-backward).  It sounds like you may have some
global-rc-file settings affecting your shell (look for /etc/zshrc, for
instance).  There are a number of ways to fix this, including just
adding your own bindkey commands to your .zshrc:

bindkey "^P" up-line-or-history
bindkey "^[OA" up-line-or-history
