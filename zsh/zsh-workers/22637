} Ah, I guess, it's because then it should really delete the
} last value and then in this case -=a would do something non
} obvious to stay analogue to +=d.

Right.  As another example, suppose the element "a" appears more than
once in the array.  Should -= mean array[(r)a]=() or array[(R)a]=() or
array=(${array:#a}) ?

And what would array-=(e a c) mean?  Most obvious would be that it maps
the operator over the argument, I guess, but that's not the only choice.
Have you noticed that array[2]+=(x y z) splices the new elements into
the array between positions 2 and 3?  Describe array[2]-=(x y z).
