I'm running the stock zsh-3.0.4. I've noticed there have been a few
patches since it's been released, and I lost track of which ones are
"must haves". Can someone (Zoltan?) suggest a list of "blessed"
patches? Alternatively, are there plans for a 3.0.5 release (I'm not
ready to install 3.1.1 here yet).

Thanks.
