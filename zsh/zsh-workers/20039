It's easy if you impose limitations: e.g. `ulimit <number>' is treated
as setting RLIMIT_FSIZE, so you couldn't query limits like that (without an
extra option).  For example, the following (undocumented).

By the way, `ulimit -a' doesn't list the options applying to each limit
as it does in bash, so you're left guessing how to set the limit you
want.
