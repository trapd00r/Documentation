} You can use (foo **/*) &

I tend to agree with Duncan here, I'm afraid.  I may not have any idea
how large a list the glob is going to expand into; it's ridiculous to
expect me to subshell every command that might do a glob.

Furthermore, it'd be really nice to be able to stop (^Z) an unexpectedly
huge glob and then "bg" it, or to interrupt it with ^C if I decide it was
a mistake.
