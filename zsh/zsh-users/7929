I have the following zstyle in my .zshrc:

zstyle ':completion:*:(rm|cp|mv):*' ignore-line yes

Filenames with parentheses in them seem to cause problems, though. If I
have a file called for example "m(25).txt", and write the line:

% cp m(25).txt 

and then press tab after the space at the end of the line, m(25).txt is
again suggested as a completion. This does not happen with other files.

This is zsh 4.2.1 on Debian Sid.

Jesper
