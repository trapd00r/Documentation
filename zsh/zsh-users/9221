Apparently setopt magicequalsubst doesn't work by itself -- so I infer
I'm not using compinit.  How do I make sure I use it?

Also for in-line ^r, bash's behavior is quite normal -- the command
appears at the prompt.  zsh shows the pattern under the line as well.
I don't need that down-and-up, as I can see the pattern right in the
line.  Perhaps I'm overoptimistic, but if zsh is the superheroes'
shell, it should be anything bash can be and beyond!  If some people
can't remember two-three chars they just typed in, and they're in
denial of their ADHD, perhaps the pattern can be highlighted.  Same
goes for opening a bunch of stuff for completion under the line -- the
'feel' discomfort coming from bash is that you have "stuff" under the
prompt line, like a wet basement, and in bash you pretty much feel the
solid cement floor of the prompt.  It's not jerking up-and-down
suddenly.  I'm using zsh in a quake-prone area, and it shows :-)...

Cheers,
Alexy
