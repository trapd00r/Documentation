:> I've added a new autoconf test that should detect whether the ut_xtime

:Here's the definition of struct utmpx from utmpx.h on a HP-UX B.10.20
:machine (dunno if the B. is important).  There's a lot of conditional
:compilation but there's no sign of ut_time, only ut_tv; same elsewhere
:in utmpx.h. ut_time is present in struct utmp defined in utmp.h,
:however.

utmpx on:
  Digital Unix 4.0D: ut_tv.tv_sec
  Solaris 2.5: ut_xtime (is defined as ut_tv.tv_sec)
