Sorry, this is of course wrong. You just seem to have alias definition
*after* function definition. Because aliases are expanded when function
is *defined*, they are not seen when functnio is executed.

Autoloading provides neat workaround - function body is first read in
after everything else  (including aliases) was already defined. For the
same reason, second function definition in your example (on command
line) works as expected - aliases are already known.
