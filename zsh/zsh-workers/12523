} One, we could pitch out the path length test and simply let domkdir()
} fail -- and perhaps test the value of errno to decide whether to break
} or continue as a result.

Sorry, that doesn't work if the goal is that no directories in the path
get created if the whole path can't be created.  So that leaves us to
dig around for a max path length.

I suspect the True64 pathconf() is actually broken in this respect, Sven.
