} There is nothing relevant to this syntax under Subscript Flags.

Yes, there is.  The k, K, and e subscript flags all affect the
intepretation of * and @.  It's true that [(K)*] is nearly the same
as [*], but [(k)*] is quite different, as both [(k)@] and [(K)@] are
from [@].

No, this is NOT what it should say, or at least not ALL that it should
say.
