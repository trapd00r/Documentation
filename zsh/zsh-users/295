(In Zoltan's absence:)  It's not a bug, and unfortunately I think it's
going to happen a lot --- I've just had a similar experience with the
standard start-up scripts here.  This is due to the change that {, },
and [[ are treated as `reserved words' --- which basically means they
have to appear separately on the command line.  This is for
compatibility (repeat mantra 57 times :-/).

The only good side is that at least your scripts will be more
POSIX-like, even if they are zsh-specific :-/.
