Works great! thanks. This requires an extra ctrl+o later, but thats
not much of a bother..

THe thing that I really want was a quick list of files/folders of the
current directory, without having to a.lose the prompt b.type
something>shift+pageup to see past text c.I hate 'ls'
mc gives a solution, since it syncs with pwd when in 'ctrl+o' mode !!
So I can just go about my business in zsh, then perss ctrl+o to see
the files, and ctrl+o back again to zsh!
