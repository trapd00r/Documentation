Just adding some fuel: there is also still the problem that the first
undo after a completion with an automatically inserted suffix doesn't
seem to have an effect (in reality, it has: auto-removing the suffix
and undoing it back in). I once tried to fix that but failed
completely because of the rather difficult undo-recording logic.
