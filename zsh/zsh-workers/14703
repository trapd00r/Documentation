Cute technique.  But previously we have never attempted to maintain
compatibility with more than one version of autoconf; we have always had
a flag day where all developers have had to switch to the new version, and
it has never been a problem.  When dealing with packages as convoluted as
ours, such as to require a specific version of autoconf, it does not seem
too much of a burden for developers (specifically, developers that modify
the configure source) to marshall more than one version of autoconf.

I'm glad we won't need that config.status kludge any more.
