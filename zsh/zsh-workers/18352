The standard way is using the _pick_variant function.

If it's too dangerous to run the command to find out what it does, you
probably need a style.  `variant' is already use by _pick_variant,
unfortunately --- it's not a very good name, since it doesn't give the
variant, it gives the programme to run to pick the variant.  Of course
it could be set to a function that simply returns the type, but that
method doesn't have a sensible default.
