It does say the following.  Are there any flags that would get
configure to tell me more?

cc: "configure", line 9234: error 1584: Inconsistent type declaration: "gettimeofday".
cc: "configure", line 9234: error 1584: Inconsistent type declaration: "select".

I didn't see anything enlightening regarding gettimeofday, but there
is some weirdness with select where a subtly different prototype is
used in HP-UX extended via <time.h> mode in place of <sys/time.h>.

Yes, this compiles and also links with the system curses.  However,
I notice linking against ncurses still fails without the HAVE_SELECT.
Let me know if you'd like any more details on that.
