I made a test release, zsh-2.6-beta18-test1.  Beta18 is not yet ready since
the 8-bit changes are missing from zle_tricky.c.  Without these changes,
completion is unusable.  To make completion work on lines which does not
contain any special characters I made get_comp_string and doexpandhist()
8-bit clean.  Az a side effect line is null terminated after these
functions which makes completion usable on normal lines.

I renamed the `mult' zle variable (which contains the numeric argument of
zle commands) to zmult since someone reported that some Solaris 2.5 shared
elf library uses an extern mult function.

I removed STOUCP and UTOSCP macros.  If someone has old patches he may use

sed -e 's/\(\W\)\(mult\W\)/\1z\2/g' -e 's/UTOSCP(\([^)]*\))/(char *) \1/g'

on them before applying (that can produce wrong output but on the zsh
source it works).

The test release is only available as a patch to beta17 and it can be found
on ftp://ftp.cs.elte.hu/pub/zsh/testing/zsh-2.6-beta18-test1.diff.gz

The file is in an executable-only directory.

The size of the file is 47370 bytes, the md5 checksum is

d4a30880fe0d74c6cd47d6e1fbe9c489

For the full list of changes, see the ChangeLog.

I did not add the WORDCHARS2 patch since I think that zsh has enough
kill-word & co. related features.

Zoltan
