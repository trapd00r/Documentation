Subject: Equivalent of compctl -L with "new" completion system?
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1; format=flowed
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Content-Disposition: inline

Is there a command or function that will (a) list all commands that
have custom (zshcompsys) completions and indicate what they are, and
(b) do the same, but only for a given command, like

(a)  compctl -L
and
(b)  compctl -L svn

do for the old compctl-style completions?
