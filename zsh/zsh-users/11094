Hi,

Apologies for the somewhat ambiguous title, but this is quite hard to=20
succinctly describe.  Let's say that I have a variable that contains the=20
string
   export FOO=3Dfoo
How do I get that to actually export the variable?

In other words, why does the following script, when run, not set the=20
environment variable?

   % cat ./test
   #!/usr/bin/env

   FOO=3D"export BAR=3Dbar"
   `${FOO}`
   % ./test
   ./test:1: command not found: export BAR=3Dbar

I have a suspicion that this has got something to do with forking and the=
=20
environment within which the command is run.

Thanks in advance for any pointers.

Regards,
Andrew Ho
