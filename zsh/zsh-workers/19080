    Hi all :))

    With your invaluable help I have written an small 'pidof' clone,
that currently just writes to stdout all PID's whose command name
matches $1. I'm not sure if it behaves like the original pidof, but I
just want it to tell me the PID's of some command: it is more a Zsh
exercice than a serious attempt at writing a pidof clone.

    Feel free to make suggestions, corrections, bug reports, etc...
so that the script can be shorter, faster, etc...

    Thanks a lot again for your help. I'm learning Zsh and I love
more than before, if possible ;)) Here comes the script:
---
#!/bin/zsh
for process in /proc/<->
do
    name="${${(ps:\000:)$(<$process/cmdline)}[1]}"
    [[ -z $name ]] && name="${${(f)$(<$process/status)%%State*}[1]#*[[:space:]]}"
    [[ -z ${(M)name:#*"$1"*} ]] || print -n $process(:t) ""
done

# The following is just for testing ;)))
print
