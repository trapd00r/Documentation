As we've had various fairly visible fixes and little new code since
4.3.5, I've uploaded

ftp://ftp.zsh.org/pub/development/zsh-4.3.5-dev-1.tar.gz

and variants in the hope of releasing a bug-fix-only 4.3.6 quite soon.
This just missed the zkbd fix (despite the CVS tag), however there will
no doubt be other versions.

I will be away for most of the next week and a half, although probably
around intermittently till Tuesday, after which you'll have to fix your
own bugs.
