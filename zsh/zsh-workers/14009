Good, I think you can commit it.

I think it's a typo.  And I couldn't find the message that added it in
the archive, searching for `compstate\[quote\]'.  That test once was
`-z $compstate[quote]', too, which wasn't right either.

It should test $compstate[quote] != \', because $s aren't expanded
inside single quotes (try it with completion after

  foo=bar
  echo '$foo/<TAB>

where there exists a directory named `$foo').

Yes, that would be better.  I might have a look once your patch is
committed, don't have the time now.
