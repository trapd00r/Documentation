I'm a bit confused by both of the both comments. Firstly, %j works "as a
user would expect" for me in zsh v4.1.1 (i.e. I get the behaviour that
Felix expects). Secondly, %t, %@, %T, %*, %? (etc.) work as expected in
PS1, so why should we not expect %j to work? Thirdly, Felix demonstrated
that %j could could /up/ (i.e. the prompt *did* get updated between
interactive commands) and he was questioning why it didn't also count
/down/.
