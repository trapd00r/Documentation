Hi Peter,

I've always known it to behave like that, I even thought it was
documented but I can't find it now in the manual so maybe it
wasn't.

I've myself already relied on it before, though many other
times, it's true I have wished it was not removing empty items.

${(f)var}

strips the empty lines.

If you want to retain empty items, you can always use IFS.
