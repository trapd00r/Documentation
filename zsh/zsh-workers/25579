I must admit that I can see that the zsh web pages aren't the clearest
with respect to downloading. I've always thought the Contents link was a
bit pointless and I long ago stopped putting the md5sums into the
content of the page.

dotsrc.org seems a bit slow at the moment and the recent news item that
I added took a while to filter through (though I did manage to rsync it
to sourceforge earlier).

Mirmon looks very nice but where could we host it? I think it would be
better to use that for tracking mirrors and make zsh.org just another
mirror of the main zsh web page content (though it might be the master).

Is there anyone with more web skills than me that could come up with a
new design for the zsh web pages. It'd only need to be something a bit
clearer and more modern and simple enough underneath that adding news
items would be easy. Or do people think we should go another route such
as making zshwiki.org the official site?

Oliver
