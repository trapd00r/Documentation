That wasn't the issue: we should certainly distribute our own, otherwise
there's little point in the new module since an administrator can do
everything with the existing global startup files.  The point was that
our defaults would go in a version-specific location, but if an
administrator wanted to override it it's easier to use a fixed location,
so it should search there first.

Things like autocd are suitable for this.  It should probably also turn
on completion.  It would be wrong to do very much; for example it
probably ought not to define aliases, certainly not replacements for
common commands which can be both infuriating and dangerous.
