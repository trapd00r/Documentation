This used to work.  Has it officially stopped?  MH folder completion
currently won't work because of it.  That can be trivially changed if the
new behaviour is correct.

foopath=~/Mail
compdef _foo foo
foo() { _path_files -W foopath -/ }
foo <TAB>

used to expand $foopath and complete directories, now doesn't.
