Thanx for both replies, it would seem my requirement has crossed the invisible shell/application
boundary.I realise now that shells don't have a database I hoped there might be a real simple

I did have a phase of writing all my "scripts" in Perl, but noticed that they were much slower than
their equivalent shell scripts.
