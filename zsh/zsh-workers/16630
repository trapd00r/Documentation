FWIW, I'd be willing to host zsh on sources.redhat.com.  As one of the
site administrators, I can provide web space, ftp space, cvs access, and
mailing lists.

I can also redirect zsh.org to sources.redhat.com, if required.

It would be a privilege to be able to be able provide some service in
exchange for all of the happy years that I've been using zsh.

FWIW, we don't have anything like the privacy policy that you mention able
and I don't anticipate that we ever will.  I can't make any guarantees,
of course, but I'd be pretty surprised if anything like that came
to pass.
