} So, do I understand correctly that changing (r) to behave as I'd like
} could be rather difficult for the expected benefits (especially as
} there is the (q) workaround (at least for arrays at the moment))?

Yes, you understand correctly.

And I later discovered (in the course of fixing it) that the problem with
$scalar[(r)${(q)pattern}] occurs only if $pattern ends with a `*'.

} ${param#foo*$bar} treating the $bar differently than
} ${param[(r)foo*$bar]} is rather surprising for the casual user

If that's the only thing about zsh that surprises a casual user, we're in
better shape than I thought. :-)
