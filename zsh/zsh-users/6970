Is it really a bug? Doesn't ksh offer this as the preferred behaviour by
default in the absence of the 'posix' option? But it seems like an
oversight that zsh doesn't give you the ability to have the POSIX
behaviour. Perhaps this is one of the featurebugs that makes zsh
unsuitable as /bin/sh. Some zsh scripts might depend on zsh's current
behaviour.
