} It doesn't anymore, (e) is silent nowadays. By using eval we could get 
} that, though (that's why I said `careful').

Something like this:

	eval exp\=\( ${${(q)exp}:gs/\\{/{/:gs/\\}/}/} \)

I haven't figured out where the right place to put that is, though.  I
tried a couple of different spots in _expand and they both caused brace
*completion* to stop working, even though the word on the line didn't
change.
