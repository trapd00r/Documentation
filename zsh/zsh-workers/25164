} Yes.

OK, then what do each of the following mean, and how could I figure it
out from the documentation?

  m:{[:lower:][:digit:]}={[:upper:][:digit:]}
  m:{[:digit:][:lower:]}={[:upper:][:digit:]}
  m:{[:lower:]0-9}={[:upper:][:digit:]}
  m:{[:lower:][:digit:]}={[:alnum:]}
  m:{[:lower:]}={[:alpha:]}

} I missed a special case, in fact: if the classes are the same,
} then the character is forced to be the same as well.

So m:{[:alnum:]}={[:alnum:]} is effectively an expensive no-op?

Found another doc typo, by the way:

< item(tt([:lower:]))(l
