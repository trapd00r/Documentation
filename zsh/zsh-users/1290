This is roughly what I use but the annoying thing is that it only works
properly for the first level of directories:

from my home:

cd [tab]
-- all non directories listed - good.
cd .[tab]
-- all hidden directories listed
cd .netscape/[tab]
-- all of the *files* and directories in my .netscape directory listed.

This is one of the main things I miss from tcsh. I'm hoping those recent
patches have sorted this one out but I haven't yet compiled that version
of zsh.
