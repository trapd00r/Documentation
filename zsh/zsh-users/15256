When I last proposed making 'set +o nomatch' the default, like it is in
Bourne shell, Ksh, and Bash, I got similar feedback - that it is dangerous
because sometimes the wildcards do expand something, and sometimes they don't,
etc. But has this ever actually caused problems for anybody? For me, it simply
"does the right thing" most (if not all) of the time. The "nomatch" error
always reminds of those "you forgot a semicolon at the end of the line"
compilation errors in C - if you know I forgot something, why not help me
and fix it for me? :-)

And considering that people coming from other shells (not including csh,
which I wonder who continues to use) assume this feature, I still wonder
why it's not the default in zsh.
