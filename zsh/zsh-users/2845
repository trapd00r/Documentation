Hi,

I'm trying to get ZSH (3.0.5) to list matches to command-line
completion on the *first* TAB press & then cycle thru them on
successive (*second*, third onwards) presses. However, it lists
matches *&* starts cycling on the first press.

I thought I just had to setopt autolist & menucomplete but
it appears I have to do more than this.

Anyone?

SCoTT! :)
