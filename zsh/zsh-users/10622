} How can I have both?

As far as I can tell, you can't.  The test for whether to print that
prompt or invoke scrolling is deep in the C code after the shell
functions have given up control.  You can hook in at the comppostfuncs
to ask the question yourself, but at that point it appears to be too
late to prevent the list from being printed anyway.
