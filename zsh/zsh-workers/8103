Forgive me now for this horrible thought.

I'm at that point in my life where I need a shell that fills in the
completion automagically and changes it as necessary the more I type
(just like that horrible feature that MS products tend to have). I'm
crazy, I admit it. To make life easier in the future, I'm planning on
putting potential completions into a list or array (of the zsh variety).

Before I begin the nastiness, has someone already done this? (Aside from
the Reactive Keyboard from U of Calgary, which does all sorts of nasty
termio stuff in a way that was current 9 years ago and doesn't like
to compile on newer OS's) And any hints as to where to start inserting
stupid hacks?

Thanks,
Ben

There are two ways to write error-free programs; only the third one works.
