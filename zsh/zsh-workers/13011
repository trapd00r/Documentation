I could finally run (almost) all Zsh tests under lasy Cygwin snapshot.
Unfortunately, doing it I found, that reading from pty currently takes about
98% CPU time :-( (I wonder, why we do not notice it on Unix). That is well
seen running completion tests.

Peter, you that select does not work under Cygwin (read_poll). I asked on
Cygwin list, but there are no known problems and many applications do use
select.

What specific problems did you have?
