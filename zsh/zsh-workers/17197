How about max-matches-width? Or maybe max-width-matches.

It would be better.

Another possibility would be to vary the position of the description
from one line to the next which would be good in situations such as
where only a couple out of many options have multiple options for the
same description.

Handling of empty descriptions is perhaps not ideal. I'm getting
lines like:
% info -d ~/info zsh <tab>
menu item
Arithmetic Evaluation     --
Command Execution         --
