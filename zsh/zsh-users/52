The following code does not behave as one would normally expect:

        while vared -c -p 'zsql> ' sql
        do
           print -s $sql
	   echo "your input was = $sql"
	   unset sql
	done

It seems that 'vared' never sees the most recent event in the
history list, i.e. you have to enter a dummy line before you can
edit the one you just entered. (to see what I'm talking about, run
the above, input anything, then up-arrow/enter, then up-arrow/enter
again).

Is this a bug, or a configuration option?

thanks,
