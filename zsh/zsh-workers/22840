My experiences with SVN have so far been nothing but frustrating.  This
may just be due to stupidity on the part of the people operating the
repository I've been trying to use, but operations I do routinely in
CVS (such as having multiple sandboxes with a different branch in each,
or checking out a single subdirectory on a different branch than the
rest of the modules, or even just checking out a single subdirectory
or a single *file* without *getting* the rest of the modules) seem to
be extremely hard to accomplish in SVN.
