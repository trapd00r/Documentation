The only pieces I'd really like fixed are to finish completion matching
with multibyte characters, which is half implemented (the remaining
somewhat messy code is heavily optimised for the case of single-byte
characters), and also to fix the case of completion with commands inside
nested quotes (for example, in sh -c '...'), which is quite badly broken
as soon as you try anything other than the most basic cases.  However,
in practice people don't encounter the problems with nested quotes much,
it's been like that for a long while, and it's not specific to multibyte
support which is the big feature of 4.3, so I'd be happy with getting
completion matching finished.

As widely reported, there are virtually no volunteers for anything in
the C code.
