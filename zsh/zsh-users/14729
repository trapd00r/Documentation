Er, well, yes, that output is what was important.

Try running

    zsh -v 2>zsh.out

and then simply exit the shell and look at the zsh.out file with a pager
or text editor.  Read through it looking for things that you don't
understand.  Compare what you see to what's in the files you know
about.  If your .zlogin is really the only other init file and moving
away .zshrc doesn't change anything, then the ~/.keychain/$HOST-sh file
must be where the problem lies.
