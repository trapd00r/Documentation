I made P:: a separate thing so it doesn't complete command names, and
managed to figure out a way to make oe and o+ complete commands too.
I'm not sure if it's the best way, or even a good way, basically I was
just throwing stuff at it until it worked. I also removed all the
tabs, if you don't want that, the first two changes are available
separately here:
