If the partition that /usr is mounted [assuming its different from /] on goes down can a usr still boot up to fix things if his logon shell is zsh.

For example on Solaris, bash, has components in /usr and if that partition goes down one can't log in again to fix things.  

So is there enough crictical zsh code in the root partition say /bin to run zsh as a standalone shell without accessing dlls or whatever in a /usr partition?
