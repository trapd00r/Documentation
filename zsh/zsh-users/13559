Hence you think [[ -t 0 ]] < "$1" is going to cause a problem because
it opens and closes the device.

If that's so, you do this:

  exec {ttyfd}<>"$1"
  [[ -t $ttyfd ]]

Now $ttyfd remains open for read and write, and future redirections
can use it, e.g.

    print -u $ttyfd "This is $1"
    cat < /etc/termcap >&$ttyfd

I'm not sure of the context, so somehow you have to get $ttyfd to be
visible both where you're testing the tty-ness of $1 and wherever it
is you wanted to use $1 for I/O.
