} This should really go into the FAQ :-) (I asked it a few weeks ago).

If it does go in the FAQ, it should include a note that RPROMPT (RPS1)
does not work correctly unless PROMPT (PS1) starts at far left.  Thus
if you use RPS1, you either need setopt promptcr, or you need a newline
in PS1 somewhere.
