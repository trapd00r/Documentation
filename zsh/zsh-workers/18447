Subject: Segmentation fault caused by completion system
Message-ID: <20030417160234.GA4940@s>

"*" in front of "-+" or "+-" in the optspecs to "_arguments"
causes a segmentation fault on completion.  Here's an example:

  #compdef foo
  _arguments '*-+bar'

Now try using it:

  % foo <TAB>
  foo zsh: segmentation fault (core dumped)  zsh

System info:

  zsh 4.0.6 (i386-slackware-linux-gnu)
  Slackware 9.0 (gcc 3.2.2, termcap 2.0.8, libc 2.3.1)
