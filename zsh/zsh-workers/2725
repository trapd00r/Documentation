That's odd.  It looks like history-search-{for,back}ward only behaved
as documented if the word ended in a space, otherwise acting like
history-beginning-search-{for,back}ward.  Wouldn't it be better to make
them actually behave as documented -- only look for complete words
matching the current one?
