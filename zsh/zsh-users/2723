It's now in the `compwid' part of the docs (even with this example;
see? sometimes I *can* imagine what people would like to know ;-)...

If your zsh is at least approximately up-to-date, you should use:

  compmatchers=('m:{a-z}={A-Z}')

to get the one-way case-insensitiveness everywhere, or

  compmatchers=('m:{a-zA-Z}={A-Za-z}')

for both ways. If that doesn't work for you, you have to use `compctl -M'
with those strings as arguments.


Bye
 Sven
