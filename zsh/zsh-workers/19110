That's not entirely true.  A brief and thorougly unscientific
investigation suggests man is doing popen() or something equivalent.
That means that if you set

typeset -ax PAGER
PAGER=(/bin/view -)

and zsh exported PAGER as the string "/bin/view -", it would work
because the shell used to invoked the pager would do the splitting.
(What I actually died was confirm that
  export PAGER="less -e"
did the right thing.)

It shouldn't be too hard to make arrays get exported joined with a
space, or maybe even a configurable string (though the param structure
isn't conveniently extensible at the moment).  I think that's far more
useful than the ksh behaviour --- probably that's just a side effect of
the fact that all variables in ksh are arrays but most just have the first
element set.  However, I haven't looked into it.
