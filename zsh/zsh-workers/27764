If you're doing *anything* to the linked list code, the first imperative
is documenting what it currently does.  I'm not interested in improving
it until it's clearly written in <your foreground colour> and <your
background colour> what it is that's being improved.

To get on my high horse, in fact the first and last imperative with lots
of the code is better documentation.  I have wasted days of my life
having to puzzle things out.
