Understood.  When I first introduced my patch a while back, this came
up.  I asked RMS about it, and he seemed willing to grant an exception
for the small amount of GNU code I was using, but then the discussion
closed to between RMS and some zsh maintainer (I don't remember who, but 
my guess is it was someone still on the list).

I'll ask Richard again if the issue wasn't resolved 2 years ago --
coincidentally, I was just demoing my Scwm (scheme constraints window
manager) to him on Wednesday while he was down here visiting Melbourne, Australia.
