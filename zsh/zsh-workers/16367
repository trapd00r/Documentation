Discovered today that redhat's initscripts try to execute roughly:

	$SHELL -c kill -SIGIO $PID

which works if root's shell is bash, the util-linux kill command also
accepts -SIG<SIG> args, however, zsh's kill builtin doesn't accept this.
it seems like a perfectly simple patch to do, and i'd probably do it myself
if it weren't for being behind a 14.4 cellular link at the moment (it was the
ppp-watch stuff in redhat's initscripts which tried to do that ;)
