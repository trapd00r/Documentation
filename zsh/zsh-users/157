Good luck!

As an mh user and a zsh user, I have had this same problem.
You cannot get zsh to work with mh without extreme kludginess. What I
do is have my mail initially filtered into standard mailboxes, so that
zsh and xbuffy will work. Than I use a short script when I want to inc
the files into the appropriate folders. A bit hackish, but it works.

This has really annoyed the hell out of me, but I guess it would be a
bit unfair to insist on zsh conforming to mh's non-standard
mechanisms. (but it would be a nice option)
