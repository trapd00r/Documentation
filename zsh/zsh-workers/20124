Hi,

With zsh 4.2.0:

greux:~> zsh -f
greux% setopt nohup
greux% coproc while true; do :; done
[1] 21580
greux% [Ctrl-d]
zsh: you have running jobs.
greux% [Ctrl-d]
greux:~>

but the coprocess hasn't be killed. IMHO, this is a bug, as the
coprocess is a special background process, which has no reasons
to run without its parent.

(I'm not subscribed to zsh-workers, but the Mail-Followup-To should
be correctly set.)

Regards,
