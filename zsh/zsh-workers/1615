} zle doen not handle the case when a line does not fit onto the screen.

Well, I know it doesn't handle it the way it does when a line does fit,
but it's obviously trying to do *something*.

} Geoff told me that for some reason zsh have to know in advance wether the

} after the last column.

Right; if zsh doesn't know about autowrap, and tries to print a newline
after the $COLUMNS'th character, you could end up with blank lines between
each two displayed lines.

But if zsh knows enough to avoid printing the newline because the terminal
autowraps, then it also ought to be able to avoid this.

Just mention it in etc/BUGS if nobody knows how to fix it ...
