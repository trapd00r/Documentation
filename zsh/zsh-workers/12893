I stumbled over this, too, when reading the manual while I was away.

I don't see a way to implement such a behaviour (i.e. I'm pretty sure
it isn't possible currently). So, Bart's changes, both in the docs and 
in _expand(|_word) are fine.

But of course I may start to think if this could be implemented -- if
I find a not-too-complicated way for changing the C-code...

Bye
 Sven
