I don't know why shell writers insist on using several init files.
The .login/.zshprofile/.zshlogin file isn't sourced every time you'd need it
(typically, it's not sourced from an XDM login), so you need to move stuff from
there into zshenv.

On another hand, a variable indicating whether the shell is a login shell is
necessary (and sadly missing from tcsh).
