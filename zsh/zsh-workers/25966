I couldn't see a problem with Solaris 8 and gcc, which is what I've got.

It would be useful to know if it showed up in non-file completions such as

_tst() {
  compadd -M 'm:{a-z}={A-Z}' -- \
  PacketDefinitionSAXHandler.h PacketListBox.cpp \
  PacketListBox.h PacketsDialog.h;
}

since the code to add matchers for file completion is separate and I've
changed it recently.
