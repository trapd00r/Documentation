this moves all files containig 'somestring' in it's filename, not in the
file itself, as I understood it and as it would in the former command.

But you are right, the find expressens prerequisite would be that it is
 not allowd to have 2 or more files matching the grep with the same name
in different directories in '.'. Otherwise you would sould only find a
subset of files in tmp

And tmp should not be a subdirectory of the directory you are searching
in it would break with an error for moving the same file to itself
