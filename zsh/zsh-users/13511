Hi folks,

I recently discovered edit-command-line[0] and that made me think
that zsh should really get a feature which would allow the user to
use an editor to feed data to a command's stdin, basically
a simplified here-document, e.g. with a syntax mockup:

   # opens editor on tmpfile, feeds file to wc stdin on close
~$ wc <<!

   # puts cat output into tmpfile, opens editor, feeds tmpfile to wc
   # on close
~$ cat |! wc

What do people think about this feature? Is it feasible?
