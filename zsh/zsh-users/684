OK, I did that.

Did that too..

That's defined in my .Xresources

If I 'chsh' to bash, 8 bit characters work fine even without doing any
of the above... I'm a bit lost on that one. Now I remember that at some
point they worked when I had compiled and installed zsh myself, and they
stoped working since I switched to the Debian zsh package.

Anyway thanks a lot for your help, I'll keep trying but really don't
understand what's going on, especially with bash working and zsh not.

Merci.
