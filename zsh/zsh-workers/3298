Sorry? What about LANG and LC_CTYPE? They existed long ago.

I don't know, which OS is in use; but check your LANG/LC_CTYPE/LC_ALL
settings - they should be appropriate for French locale. If it doesn't
help, it your OS (probably, implementation of ctype functions or
setlocale()) that is broken. 

BTW it is documeneted in zshparam(1) - at least for 3.0.4 and 3.1.2.
