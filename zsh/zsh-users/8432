Looks like this is is a change in Cygwin.  It doesn't happen on my setup
which is several months old and the test in zsh hasn't changed for a
long time.

I think Peter Castro is going to be looking at problems with 4.2.3 at
the Cygwin end.  Meanwhile, if FIFOs are the problem it should be
possible to doctor the script to tell them they don't work under
Cygwin.
