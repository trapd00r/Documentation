I've always put all my environment stuff in ~/.zshenv.  Lately, however,
I've come to realize that that may not be such a good idea.  I mean, the
environment is passed down as it is, why tell shells the same
information again?  The problem really is that if you put, for example,
your PATH definition in ~/.zshenv, and have a script or application that
modifies PATH and later runs a shell, that shell will not use the
specifically crafted PATH, but will read the standard one from
~/.zshenv.  An example would be procmail with ~/.procmailrc.  I have the
lines:
	PATH="/usr/bin:/bin"
	SHELL="/bin/zsh"
in my ~/.procmailrc.  I recently realized that, as I had set the shell
for procmail to invoke sub-processes with to Zsh, that the PATH setting
had no effect.  This was rather bad, as I was doing some echo debugging
in my ~/.zshenv and a lot of mails got messed up in the process.  So,
anyway, is there _any_ reason to put stuff in ~/.zshenv, and, if so,
what?
