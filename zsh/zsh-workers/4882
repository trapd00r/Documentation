How many current patches are there against 3.0.5?

Bart refered in one article to 3.0.5-extended -- is that local to you
Bart?  A search on the web-site archives turns up nothing.

I'm thinking of creating a megapatch.  The list I currently have is:
 Archive#   Details
 3548(1997) Zoltan - rcexpandparam
 1880       Bart - handling EINTR with command substitutions
 4644       Bart - arithmetic expressions
 4870       Goran Larsson - Y2k
 3809       Bart (3.0.5 adapt of PWS 3.1.x patch) - Glob qualifier close
 4447       Bart - (believe sigwinch)

I know that this last patch might be objected to - I'd go on opinion
here.  Or am I just duplicating what someone else has already done?
 
Thanks
