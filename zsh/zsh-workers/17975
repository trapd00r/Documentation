    Hi all :))

    A week ago someone asked how to perform filename completion after
an equal sign. Well, this is achieved through the shell option
MAGIC_EQUAL_SUBST.

    I tested that same day and it worked, but no... it doesn't work
anymore! Any idea of what may have I screwed for this stop working?

    My loaded modules are:
    zsh/compctl
    zsh/complete
    zsh/complist
    zsh/main
    zsh/zle
    zsh/stat

    just in case it matters (a time ago one problem I had with
completion had to do with modules...).

    If the output of 'setopt' is needed, just tell.

    Thanks in advance :)
    Raúl
