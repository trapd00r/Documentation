This only works with bash 1.x.  bash 2.0 will properly choke in the same way
as zsh.

Better to fix the bug in Netscape (and harass them about fixing it)

This is a slightly modified excerpt of the Debian netscape installer script
(for perl)

undef $/;
open(NETSCAPE,"</tmp/netscape.orig") || die "ERROR: Could not read netscape exec
utable -- $!\n";
$netscape = <NETSCAPE>;
close(NETSCAPE);

$netscape =~ s/\(\(\0cat %s \| \0\);/\( \0cat %s \| \0 ;/;

$outfile='/tmp/netscape.patched';
open(NETSCAPE,">$outfile") || die "ERROR: Could not write '$outfile' -- $!\n";
print NETSCAPE $netscape;
close(NETSCAPE);
chmod 0755,$outfile;
