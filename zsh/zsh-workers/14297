This tends to be where the problems start.  Things that destabilise
releases in the past have tended to be fixes for serious bugs, such as not
even compiling on some well-known target.  In practice that means simply
deciding patch by patch.

We've been (supposedly) scaling down development for some time.

This is all sensible.

That's fine.  It's been almost a year since the last full release anyway,
and goodness knows how long since the first 3.0.

In particular tests for options and builtins are missing.

This just means anybody who has such tools running them.  This is always
encouraged.
