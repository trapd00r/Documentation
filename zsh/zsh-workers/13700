I'd throw a "cvs update" in there before the "cvs tag", just in case.

Otherwise this looks good.

Here are my suggestions for renaming in the Functions subdirectory.  I've
left in Functions/Misc anything that it seemed likely one might want to
have in one's "standard" fpath, relocated stuff related to old compctl
completions into Functions/Compctl, and stashed everything else in
Functions/Examples.  A few of those latter might possibly want to be
in Misc instead; I've marked those.

And of course we could then rename the entire Misc directory to something
less vague, but I didn't put any thought into that yet.

Functions/Misc/acx		Functions/Examples	# Misc?
Functions/Misc/allopt		Functions/Misc
Functions/Misc/cat		Functions/Examples
Functions/Misc/cdmatch		Functions/Compctl
Functions/Misc/cdmatch2		Functions/Compctl
