It's not in my 2.0.2, either. I had to extract the patch to go from
2.0.2 to 2.0.3 with a MIME extraction tool I've never used
before, and it was late at night. Apparently I screwed up. My
apologies. 

Anyway, I went back and re-did it (to get to 2.0.4) and these
particular problems are fixed now:

            $ grep defauly *.html
            $ grep anexternal *.html

Maybe the coffee helps ;-). The latest version (2.0.4) is now up at

	http://www.mal.com/zsh/Doc/test/

where zsh.texi.gz is version 2.03.

Ditto.

Nuts. I'd heard that texi2html did a very good job with the
conversion. But apparently it has flaws, too. I'll try to look over
the texi2html source and see what can be done.

Thanks, I've done that with this version.
