I've finally figured out what this is:  The BAUD parameter was set in my
4.1.0-dev shells but unset in 4.0.1.  This probably has to do with how I
started up the shells (4.0.1 is installed, 4.1.0-dev I'm running out of a
build tree, and I have conditional code to `unset BAUD' in startup files).
However:

This is at least a bug in the documentation.  BAUD is listed as a parameter
used by the shell, not one set by the shell, and I'm not assigning to it.

Looking at Src/params.c, I see BAUD gets set when HAVE_SELECT is defined.
Nowadays this is probably the case more often than it is not.

Would anyone object to moving the BAUD doc into the "set by" section?  It
probably ought to get at least a cross-reference somewhere in the ZLE
section as well.
