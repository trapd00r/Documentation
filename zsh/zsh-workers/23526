That should be enough to help _pick_variant.  I've tried two versions of
the GNU version:

STDOUT:units version 1.80 with readline, units database in /usr/share/units.dat

STDOUT:GNU Units version 1.85
STDOUT:without readline, units database in /usr/share/units.dat
STDOUT:Copyright (C) 2004 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
STDOUT:GNU Units comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY.
STDOUT:You may redistribute copies of GNU Units
STDOUT:under the terms of the GNU General Public License.
STDOUT:

(the units database output is also useful).  Solaris just dumps its
database and prints out the "you have: " prompt, which is ignored
since _pick_variant redirects input from /dev/null.
