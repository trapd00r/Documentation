there are a heck of a lot of ${...} modifiers that are wonderfully useful,
but in my searching through the man pages, I havn't found an equivelent to
basename /usr/local/bin/mumble -> mumble.  I need to pull the basename out
of path strings quite offten, and I'd like to do so in shell.

Is this ... (wait, this is zsh) How can I do this?
