You should only need the three tags used by _files and the `files' tag 
that might be used if _path_files is called by a function that doesn't 
use its own tag. So:

  zstyle ':completion:*:(directories|(globbed-|all-|files))' matcher ...

plus all the file-patterns tags and labels you defined yourself.

I know that this is a bit ugly, if I could see a better way, I would
have done that some time ago, but...
