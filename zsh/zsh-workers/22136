Okay.  Got that to work on Linux, then, over an ssh connection to work, it
worked just fine on my Solaris box (again, that's with the patch in 22124).
It'll probably have to wait until Monday until I can get in to work and try
it at the console (and see if I can't make use of that compose key I have).
