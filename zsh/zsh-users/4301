	zsh spawns a subshell for the LHS of a pipe, rather than
the RHS, which lets you do things like=20

$ do_something | read VAR

	and have VAR still be set.  That means that jobs in your
example is being run in a subshell where there _aren't_ any background
jobs.  The only way I can think of offhand to get the info from jobs
would be to redirect the output of jobs to a temp file and then use that
to build your prompt; that's not very efficient, however.  I don't know
if there's some other way to get that info from the shell.
