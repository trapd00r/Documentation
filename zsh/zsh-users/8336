I'm personally content with a different colored prompt for remote 
machines.  This is taken care of in my .zshrc file with something like 
this pseudo code:

case ${HOST} in
   (host1) PS1=<substitute your favorite prompt here> ;;
   (host2) PS1=<different colored prompt here> ;;
esac

I don't want to take the focus of this discussion off of zsh, but if 
you're using OS X and Terminal, you can set up a Terminal window to 
have the characteristics that you like (i.e. color of background), then 
save it as a .term file which you launch only when you want to ssh to a 
particular host.  You can even set it so that just by launching a 
particular .term file, the ssh command will be carried out for you.

Hope this helps.
