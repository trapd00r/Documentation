Hi,

Is it possible to bind an INS key to accept-and-menu-complete?
All my attempts like
bindkey -M menuselect "${key[Insert]}" accept-and-menu-complete
doesn't work, pressing Insert just prints a "~".

Also, is it possible to bind a couple of commands to the same key, like
bindkey "^Z" "kill-line; accept-line"?

thanks
