Subject: RegEx glob mode?
Date: Thu, 18 Mar 1999 20:48:38 -0600
From: "E. Larry Lidz" <ellidz@eridu.uchicago.edu>


Something that I'd love to see in a shell is a mode to replace normal
globbing with regex matching. So that things like:

ls (foo|bar)?baz.*

would work.

I'm sure it'd confuse a lot of people (why doesn't ls foo* match foobaz?)
but as an option, I think it'd be extremely popular, particularly for
certain shell scripts...

[cc me with discussion? I'm not on the list.]
