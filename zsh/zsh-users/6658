Subject: startup delay from compinit

Hi,

I'd like to start using the "new" completion system, but
running compinit from .zshrc seems to take about two seconds,
which is frustrating since otherwise a new xterm takes only
a few tens of milliseconds to be ready to use. (For ref,
I'm using a 750Mhz Solaris sparcv9 machine). 

I believe I've followed the instructions in zshcompsys, and
have .zcompdump being created, and so on.  So am I doing something
wrong, or is this time overhead to be expected?  If so, is
there any alternative way to load all the completion functions
lazily?

Regards

Anthony
