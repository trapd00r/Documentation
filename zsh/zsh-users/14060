Hi,

I'm trying to use the Zsh helpfiles utility to generate files for "run-
help".

I'm running

man zshbuiltins | col -bx | perl /usr/share/zsh/4.3.9/Util/helpfiles
    or
man zshbuiltins | colcrt - | perl /usr/share/zsh/4.3.9/Util/helpfiles

on a Gentoo Linux with Perl 5.8.8 and Zsh 4.3.9. The commands don't 
error but I receive no output at all.

On a Cygwin system with Perl 5.10 the help files are generated just 
fine.

Any way to debug that?


Thorsten
