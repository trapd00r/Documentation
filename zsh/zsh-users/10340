Hi Bart,

Thanks for answer.

hope it will come soon.

i know the difficulty of that and thought that long time zsh scripters
had already shared their tips.

thinking about it, i've decided to mix both : "private" functions will
be prefixed by z__ and local vars will be prefixed by the name of their
function.

For exemple:
function z__association_compare
variable z__association_compare_current_key=20

Thanks for clues and regards,
mc
