Any idea what causes the following?


$ ls -al ~men/.cshrc
-rw-r--r--   1 men 1300 Thu Sep 30 16:51:48 1993 /cray3/men/.cshrc
$ ls -al ~men/xemacs
zsh: Does ~men/xemacs mean /cray3/men/xemacs [nyae]? n
lrwxrwxrwx   1 men 33 Fri Sep  1 16:09:02 1995 /cray3/men/xemacs -> /cray2/mdb/share/bin/xemacs-19.13

i.e., why does zsh prompt for a spelling correction on the 2nd one and
not the 1st? (~men is /cray3/men)

I think the 1st is more desirable, but I'm more puzzled by the
inconsistency.
