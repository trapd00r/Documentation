grrr... I'm telling me... EPOCHSECONDS didn't have an unsetfn, so still
crashed when the module was unloaded.  Should we guard against this?
It's odd that readonly variables need an unsetfn (though I think it's
reasonable that you need to explicitly remove the readonly flag when
unsetting).

Committed with that change.
