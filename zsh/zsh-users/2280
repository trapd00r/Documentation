Ah, yes... now this makes much more sense to me.  Though why can't
executing a setopt load a module (as invoking a function loads that
function)?  Similarly, I've wanted this for completion controls, too --
scanning all my completion stuff takes forever at startup-- it'd be nice 
to have them autoloaded when I first try to complete (ignorance warning: 
I've not been following the 3.1.x discussion on completion stuff so
maybe people are working on this or something similar).

This seems reasonable, and I'd be glad to make the colorized completion
stuff work as you suggest so as to not burden the 3.1 implementation
unnecessarily.

Thanks for your clarification.
