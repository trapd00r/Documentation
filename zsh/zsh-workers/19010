    That's the point, I don't have those binaries (it's a long story)
and I would prefer not to install them if I can avoid it (and seems
like I can avoid it...). Moreover, there are *two* killall binaries
lurking around in Linux. One of them does what its name suggests, and
kills all running processes (well, more or less...). The other one
kills a process by name, not by PID.
