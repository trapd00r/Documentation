About the only game in town is the head of the main branch at sourceforge
(http://sourceforge.net/projects/zsh/).

I think the way to start is to integrate any #ifdef's into the source and
send diffs (or pointers to diffs if they're long) to the list for
committing to the archive---not sure if you have separate source files for
Symbian support but we can add those, too.  To begin with you might want to
keep your own build system and we can integrate that once the code is
basically merged.
