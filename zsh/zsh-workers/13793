I'd agree that this is something which would be nice to clean up. I'd
have thought that it would be fine to use env for these. I've not
really seen a system on which it won't work and they are mostly
examples or functions so people can always fix the line. I would
suggest though putting a #! on the second line, possibly with a comment
so it is easier for anyone to work out how to fix it if the env trick
fails. For the example #!, I'd use /usr/local/bin as it is the default
prefix when compiling zsh and fairly common for perl too. I'm not
fussed though - having consistency is worth more.

The only one which slightly concerns me is Test/ztst.zsh but I don't
know much about the workings of the test system. As long as make check
will always work.

Setting the #! lines would be quite simple from configure but I'm not
sure it is worth it for the extra complexity and potential for things
to break.

Oliver
