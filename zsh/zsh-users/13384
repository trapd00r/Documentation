Thanks Peter, it is so good to know!

jro@dhws011: bindkey -M vicmd 'k' vi-up-line-or-history
jro@dhws011: bindkey -M vicmd 'j' vi-up-line-or-history

I'm flabbergasted that

1) Anyone would want to be at the end of a line and
2) That you change the default behaviour of ksh without putting anything in the doc..

But I'm overwhelmed that it works now.

Nope, when I hit esc nothing happens, I start typing nothing happens, I hit return
and zsh searches my history for
what I typed in the blind.

Thanks again for the above!!!
