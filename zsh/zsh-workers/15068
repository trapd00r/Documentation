Which signals would they be?  On my Solaris system here, I get more signals
with zsh than bash (although it's an oldish bash).  Are they system
specific, or pseudo-signals (like DEBUG) which the shell handles itself?
The former is probably a bug in our signal-finding script, the latter would
need some work.

By the way, we (well, I :-)) would be happy to hear about any suggestions
about bash compatibility.  We've tended to concentrate on plain Bourne
shell, but these days a lot of Linux/GNU-oriented users think of bash as
`the' shell, so we may need to think more about it.
