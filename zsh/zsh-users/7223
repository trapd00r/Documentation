If you just want to use it as is, just type M-x shell-script-mode (tab
completion works here, too), and it'll put you in Emacs' proper mode.  If
you want to tweak the syntax, the appropriate elisp file is the
non-obvious sh-script.el.  If you want to know how to make it
automatically detect zsh-ness and it's not already doing so (works for me
with no special effort in GNU Emacs if the file starts with #!/bin/zsh),
email me offline and I'll tell you what to put in your .emacs.
