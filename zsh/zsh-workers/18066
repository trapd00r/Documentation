You need zpty to run completion tests. It is just that nobody considered it
important enough to modify test handler to return something more meaningful
in this case.

Zpty is not built automatically for static version, you should modify
config.modules in build directory to include it in static build, do not
forget to run make prep after that, see comments in this files. But I am
afraid there were reports that zpty fails on HP-UX as well.

The very first question - is HPUXDYNAMIC defined in config.h?
