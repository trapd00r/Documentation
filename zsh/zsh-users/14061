Er, do you know which one you are running, or in what situation you are 
running each of them?

And do you get output (and is it correct) from col (and from colcrt)?

The next step would be turning on various debug options to perl; a 
quick glance at `perl --help` suggests -T, -u, and/or -W might be 
helpful.  Try any or all of those, and send the resulting output to the 
list, if the problem remains.
