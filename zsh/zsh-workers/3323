Well, there are several other OS'es missing from Etc/MACHINES.  Currently
I do not know about any 32 or more bit Unix like OS where zsh cannot be
compiled (at least after some little modifications).  Perhaps
Etc/MACHINES should only mention those systems where some manual
intervention may be necessary to compile zsh.
