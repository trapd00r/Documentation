Thanks.  I'll study this so I understand exactly what it means and
give it a try.

Do you mean to say that it's better to use expand-word, or are you
indicating here that there is some loss of control over interpretation
of patters by switching to expand-word?  If the latter, is it fully
mitigated by giving the zstyle command you mentioned?  I will need to
look into this in more depth so I can understand the full implications
of switching from complete-word to expand-word...
