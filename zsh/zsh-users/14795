The 'x' in -fx enables XTRACE, which traces everything, but that should 
get you a clean start.  Maybe add the '+d' flag (zsh -f +d) which 
disables global rc files.  (I think only /etc/zshprofile can't be 
disabled.)

One other possibility is to check your key bindings.  I just noticed 
that there are 'menu-complete' and 'menu-expand-or-complete' bindings.  
Try:

$ bindkey | grep menu

If I first do:

$ bindkey '^I' menu-expand-or-complete
(^I is '<TAB>')

I get 'menu-complete' behavior regardless of the menucomplete setting.

Another (remote) possibility would be to check zstyle:

$ zstyle

That shouldn't list anything in a clean install.  Someone else can 
correct me if I'm wrong, but some of the things you can set with styles 
appear to involve menu completion.
