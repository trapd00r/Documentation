Hmhm, seems sensible.

I was about to mention the same when this mail came.  The only thing I
can think of is to make _command_names use only -g, not -/ (it will
revert to directory completion if there is no executable anyway).  Or
maybe do that only if autocd is set and _command_names is called from
_autocd.  Or something.

I think that's the reason, yes.  That plus oversight.
