Hrm.  As nearly as I can tell, this documentation became wrong when the
(N) glob qualifier was introduced.  If CSH_NULL_GLOB overrides (N), all
sorts of bad things happen, so it doesn't.  I just tried zsh-2.4, and
NULL_GLOB still takes effect even in combination with CSH_NULL_GLOB in
that version, too.  I think it should read "Overrides NOMATCH."
