Most recent versions of mv or cp warn you if there are more than two
arguments and the last argument is not a directory.

Subject: the mv trap

Hi
One of unix's little traps is when you intended to move some files to a 
directory but you mis-typed the destination directory and instead copied all

your files to a file created with the mistyped folder name as name. In fact 
this file becomes a kind of a black-hole for all but the last listed files

This is made worse if you don't notice your error.

Is there any Zsh solution/warning to this ?

> mv x1 x2 x3 x4 x5 directory
