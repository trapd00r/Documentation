The \a is the endcode for the title setting command, it is just an
arbitrary value really, as much as \e and ] are. That said, I don't
think this command works if you put literal \a on your command line.
This is what I use:

#for changing a *term title
function ct() {
  local MATCH
  if [[ "$1" = "-e" ]]; then
    #nulls terminate the string when printed, so change them
    printf '\e]0;%s\007' ${${${2//$'\x00'/\^@}//
/\\n}//(#m)[$'\x00'-$'\x1f']/$'\x16'$MATCH}
  elif [[ "$1" = "-t" ]]; then
    pts="$2"
    ct -e "$3" > /dev/pts/$pts
  else
    ct -e "$*"
  fi
}

To be honest, I can't say off hand what all those parts do, they're
sort of stacked on top of eachother until it stopped letting anything
through.

My actual preexec() calls it like this:
if [ "$#1" -gt 512 ];then 1=${1[1,512]}; fi
ct -e "$TTY:t [$1] {`print -P "%100<...<%~%<<"`} `strftime "%x %T"
$EPOCHSECONDS`"
