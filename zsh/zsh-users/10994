*sigh*... two out of three times, I reply to the sender and not the
list.  My apologies, Bart.

I didn't know that you can define two functions at once like that...
that's kinda cool.  I was thinking about doing it that way, and it's
certainly less complicated than what I came up with, but I like the
way that no matter how many lines are being edited in the current
buffer, the indicator always appears on the line below.  Yours is
certainly more clever, and certainly more portable, but I prefer the
way mine looks.  I am still considering ways to improve upon it,
though.  Since I'm almost always running inside of a session in gnu
screen, I might just set zsh up so that the current mode appears in
the screen caption line.

Thanks for the suggestion, though!
