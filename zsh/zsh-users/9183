Make sure you have an up-to-date zsh.  There were one or two bugs in
pattern matching that got fixed earlier this year to do with character
counting and termination.

If it's still happening, it may be there is a file with non-ASCII
characters which is still confusing zsh: lots of such problems have been
fixed but it won't surprise me if some are left.  It would be useful to
narrow the problem down to a particular set of files or directory
subtree.
