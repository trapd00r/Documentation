Of course I tried it. I always try to try things.

And that's exactly what I want, too.

I wondered about this, too, but what I meant was cases where there are 
also other strings so that get a list anyway.

Ok, it would also be cool, somehow, if we could hide matches for one
type when they are overridden by another type. But this would
definitely require C-code support and I have no idea how to do that in 
a generic way. And, as I said, I have the impression that in
completely ambiguous cases I would like to see the list (no, I can't
really explain why).

Bye
 Sven
