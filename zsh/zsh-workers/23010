Hi,

I think it would be really helpful if the completion function of iwconfig
could check the output of ‘iwlist $word[1] scanning’ for possible essids
and give them as completion. Something like this:

#v+
essid)  _wanted -x names expl 'network name' compadd \
   $(iwlist $words[1] scanning 2>/dev/null | sed -n '/ *ESSID:/ { s/.*:"//; s/"$//; p;}') \
    off any on ;;
#v-

Bye, Jörg.
