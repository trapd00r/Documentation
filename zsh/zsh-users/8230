It is described, it's just not as clear as it could be.

The synopsis says:

  fc [ -e ENAME ] [ -nlrdDfEim ] [ OLD=NEW ... ] [ FIRST [ LAST ] ]

and then the text says (in part):

     If the -l flag is given [...]  Otherwise the editor
     program ENAME is invoked on a file containing these history
     events.  If ENAME is not given, the value of the parameter FCEDIT
     is used.  If ENAME is `-', no editor is invoked.  When editing is
     complete, the edited command is executed.

So although it doesn't mention "-e", it describes the argument of -e, and 
you can't give the argument without giving the option, so ...
