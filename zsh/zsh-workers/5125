Just for the first interactive shell on the terminal. Background shell
doesn't fall in that category. But why should a background shell attempt
to initialize the terminal? It seems to me that background shell shouldn't
call that function. On a related matter, does subshell initialize terminal?

I thought it was at that point, but diff didn't provide enough context and
I'm without sources.
