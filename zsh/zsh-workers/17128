Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

There seems to be a very large diff to Doc/Makefile.in that was committed
along with the changes for the zselect module (17081).  It doesn't look
right to me -- it seems to have reverted a number of changes that were
made quite some time ago to make certain target files land in $(sdir)
rather than in the architecture-specific build tree.

Peter?
