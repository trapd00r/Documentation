$((a * 3)) is unspecified as per POSIX if $a doesn't contain an
integer constant. That was my point.

If $a contains an integer constant such as -3, then as per
POSIX, $((a * 3)) should be the same as $(($a * 3)), that is
$((-3 * 3)). If we extend that to the non-POSIX **, that would
be:

a=-3; $((a ** 2)) should be the same as $((-3 ** 2)).

So, if a future version of POSIX adds a **, it is bound to
specify it as $((-3 ** 2)) == 9 if it wants to keep consistant.

That would even be in accordance with all the existing shell
implementations that have **.

So, I think that with SH_PRECEDENCE, $((-3 ** 2)) should give 9.
