% Src/zsh -f
bolyai% bindkey '^j' self-insert
bolyai%

Now press ^J twice type anything and press ^J again.  The first character you
typed will disappear from the screen.  If there are more lines the first
character after each blank lines will disappear.  It is very bad in zed.

This appeared between beta11 and beta13 (I did not even compile beta12 since I
was too busy).

The other bug:

% Src/zsh -f
bolyai% setopt autolist listambiguous 
bolyai% compctl -U -s 'fo1 fo2 fo3' foo
bolyai% foo fo<TAB>

This tab does not show the list of available completions but ^D still works
for that.

Bye,
Zoltan
