Yes, I know about that. And that's what I've been using until now. But 
it's also exactly what I not what. I don't what to give the command an 
empty pattern. Compare:

% rm non-existing-file.*
zsh: no matches found: non-existing-file.*

% rm non-existing-file.*(N)
rm: missing operand
Try `rm --help' for more information.

I just want rm not to be executed (like it's the default) but without 
the error (which is fine when I do it interactively but not in a 
script).
