\M means character with high bit added. It is quite unlikely that your=20
terminal (emulator) actually produces this when you press Alt-H - I get=20
ESC-H:

{pts/1}% xxd
^[h
0000000: 1b68 0a                                  .h.

and this is exactly what run-help is bound to:

{pts/1}% bindkey | grep run-help
"^[H" run-help
"^[h" run-help


So just check what run-help is bound to on your termnial and rebind this=20
sequence.

Arguably zsh should treat \M-x and ESC-x interchangeably; I believe it even=
=20
was the case once but my memory fails me here.

P.S. thank you for chance to look at it - this gives me the whole lot of ne=
w=20
shortcuts to use :)
