I have to completely agree with Peter here.

I have both history-search-backward and history-beginning-search-backward
bound to keys, and use them for different things, but in both cases I
expect them to work on partial words; the only difference I expect is
whether they match against a prefix of the first word or a prefix of the
whole line.

I think you have no idea how wrong you are.

Exactly.

I can't accept that as sufficient in this case.
