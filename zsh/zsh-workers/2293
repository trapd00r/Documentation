Well, here's the installation script:

#! /bin/sh

set -e

install-info --quiet --section "General Commands" "General Commands" \
        /usr/info/gzip.info.gz

I put a -x in the set command, and it does work well. However,
install-info is a perl script! I could post it, but it has 352
lines... I can send it personally if necessary.
