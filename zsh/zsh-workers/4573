I have no idea where this fixsuffix() in docompletion() comes from
(looking at the various versions of 3.1.4 I have and the last few
hundred mail messages).
As I wrote in another message this may be a issue of personal
taste. If we put a fixsuffix() there any suffix on the line that is
autoremovable will become fixed when completion is tried in any way
(listing matches, completion with no matches, ...).

Bye
 Sven
