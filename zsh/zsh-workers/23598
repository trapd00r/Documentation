It would probably nice to be able to configure the order in which it
searched files and whether to stop when it found a match.  You could do
that if there tags ssh-config, ssh-hosts-global, ssh-hosts-local,
although that doesn't fit will with the known-hosts-files.  I'm not
really sure what the best way of doing it is, but anyway you might have
thought people would want to be able to search ~/.ssh/config before
the global /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts.  In practice this probably isn't a
big issue.
