In zshguide.pdf (around page 227) there is some discussion on  
EXTENDED_GLOB: it's part of that.
g^h is the pattern  "everything starting with g but not matching "h"  
exactly ". You happened to have exactly
one file starting in 'g',  I suppose (the final h seemingly matching  
is coincidental).
E.g. if I have 2 files "good" and "growth" then g^h matches them both,  
with EXTENDED_GLOB set.
In short: it becomes a globbing pattern by virtue of the presence of ^
