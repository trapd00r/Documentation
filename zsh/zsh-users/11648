} How would one have the pattern "#dir" (perhaps defined via a regex)
} autocomplete using tab, invoking a script with the match (e.g. $
} myAutoComp.py dir), which returns a newline-delimited list of possible
} completions to feed into the completion engine?

I don't know how to interpret the "defined via a regex" part, but take a
look at the modify-current-argument function packaged with recent versions
of the shell.  (It's probably too recent to have been mentioned in the
zshguide link above.)
