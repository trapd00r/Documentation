I can only think of one occasion when I've received a non-spam email
with content type text/html -- that alone is a good spam indicator.
There's also a huge number of people that have the poor taste to send
a multipart of text/plain and text/html, which also deserves to be
discouraged but isn't a good spam indicator.
