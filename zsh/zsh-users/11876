I'd like to have a mechanism such that I can type $FOO<TAB> and have it =
expand to the following which I can then manually edit further:
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Citrix\Web Interface\5.0.0\sitemgr.exe" -c =
"WIDest=3D1:/Citrix/AccessPlatform,Config=3DLocal,XMLService=3Dbeanstalk:=
80"

I've tried:
PF=3D"C:\Program Files (x86)"
FOO=3D"$PF\Citrix\Web Interface\5.0.0\sitemgr.exe -c =
\"WIDest=3D1:/Citrix/AccessPlatform,Config=3DLocal,XMLService=3Dbeanstalk=
:80\""

.. but this expands the value into a single escaped string:
$ C:\\Program\ Files\ \(x86\)\\Citrix\\Web\ =
Interface\\5.0.0\\sitemgr.exe\ -c\ =
\"WIDest=3D1:/Citrix/AccessPlatform,Config=3DLocal,XMLService=3Dbeanstalk=
:80\"

If I try `setopt shwordsplit' (which I don't really want), the spaces in =
the expanded path are no longer quoted causing the cmd to fail:
C:\\Program Files \(x86\)\\Citrix\\Web Interface\\5.0.0\\sitemgr.exe -c =
\"WIDest=3D1:/Citrix/AccessPlatform,Config=3DLocal,XMLService=3Dbeanstalk=
:80\"=20
zsh: command not found: C:\Program

I also don't want the double-quotes to be quoted in the expansion.


Any ideas how to do this?

Thanks,

=A0=A0=A0 --- John=20
