I'm going to punt on #1 and #2 due to lack of time.  Until git gets
a convenient way of outputting all the commands and descriptions
I think we're stuck hardcoding them.  I'm adding annex and submodule
(it was claimed that someone is working on submodule completion now).
I don't know where annex belongs.  Hopefully someone will move it
and write completion for it.

As for #4 I agree.
