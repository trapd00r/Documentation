Subject: "Cancel" menu selection & Co?

Currently, as soon as menu selection is started, there seems to be no way
to cancel it - that is, revert input line to original state. The closest
it, exit menu selection and hit Undo.

Does anybody really use ^G to switch from menu selection to menu
completion? I hardly see any point here. So, the suggestion is, to make ^G
really cancel selection and revert line to it's original state (before
match was inserted). This is also consistent behaviour for ^G, that
normally cancels actions in other places.

As a related (to me at least) question or request - is it possible to
enter menu selection immediately if list does not fit on screen? May be,
not always (if somebody just wants a list with ^D he prkbably does not
want menu selection). OTOH if menu selection can be quit with ^G it can be
used as replacement for listing, but replacement that supports scrolling,
paging, going back etc.

And it just ocured to me, that you may want to set completion (at least,
how the results are presented) differently for different widgets. One for
complete-word, another for delete-char-or-list etc. Is it
possible? E.g. enetr menu selection with complete-word, but show list
anyway with d-c-o-l.
