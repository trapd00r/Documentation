I was running a java command line which works well when you type it into the command line. As soon as you put it in a
script it works as if the double quotes were not there .. I run it from a Perl script and it works well.

So I decided to stick the set -x to see what was happening and saw the single quote.

The Java expects to see the line like this:

-a p1vkg/Bis1234/"XXXXXXXX XXXXXXX XX"

If it does not get it exactly like this it fails.. And it fails when I run it the way I describe above.

It looks like this is not going to work this way, we will have to do it differently.

Thanks everyone, we'll work around it..
