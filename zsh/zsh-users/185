You can do simple selective history on particular commands if you have
HIST_IGNORE_SPACE set and then alias certain commands like this:

alias fg=' fg'

Since alias expansion is done before most other things, including
history storage, this will ensure that 'fg' is never inserted into
command history.

Naturally it's not as flexible as using regular expressions or whatever,
but it's a start.
