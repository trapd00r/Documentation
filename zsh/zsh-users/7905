It seems that I need to reread all the documentation concerning the
completion system.

The date of the Zsh user guide is 1999/06/02; is it really that old?
It seems to have been rewritten since.

I see. And is it possible to have some kind of realtime filtering in
a menu selection, like interactive search but reducing the displayed
matches at the same time?

Being able to scroll would be sufficient IMHO.
