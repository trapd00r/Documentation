Sorry, I probably only confused things by mentioning that point. It only
really matters if you use matching control. For example, if you want
case-insensitive matching. If $PREFIX contains `mo', mo* would not match
a file named More while just adding * as matches allows the completion
matching control to decide for itself which files match.

-W only controls the way the -f option works. The string is added to the
WORDS purely for the purpose of finding out whether the match refers to
a regular file, a directory or whatever. -W has no effect on what the
list of matches will be. Try removing the -W and -f options from compadd
and use `-S /' instead if you want.

Whether it is before or after makes no difference. The string following
-W has nothing to do with matching.
