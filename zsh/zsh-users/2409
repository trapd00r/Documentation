Subject: deleting history
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

is there a way of deleting entries in the history?

also, is there a way of preventing commands from being added to the
history?
I'm not talking about preceding them with a blank.
Let say I'll issue a bunch of different commands, going back to them
in no particular order. When I'm done, I'd like those commands only to
be
erased. Something like
do_not_log_this_commands_for_good_but_just_for_now.
Something like an alternate history.

Thanks.
