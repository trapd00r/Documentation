I have Emacs bindings set, and C-t bound to gosmacs-transpose-chars.
When C-t is typed as the first characters of a line, the cursor moves
to beginning of the previous line, and everything typed with the cursor
in that position comes out strange: ``a'' is ^ß (beta), most other letters
come out as ^@.  Hitting C-k causes a coredump.

Typing one character, and then hitting C-t causes the typed character
to be changed to a ^@ and the cursor jumped to the previous line.

I am on Linux pre2.0.8 if that makes any difference.

    if (cs < 2 || line[cs - 1] == '\n' || line[cs - 2] == '\n') {
        if (line[cs] == '\n' || line[cs + 1] == '\n') {
            feep();
            return;
        }
        cs += (cs == 0 || line[cs - 1] == '\n') ? 2 : 1;
    }
    cc = line[cs - 2];
    line[cs - 2] = line[cs - 1];
    line[cs - 1] = cc;

Also, transpose-chars Does The Right Thing.
