Presumably csh incompatibility isn't such an issue nowadays?  I think
Solaris gives ksh as the default, and of course Linux and *BSD people
presumably would choose bash more than csh, so compatibility with ksh
and bash would be more important?

I'm not entirely sure, though.  Most people here seem to use csh or
tcsh, for whatever reason.
