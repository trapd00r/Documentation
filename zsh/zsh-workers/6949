Err, this works for me -- of course the completion code takes care to
count the lines (including wrapping) correctly. However, this will
only work if the COLUMNS parameter is correctly set (and the terminal
doesn't do automatic word-wrapping like your mailer ;-).

Are you sure that your COLUMNS information is correct?
