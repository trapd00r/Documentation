I'd like to use read with the -q and -toptions together, like so:

  read -q -t 10 '?Load Screen? (10 seconds, default Y) [Y/n] '

And have it read a y or n, but timeout the read if it's not answered in 10 
seconds.  I am doing this to have my login shells not always kick other ones 
off, as I use GNU screen for when I login from my phone, but not (usually) 
otherwise (and not always on the phone, sometimes I move it).

Is there a way to do this?  It seems that combining -q and -t results in 
weirdness that ultimately doesn't work.
