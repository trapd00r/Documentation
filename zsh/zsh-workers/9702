} Now you can give configure a comma-separated list of modules not to compile
} nor install as --enable-omit-modules=zsh/example,zsh/zpty.

It'd be nice to have a configure switch to replace the mymods.conf file.

} Having to use the `enable' in front is a bit tacky, but as far as I
} can see there's no way round it.

Perhaps this could be combined with the mymods.conf remark above by having
a negation syntax:

	--enable-modules=zsh/stat,\!zsh/example,\!zsh/zpty

This would be merged with the mymods.conf file, which could also have the
`!' syntax added; of course the configure command line should win if both
are present.

} There's no restriction on what you can omit, so it requires a bit of
} discretion on the part of the compiler.

I'll say.
