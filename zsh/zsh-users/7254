Yes, I did try the nocaseglob option, but it doesn't seem to work for the
completion (with the default bindings for the tab key, at least).

If I do `ls c:/win*', then it will expand to c:/WINDOWS, but it doesn't do
this for plain completion,
$ ls c:/win<tab>

Unfortunately using matcher styles makes the already hard-to-understand
_path_files even more difficult.

You could try running ^x? (_complete_debug) in place of completion.
That will at least show you what it's executing.  Unfortunately the output
is likely to be the size of the telephone directory.

Have you tried setting the new option nocaseglob?
