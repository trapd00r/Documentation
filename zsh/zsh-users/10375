I was hoping you weren't going to ask that...

I think a change of tack is the easiest way.  Instead of hacking the
_expand completer, which has some odd settings, the following goes
through the normal completer; the trick with _generic is to allow us
to use a widget bound to a key but still use the normal completion
logic.  Then we simply do the expansion by hand and add the results
unconditionally, i.e. without additional matching (compadd -U).  This
may have side effects but it seems basically OK.

_expand_java_path now contains:

  #autoload
  local MATCH MBEGIN MEND pref suf

  pref="**/${PREFIX//(#m)[[:upper:]]/${MATCH}[^[:upper:]]#}"
  suf="${SUFFIX//(#m)[[:upper:]]/${MATCH}[^[:upper:]]#}*.java"

  local expl
  local -a exp
  exp=(${~pref}${~suf}(N))
  if (( ${#exp} )); then
    _wanted java-files expl 'java source file (search)' \
      compadd -U -a exp
  else
    return 1
  fi

and .zshrc now requires the following setup:

  zle -C expand-java-path complete-word _generic
  zstyle ':completion:expand-java-path:*' completer _expand_java_path
  bindkey '^xj' expand-java-path
