As long as we can get info, I think that's good enough.  If makeinfo
produces DocBook output, is the reverse true?  I don't think we need
texinfo as such since we can get PDF another way.

(I would say, however, that neither of the obvious ways of turning
FO --- the intermediate output stage, akin to DVI --- into PDF is
entirely satisfactory.  Either you need a full Java set up or a
fairly particular TeX set up.  Both are subject to the multiple
dependency problems which will be familiar to anyone who's tried to
get, for example, Gnome's documentation system working from scratch
(though the actually dependencies are different in this case).)
