Sure.  A wrapper around an su command, for instance, which takes a
single argument for -c ... or anything else where a command wants a
shell sequence as one arg, but your csh-alias/*sh-func should just stick
all args after the nth into that.  I'm fairly sure I have something like
that knocking around somewhere.
