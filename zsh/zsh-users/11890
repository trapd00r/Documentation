man zshexpn; FILENAME GENERATION; Glob Qualifiers
line 1765...

 	More than one of these lists can be combined, separated by commas. 
The whole list matches if at least one of the sublists matches (they are 
`or'ed, the qualifiers in the sublists are `and'ed).  Some qualifiers, 
however, affect all matches generated, independent of the sublist in which 
they are given.

is it possible to AND two or more qualifiers? i read the part about 
BARE_GLOB_QUAL and EXTENDED_GLOB (does the former even exist?) and i 
haven't seen how to AND two or more qualifiers.
