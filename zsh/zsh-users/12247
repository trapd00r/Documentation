===================

  typeset -F SECONDS
  typeset -F 6 SECONDS
  print $[ ${SECONDS/./} % 10 ]

that will give "random" numbers between 0-9. adjust to just about any 
range you need.

or seed RANDOM like this:
  typeset -F SECONDS
  typeset -F 6 SECONDS
  RANDOM=${SECONDS/./}
  print $RANDOM

in both examples the `typeset` will only have to be done once per 
function.
