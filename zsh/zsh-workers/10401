:IIRC, Tanaka was maintaining his repository entirely as "cvs import"s of
:a master patch tree.  Thus before PWS's commit, every file in the whole
:repository appeared to be on the "vendor branch."  Now, only those files
:that PWS updated (patches between 10250 and 10376, so far) have trunk
:revision numbers (mostly 1.2) while the rest still appear to be on the
:branch (even though you get them with a main trunk checkout).

The other thing about doing imports:  >1200 tags - Umm, do we really need
all these still?  >1000 are of the form: zsh-workers_* 
I think sometime in the future when the tree is considered to be in 
a correct state, most or all of those can get deleted.  They make
``cvs log'' somewhat cumbersome (especially when it's nice to glance at
a tag list) and won't really serve any useful purpose.
