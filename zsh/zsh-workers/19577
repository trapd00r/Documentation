Hello,

since my installation of zsh 4.1.1, I have problems deleting special 
chars in the shell. I use german layout keyboard and deleting of umlauts 
like "ä", "ü" does not work any more. If I want to delete such a char I 
have to press the backspace key twice and the position of the cursor is 
broken. I used zsh version below 4.0 before, so I can't tell exactly at 
which version this happend. This is independent from the settings of the 
  shell, I tested this without a zshrc as well.

Thanks for any suggestions
Thomas

environment:
$ echo $TERM
