4.2.5-4 didn't show this behaviour, so maybe it's the newest patch.
${${foo}/?*/replacement} puts replacement in the prompt even when foo is empty
${foo/?*/replacement} works as expected.

On the command line, echo ${...} works as expected for both expressions,
printing nothing when foo is the empty string.
