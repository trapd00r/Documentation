Hi Citizens:

Is it possible to have more than one directory assigned to $HELPDIR 
like it is for $MANPATH?  I have a non-zsh $HELPDIR and that is making 
it impossible to use the zsh run-help on the help files I generated 
with zsh.  The run-help function seems only to work with one such 
directory entry.

Alternatively, can these helpfiles instead be generated as manpages?

Thanks in advance,

Bill
