I'm not sure why you want to to this, but try adding the -i option and
just for safety turn off ZLE:

* * * * *  zsh -ilc +Z "env" >& $HOME/out

This will force zsh to be an interactive shell and read more of the
startup files.  The -c option will still cause the shell to run only
the one command.  However, it may try to do terminal setup, so expect
some error output.
