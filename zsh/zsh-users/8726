Right, except replace "print" with "compadd", and you don't need the
$(( )) because the stuff in the [ ] is already treated as arithmetic.

    for i in {1..3}; do compadd $list[i*3]; done
or
    for ((i=3; $+list[i]; i+=3)); do compadd $list[i]; done

or any of a number of other ways.  There's not, however, a way to write
a single subscript parameter expansion that picks out non-contiguous
array slices.
