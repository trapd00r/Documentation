Mmmh, did you run autoconf between step 1 and step 3? I'm sorry that
my instructions were not clearer.

 1. patch

 2. run: autoconf

 3. run: ./configure

This is likely to be huge. If you did not forget to run autoconf as I
suspect, then please send me privately the strace output (bzip2'ed).
Strace should be run like this:

  strace -f -o strace.out /bin/sh -x ./configure

Thanks.
Phil.
