Two minor problems:

1. The tilde won't be expanded. (Some problem with quotes when you set 
CDPATH?)

2. As with 'PATH', CDPATH should contain the folder that contains the 
thing you're looking for.

So, the following should work to set up what you want:

CDPATH=~/DEMOG/PAPERS-PRESENTATIONS-ETC/DISSERTATION

(Note the lack of quotes.)


Personally, when I want something like this, I set up a named alias for 
the directories:

hash -d assignment=~/lti/11-741/3/assignment
hash -d writeup=~assignment/writeup

Then I can do:
% ~a<Tab>
% ~assignment<Enter>

to cd to /home/bhaskell/lti/11-741/3/assignment

It seems a little more controlled than CDPATH, and you can use it in more 
situations (not just 'cd'). ( e.g. rm ~writeup/bhaskell-3.pdf )

Best,
Ben
