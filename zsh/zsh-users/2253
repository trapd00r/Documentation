	i could swear you asked this sometime last year, too... i think the 
eventual answer was something like "have your preexec reset an IDLETIME
variable, and then start a background process that checked the value of
IDLETIME every so often and did something if it hadn't been reset in the
relevant time period".
	the details should be in the archives.
