Really, the correct general solution to this is to fall back on the=20
tool that zsh's extended glob attempts to make obsolete: GNU find.=20
Despite its arcane and annoying syntax, it's still occasionally useful.=20=

In this case, you want to say

find *(@) -name dry -exec ls '{}' ';'
--=20
     __                      __
    /  )                    /  )
   /--/ __. .__  ______    /  / __. , __o  _  _
  /  (_(_/|_/ (_(_) / (_  (__/_(_/|_\/ <__</_/_)_
