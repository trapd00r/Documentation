If you are using vi-keybinding (bindkey -v), then typing ctrl-W twice
will do what you want.
If you are using emacs-keybinding, then you can bind the command
'vi-backward-kill-word' to any key you like, e.g.,

bindkey '^W' vi-backward-kill-word

Another method is

% cd /home/example/one/../<TAB>

this will complete the directories in /home/example/.
