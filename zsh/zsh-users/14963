Hi
This is kind of a generic/dumb question I use zsh on cygwin.

So cygwin provides egrep now some of things grep can do are superceded by for 
instance zsh's **/*.php recursion  but presumably I could still use egrep's -
R. Am I right in thinking egrep knows nothing about the fact that its shell 
is  zsh.?!

Where are the boundaries between a shell and the tools
