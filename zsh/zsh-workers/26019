I just tried to do

git log --no-merTAB

in kernel tree. It took me around 5 minutes to get prompt back.

My system is not entirely modern and I have kernel compilation running
right now - still, this is a bit too much for completing a simple command
option. And I stopped futile attempts at completing file names from
repository long ago.

Any chance to make options completion a bit faster? This is 4.3.9.
