Hm. In this ugly Web-Interface we have (in the list), the state isn't
shown, so you can only tell if a bug is (supposed to be) fixed after
clicking on it etc. I think it would be nice to keep the list of open
bugs small -- but of course that's only really a problem when there
are more than there are now.

Bye
 Sven
