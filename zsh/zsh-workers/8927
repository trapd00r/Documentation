For an example screenshot of how they're supposed to look:

Yep, this had already occurred to me, and made me realise for the
first time ever (duh) that in fact the ANSI colour order does directly
follow RGB:

  code | colour  | RGB
 ------+---------+-----
    0  | black   | 000
    1  | red     | 100
    2  | green   | 010
    3  | yellow  | 110
    4  | blue    | 001
    5  | magenta | 101
    6  | cyan    | 011
    7  | white   | 111

Sorry, that was probably almost insultingly obvious to anyone with a
brain (that is, everyone here except me :-)

But then that doesn't usually help determine intermediate colours for
a gradient, because there isn't enough granularity when you're working
at 3-bit colour depth.  So I left it to the user in the end.
