expand-cmd-path is a great widget. Is there a similar thing for turning =
the current word into an absolute path? Sometimes I'm typing a ../../.. =
chain and would like to see how far I've gone. This should be easy with =
a widget function and :a but I don't want to write it if even less work =
is needed.

Thanks!
