} What does the -l argument to zsh do?

It sets the LOGIN option, which causes zsh to source the /etc/zprofile,
~/.zprofile, /etc/zlogin, and ~/.zlogin files at startup, and if the
shell is also interactive, to source the ~/.zlogout file at exit.

Hmm, it's probably a bug that the shell need only be a login shell to
source the zlogin files, but must be both a login shell and interactive
to source the zlogout files.  Nevertheless, that's the way it's been for
a very long time.

} Not sure I understand the difference between a shell and a
} "login shell".

There isn't any other difference between a shell and a login shell.

} Also, does zsh update wtmp/utmp files on login, or is this the
} getty's job?

Yes, that's the job of whatever process starts zsh; usually getty (more
accurately, /bin/login as started from getty), but sometimes "xterm -ls"
or the like.
