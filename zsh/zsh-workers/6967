Subject: PATCH: pws-25: _path_files return status
Date: Sun, 04 Jul 1999 15:47:59 +0200
From: Peter Stephenson <pws@ibmth.df.unipi.it>

I've got some completion function improvements of my own to come, but
surely the following is necessary for the finally return status of
_path_files?  Success is if compstate[nmatches] is no longer equal to nm.
