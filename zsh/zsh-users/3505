Subject: rotating the history file

I like to have a massive history file so that I may ^R through it and
pick up a command typed maybe months ago (that is very useful for me),
however humungous history files are inelegant and I would like to
start rotating the file every few thousand entries or so.  Like log
files with log.1 .. log.2 .. log.3 .. log.n

There is not a built in zsh function for this, is there?

thanx
