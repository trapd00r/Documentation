Do we need to actually say it's deprecated? Can't we just remove that
part of the documentation and add a bit under the brace form about
expl. We can mention in the next release note and in a comment inside
_arguments that the feature is deprecated.

Yes, that's also pointless. Virtually nobody bothers to use it anyway.
Leaving the action empty is what most people have done (though varying
on whether to include the trailing colon). So we can get rid of that
from the documentation too.

I'll come up with a patch this weekend. Including finding all
the places we've used the initial space in existing functions.
