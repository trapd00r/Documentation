Yes, but unfortunately the man pages are weighing in at about 90
pages now.  The split was necessary to make them maintainable since
I'm planning on adding more detail to various sections. My intentions
since I made the split were to supply both split versions and a single
mega-manpage.  I just haven't gotten around to it yet.

Hmm... my vague plan was to have some type of perl script that created
a mega-manpage out of the pieces, but if this works, then this would
be easier.  Maybe use a simple sed script to put in the right path
names in zshall.1.
