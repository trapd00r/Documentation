Ah, yes.  I guess you have to already know what the argument to
insert-last-word does to understand the man page :-)  Now, is
there a way to call that with increasing argument values, i.e.

  first call  = Meta-1 insert-last-word
  second call = Meta-2 insert-last-word
  third call  = Meta-3 insert-last-word
