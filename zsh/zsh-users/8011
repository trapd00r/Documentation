Add this to your .zshrc:
autoload -U compinit
compinit

You can also run compinstall which lets you configure lots of
completion options on its way and adds a few lines to your .zshrc
then. I recommend this :-)

Uhm. Seems there is no completion for svn as of yet (for zsh
4.0.6 which I still run here). Is there one for zsh 4.2? Anybody?

You can use bash completion functions in zsh beginning with
version 4.2, so just add the completion for svn to zsh's
completion functions (and make sure your zsh is recent enough).
Should help if there is no zsh native function...
