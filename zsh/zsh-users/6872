Hmm... I'm not sure about this.

We discussed simply being able to bind `main' to vicmd and tweaking the
way viins and vicmd were hooked together.  It was easy to implement but
it wasn't popular for some technical reason I've forgotten.

The other way of doing it is to add a hook widget to zle to run every
time it starts.  That's not too hard, either, but nobody's got around to
doing it.
