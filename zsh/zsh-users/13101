That was my issue with building yodl on AIX. I think I'm better off
rewriting the makefiles :-\.

Of course, I could just generate the docs on Solaris or some BSD and
move the Doc directory to the AIX machine. Anyone see any fault in
that reasoning?

>From what I've seen this is already provided in the releases anyway
(as I didn't have the same issue building 4.2.7 or 4.3.7).
