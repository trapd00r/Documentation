Hm, nowadyas any key not explicitly caught by menu-select brings you
out of it (and continues normal menu-completion if it was started via
ZLS_SELECT).

Unless you want this only when menu-completion is active, you can
always by unsetting ZLS_SELECT and bind menu-select to some key
A. Then you can start menu-completion as normal and use A to enter
menu-selection (and again leaving menu-selection should put you into
normal menu-completion again).
