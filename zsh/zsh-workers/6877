[except that 6850 isn't because the shell hangs when called from sh.]
Somebody who's been looking at this will have to produce counter-patches
for pws-24, I'm not going to attempt this myself on a wing and a prayer.

If we can
  1) handle shell structures with well-behaved external programmes
     (i.e. not sh, ksh, zcat)
  2) suspend and interrupt functions running well-behaved external
     programmes (or none)
  3) not hang because of failed attempts to set the pgrp
then I think we should declare a truce before 3.1.6.
