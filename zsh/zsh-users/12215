Apparently because of POSIX conformance.
See http://bugs.debian.org/295421 and /usr/share/doc/diff/NEWS

And it wasn't actually -u taking a numerical argument before,
but a number could be a separate option, not necessarily
after -u, so eg. this also works:
_POSIX2_VERSION=3D199209 diff -2u /dev/null /etc/profile
