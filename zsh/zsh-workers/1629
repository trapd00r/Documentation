No, the manual is not wrong.  Filename expansion is different from filename
generation (which is also called globbing).  Filename expansion is always
performed on the right hand side of assignments and this behaviour is
compatible with other shell and POSIX.  GLOB_ASSIGN is not mentioned here
and I not not think it should be mentined at all.  It id documented in the
zshoptions page but it is really a _very_ deprecated option and it will
surely be removed sometime since it introduces unpredictable ambiguity into
the assignment (when the glob result in one word, the variable is assigned
as a scalar otherwise it is assigned as an array, which can cause
mysterious problems).
