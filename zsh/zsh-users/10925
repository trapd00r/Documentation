Subject: jobs -d &>/dev/null still produces output?
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8; format=flowed
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Content-Disposition: inline

I'm a bit confused by something zsh is doing.

Test case:

sleep 1000 &
jobs -d &>/dev/null

Why does this still produce output?  Is there any way to redirect the
line that's still appearing on screen?  And what on earth is the
'shout' file descriptor tied to?   :)

Thanks!

~Matt
