Did you 
----------------------------------------
source .zshrc
----------------------------------------

Try that.  Also, are you using a terminal emulator?  Pretty often the
terminal emulator inherits its login environment from the environment

otherwise log out entirely or start a new session.

Your blog is hilarious ;)
