It should really be documented.  In most cases the only differences from a
normal strftime() are the ones listed in the %D prompt expansion, and the
extra code is just to provide a fallback, but if an external strftime() is
not available there's no documentation at all, and if it's defective the
extra ones provided by zsh aren't documented.  There could even be clashes
with a non-standard strftime.
