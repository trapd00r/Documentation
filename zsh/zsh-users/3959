Oops, I must have overseen this. :)  However, thanks to the hint with
the double quotes, I could make my expression work:

mailpath=("$($HOME/bin/printmailfolders-zsh.pl)")

or

mailpath=("`$HOME/bin/printmailfolders-zsh.pl`")

does The Right Thing (TM).

Unfortunately, this doesn't work for me.  But as the other version's up
and running and more extensible (could parse every file if it's really a
mailbox, for example), this isn't a problem.

Thanks again for the help.
