Indeed - it seems such a basic problem that it ought be in the manual.
Btw, I find that manuals have way too far examples.  While I can understand
that not every example should be in a manual, the users would benefit A LOT
if the manual to their shell (read: ZShell) had more examples.

For now, I'll be adding more exmaples to my page about the zsh:
