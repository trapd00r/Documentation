Using zsh-3.0.0 on Solaris, if I start a program that sets non-blocking
input on stdin (using fcntl with O_NONBLOCK), and I then exit that program
using SIGINT (Ctrl-C), zsh doesn't seem to reset stdin back to blocking
input for future programs that the shell runs (though zle works fine).
cat reports

cat: input error on standard input: Resource temporarily unavailable

I can get around this problem with a simple C program to reset stdin
to blocking mode (turns off the O_NONBLOCK bit flag with fcntl). Is this a
bug?  Has this been fixed by any patches that are around?
Thanks
Greg
