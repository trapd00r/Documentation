This is pretty doable, but since I use file types I attacked that side
first to see what other snags came up... few did, so I went forward.  I
can easily add the code to both parts, or better, factor it out and make
it a little bit cleaner, too.

I looked through the color-ls patch, and have no idea what their copy
policy is.  My distribution of the patch is a single gz file, so it's hard
to say.  I've not been following the group long enough to know about a
history of GPL infection fright. :-)  It's actually not that complicated
an ordeal, but I don't believe in reinventing the wheel, plus it'd be
confusing if zsh colorized listing worked differently that ls's.  Anybody
know more about color-ls?
