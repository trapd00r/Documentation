That's what I understood the question to be.  And yes, isn't this how
zsh works right now?  I don't remember this being changed recently, so
I'd guess it's quite old behaviour?

I just tried with "zsh -f" (3.1.2-zefram3), and it has exactly the
behaviour you list above.  Not only that, but "chmod 670 foo" still
has foo not being displayed.
