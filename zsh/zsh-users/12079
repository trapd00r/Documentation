I think the problem is somewhere in the utility compfiles.  Given a path /
and a PREFIX c it should come up with a list of files at least including
"c", but it doesn't.  compfiles is incredibly obscure, but somewhere in
there it's doing globbing.

Does "print /*"  show everything you would expect?

Does setting
  zstyle ':completion:*' fake-files '/:c'
work around the problem?
