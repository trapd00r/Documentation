    Well, I'm by no means an expert, but as far as I know, Zsh does
parameter expansion *first* and brace expansion *last* in the same
step. As zsh does not reparse and rexpand, you need to first expand
the parameter and after that expand the braces. That's why you need
the eval.

    Of course, because (e) doesn't perform brace expansion ;)

    Sorry for not being much helpful O:) I'm sure that somebody here
can think of a solution without using "eval" (although that's why
eval exists...).

    Buena suerte, Lloyd, y encantado de hablar otra vez contigo :)
(Good luck, Lloyd, and pleased to talk with you again):
