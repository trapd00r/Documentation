Subject: copy the newest file
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Content-Disposition: inline

Hello again friends,

I am working on a little script that will run as a cron job and copy a
few files to another computer via scp.  I only want to copy the newest
one.  How do I get that newest file?  This is what I have figured out
so far:

/backups/daily/database*(om)

That will be a list of all the files starting with database and the
most recently modified first.  How can I just pick off the first one
from the list?  Also: where can I look in the man files for such
things?

Thanks!
