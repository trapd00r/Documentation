A lot of sh's don't like it.  I've always avoided doing that in
Makefile scripts, including the ones I've been writing for zsh.  There
are two usual workarounds:

list='$(POSSIBLY_EMPTY_VARIABLE)'
for foo in $list; do
  ...
done

for foo in .. $(POSSIBLY_EMPTY_VARIABLE); do
  if $foo != ..; then
    ...
  fi
done
