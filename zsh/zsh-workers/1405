>What does POSIX say?

POSIX requires the SH_WORD_SPLIT behaviour.  It also requires field
splitting in normal words, as well as the result of expansions:

% setopt SH_WORD_SPLIT
% IFS=x
% echo fooxbar
fooxbar

$ IFS=x
$ echo fooxbar
foo bar

I think we should implement this behaviour -- when SH_WORD_SPLIT is
set, of course.  It should be very easy.  I also think we should retain
the current default, as it's much nicer behaviour.
