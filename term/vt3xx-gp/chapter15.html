<H1 ID="S15"><SPAN CLASS="chapnum">15</SPAN> Using a Mouse or Tablet</H1>
<H2 ID="S15.1">Locator Devices</H2>
<P>This chapter describes how to program your VT300 terminal for use with a
locator device. You use a locator device to move the cursor and select position
coordinates on the screen. With a locator device, you can easily move the
graphics input cursor to a specific point or enter data to application programs.</P>
<P>There are two locator devices you can use with your terminal, a mouse or
graphics tablet. You connect the device to the rear of the terminal. These devices
use a serial line input/output format with the micro-DIN connector.</P>
<H2 ID="S15.2">VSXXX-AA Mouse</H2>
<P>Digital's VSXXX-AA mouse is a small handheld device, with three buttons on
top and a roller ball on the bottom. You can write applications that use the
mouse as an input device. You can use the three buttons on the mouse to send
data to an application.</P>
<P>The roller ball controls cursor movement. When you move the mouse on a flat
surface, the roller ball turns. The cursor moves in the direction you move the
mouse. You can move the cursor in any direction, and place it anywhere on the
screen.</P>
<P>If you pick the mouse up, the cursor stops moving on the screen. The cursor
stays at this point until you put the mouse down and move the roller ball along
the surface again.</P>
<H2 ID="S15.3">VSXXX-AB Graphics Tablet</H2>
<P>Digital's VSXXX-AB tablet has three parts.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Tablet</LI>
<LI>Puck</LI>
<LI>Stylus</LI>
</UL>
<P>The <DFN>tablet</DFN> has a flat, square surface similar to a tabletop. To move the cursor,
you move the puck or stylus over this surface. The tablet has a position-sensitive
grid that senses the position of the puck or stylus.</P>
<P>The <DFN>puck</DFN> is a handheld device with crosshair markings that help you select
precise coordinates on the tablet. The puck has four buttons that serve the
same purpose as the buttons on the mouse. You can program the buttons to
send position reports when pressed or released.</P>
<P>The <DFN>stylus</DFN> is a handheld device that resembles a pen. The stylus has two buttons,
a barrel and a tip. The barrel is a button on the side of the pen you can
press to send data to an application. You activate the tip by pressing the pen
down onto the tablet surface.</P>
<P>To move the cursor, you move the puck or stylus over the tablet surface. You
do not have to touch the surface, but the tablet or stylus must be within 0.65
cm (0.25 in) of the surface to move the cursor. When the puck or stylus is
close enough to the tablet surface to move the cursor, the puck or stylus is in
<DFN>proximity</DFN> with the tablet.</P>
<P>If you remove the puck or stylus from the tablet surface while the tablet is
plugged in, then the VT300 uses the last known tablet position.</P>
<P>Unlike the mouse, the tablet is an absolute positioning device. The layout of
the tablet corresponds roughly to the layout of the screen. The next section
explains tablet-to-screen mapping.</P>
<H3 ID="S15.3.1">Tablet-to-Screen Mapping</H3>
<P>The VT300 screen maps to the bottom two-thirds of the tablet surface.
Applications cannot use the top third of the tablet. The points at the top third
of the tablet map to the top visible scan line of the screen.</P>
<P>The complete horizontal extent of the tablet's coordinate system maps to the
complete horizontal extent of the screen. However, the tablet has borders to
compensate for the difference between the screen's coordinate system and the
tablet's system.</P>
<P>The vertical extent at the bottom of the tablet's coordinate system maps to the
complete vertical extent of the screen. The tablet must also have borders in the
vertical direction.</P>
<P>The origin of the tablet's coordinate system is at the lower-left corner of the
tablet surface, so the lower Y coordinates on the tablet map to the horizontal
extent of the screen. The upper Y coordinates map to the top scan line of the screen.</P>
<H2 ID="S15.4">Locator Cursor</H2>
<P>The VT300 can use any one of the following cursor styles with a
locator device.</P>

<P>In ReGIS mode, software can select the cursor style by using the cursor control
option to the screen command: S(C(I)). See <A HREF="chapter2.html">Chapter 2</A> for details on the
ReGIS screen command.</P>
<P>In 4010/4014 mode, the terminal only uses the crosshair cursor style.</P>
<H2 ID="S15.5">Locator Buttons</H2>
<P>In graphics input mode, pressing a locator button sends a cursor position report
to the host. The mouse has three buttons. The graphics tablet includes a
puck with four buttons, and a stylus with a barrel button and a tip switch. All
the buttons serve the same purpose &#8211; they send locator data to the host.</P>
<P>A locator button can be in one of two states, up (released) or down (pressed). A
change from one state to another is called a transition. You can program the
buttons to send reports in three different ways.</P>
<UL>
<LI>When pressed</LI>
<LI>When released</LI>
<LI>When pressed or released</LI>
</UL>
<P>You can also program the locator buttons to send specific codes or control functions
to the host. Programming locator buttons is described later in this chapter.
<A HREF="#T15-1">Table 15-1</A> shows the default codes that each button sends when pressed or
released.</P>

<H2 ID="S15.6">Entering Data with the Locator Device</H2>
<P>Before you can enter data with a locator device, the terminal must be in a
graphics input mode. You can use three different graphics input modes with
the VT300.</P>
<UL>
<LI>ReGIS one-shot graphics input mode</LI>
<LI>ReGIS multiple graphics input mode</LI>
<LI>Tektronix GIN mode</LI>
</UL>
<H3 ID="S15.6.1">ReGIS One-Shot Graphics Input Mode</H3>
<P>An application can select this mode with the following ReGIS command.</P>
<P CLASS="example"><B>R(I0)</B></P>
<P>In one-shot mode, the terminal suspends processing of received characters and
commands. The terminal buffers all received characters, until it leaves one-shot
mode.</P>
<P>When the terminal enters graphics input mode, the input cursor appears on the screen.</P>
<H4 ID="S15.6.1.1">Moving the Graphics Cursor</H4>
<P>You can move the input cursor around the
screen by moving the locator device.</P>
<P><STRONG>Mouse</STRONG><BR>
The input cursor moves as you move the mouse over a flat surface.</P>
<P><STRONG>Tablet</STRONG><BR>
The input cursor moves as you move the stylus or puck across the tablet surface.</P>
<P><STRONG>Arrow Keys</STRONG><BR>
The input cursor moves as you press the corresponding arrow key on the keyboard.
If a mouse is connected to the locator port, you can use the arrow keys
or the mouse interchangeably to move the cursor. If a tablet is connected, you
can use the arrow keys to move the cursor only when the puck or stylus is not in
proximity with the tablet surface.</P>
<H4 ID="S15.6.1.2">Requesting a Cursor Position Report</H4>
<P>In one-shot mode, the terminal cannot
send a position report until the application sends a request to the terminal. You
use the ReGIS report position interactive command to request a position report.</P>
<P CLASS="example"><B>R(P(I))</B></P>
<P>After sending the report position interactive command, the application does not
receive a report until you press an active key or locator button.</P>
<H4 ID="S15.6.1.3">Sending a Cursor Position Report</H4>
<P>You can send a cursor position report from the keyboard or locator device.</P>

<A HREF="#T15-1">Table 15-1</A> lists the default codes. Digital's mouse has three buttons,
the tablet's puck has four.</P>
<P>Your application can redefine the codes that the locator buttons
send to the host. User-defined codes override the default codes. See
"<A HREF="#S15.8">Programming Locator Device Buttons</A>" later in the chapter.</P></LI>
<LI><P><STRONG>The terminal sends the position report.</STRONG><BR>
The terminal sends the current coordinates of the input cursor to
the host. The terminal sends this report as an absolute bracketed
extent in ReGIS coordinates (such as [X,Y]).</P></LI>
<LI><P><STRONG>The terminal exits one-shot mode.</STRONG><BR>
The graphics input cursor disappears from the screen when the terminal
exits graphics input mode.</P></LI>
</OL>
<H3 ID="S15.6.2">ReGIS Multiple Graphics Input Mode</H3>
<P>An application can select this mode with the following ReGIS command.</P>
<P CLASS="example"><B>R(I1)</B></P>
<P>In multiple mode, the user moves the cursor and sends reports as in one-shot
mode. Multiple mode differs from one-shot mode in the following ways.</P>
<UL>
<LI><P>The terminal processes characters and command as it receives
them from the host. This feature lets the terminal perform graphics
input and output at the same time.</P></LI>
<LI><P>The terminal does not exit graphics input mode after the terminal
sends a cursor position report. In multiple mode, the terminal can
send an indefinite number of position reports.</P></LI>
<LI><P>When you press a button or an application requests a report, the
terminal immediately sends a position report.</P></LI>
<LI><P>To exit multiple mode, the application must send the ReGIS R(I0)
command. The input cursor remains on the screen until the application
sends this command.</P></LI>
</UL>
<H4 ID="S15.6.2.1">Sending a Cursor Position Report</H4>
<P>In multiple mode, there are two ways
for the application to receive a report.</P>
<UL>
<LI><P><STRONG>Send R(P(I)) to the terminal.</STRONG><BR>
An application can request an immediate position report by sending
the ReGIS report position interactive command to the terminal.
When the terminal receives R(P(I)), it immediately sends a position
report to the application.</P></LI>
<LI><P><STRONG>Press a locator button.</STRONG><BR>
When you press (or release) a locator button, the terminal immediately
sends a position report to the application.</P></LI>
</UL>
<P><STRONG>Notes on Multiple Mode</STRONG></P>
<UL>
<LI><P>To exit multiple graphics input mode, you must exit ReGIS. To re-enter
multiple mode, you must use the ReGIS R(I1) command again.</P></LI>
<LI><P>You cannot use the four arrow keys to position the input cursor as
you can in ReGIS one-shot graphics input mode. If you press an
arrow key in multiple mode, the terminal sends that key's escape
sequence to the host. If the host system is set to echo all of the
input that it receives, then the escape sequence will be sent back
to the terminal, causing ReGIS to abort.</P>
<P>To prevent this, you should either</P>
<UL>
<LI><P>turn off the host system's echoing function (using a command
such as <B>SET TERM/NOECHO</B> on VMS), or</P></LI>
<LI><P>program your application to read terminal input in such a
way as to prevent echoing input back to the terminal.</P></LI>
</UL></LI>
</UL>
<H3 ID="S15.6.3">ReGIS Locator Reports</H3>
<P>Locator reports begin with the code(s) of the active non-arrow key or locator
button pressed. Following this code is the current position of the input cursor.
The terminal sends the input cursor position as an absolute bracketed extent in
user coordinates. The report ends with the carriage return character (CR).</P>
<P>The following list shows some examples of locator reports and their meaning.</P>
<UL>
<LI><P><STRONG>One-shot mode</STRONG></P>
<PRE>A[102,200]&lt;CR&gt;</PRE>
<P>The user pressed the letter 'A' with the cursor at position 102,200.</P></LI>
<LI><P><STRONG>One-shot or multiple mode</STRONG></P>
<PRE>&lt;CSI&gt;241~[102.5,200]&lt;CR&gt;</PRE>
<P>The user pressed the left mouse button with the input cursor at position
[102.5,200]. &lt;CSI&gt;241~ is the default sequence sent when
you press the left mouse button.</P></LI>
<LI><P><STRONG>Multiple mode</STRONG></P>
<PRE>&lt;CSI&gt;240~[100,100]&lt;CR&gt;</PRE>
<P>The terminal received the ReGIS report position interactive command
R(P(I)). &lt;CSI&gt;240~ is the <DFN>null button sequence</DFN>. The null button
sequence indicates this report is the result of an application
request, not a locator button transition. The cursor is at position
[100, 100].</P></LI>
</UL>
<H3 ID="S15.6.4">Synchonizing Locator Reports Between the Terminal and Application</H3>
<P>The way you synchronize input cursor position reports between the terminal
and your application depends on whether the terminal is in one-shot graphics
input mode, or multiple graphics input mode.</P>
<H4 ID="S15.6.4.1">In One-Shot Mode</H4>
<P>In one-shot mode, the terminal cannot send a report until
it receives the ReGIS R(P(I)) command. To synchronize reports, your application
must keep count of the R(P(I)) commands sent to the terminal.</P>
<H4 ID="S15.6.4.2">In Multiple Mode</H4>
<P>In multiple mode, the terminal can send a
report at any time. To synchronize reports, the application must be able to recognize
the format of each ReGIS input cursor position report. See "<A HREF="#S15.6.3">ReGIS
Locator Reports</A>" earlier in this chapter for the report formats.</P>
<H3 ID="S15.6.5">Tektronix Graphics Input (GIN) Mode</H3>
<P>Tektronix GIN mode is available only when the terminal is in 4010/4014 mode.
Tektronix GIN mode is similar to ReGIS one-shot mode. The cursor moves and
the terminal sends reports as in ReGIS one-shot mode.</P>
<P>An application can select this mode with the following escape sequence.</P>
<DIV CLASS="example"><TABLE CLASS="codeseq">
<TBODY>

</TR>
</TBODY>
</TABLE></DIV>
<P>The only input cursor available in Tektronix GIN mode is the crosshair. See
<A HREF="chapter13.html">Chapter 13</A> for the format of the 4010/4014 mode position report.</P>
<H2 ID="S15.7">Using a Locator Device with Dual Sessions</H2>
<P>This section describes how a locator device acts in a dual-session environment.
You may want to review the chapter on dual sessions (Volume 1, Chapter 14)
before you continue.</P>
<H3 ID="S15.7.1">Locator Device Attributes in a Dual-Session Environment</H3>
<UL>
<LI><P>The locator device and the keyboard share the same input buffer, so
they always send data to the same session. That is, the locator device
and the keyboard are always associated with the active session.</P></LI>
<LI><P>Each session independently selects graphics input mode. Either session
can use a locator device without affecting the other session.</P></LI>
<LI><P>The VT300 lets users display data from two sessions at the same
time, using windows. In this environment, the locator cursor
moves freely only in the active session's window. To change the
active session, use the <B>Switch Session</B> key.</P></LI>
</UL>
<H2 ID="S15.8">Programming Locator Device Buttons (DECLBD)</H2>
<P>You can program the locator device buttons to send codes that are different
from the default codes. <A HREF="#T15-1">Table 15-1</A> lists the default codes.</P>
<P>Programming locator buttons is similar to programming function keys on the
keyboard (Volume 1, Chapter 11). You use a device control string containing
button definitions.</P>
<P>There are three programmable buttons on Digital's mouse, four on the tablet's
puck, and two on the tablet's stylus. The VT300 lets you program all the buttons
on the device you use. Each button can send a different code when
pressed or released.</P>
<P>The VT300 lets you program up to six characters for each transition (up or
down).</P>
<P>The terminal does not save your locator button codes in nonvolatile RAM
(NVR). When you turn off or reset the terminal, you lose any locator button
codes you defined. Unlike user-defined keys (UDKs), you cannot program the
locator buttons from set-up.</P>
<H3 ID="S15.8.1">DECLBD Device Control String</H3>
<P>You use the following device control string to define the function of locator
buttons.</P>
<P CLASS="example"><B>DCS Pc $ w Ky1/Std1/Stu1 ;...; Kyn/Stdn/Stun ST</B></P>
<P>where</P>
<DIV CLASS="example"><P><B>DCS</B> (9/0) introduces device control strings. DCS is a C1 control character
