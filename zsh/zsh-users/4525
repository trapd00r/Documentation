if anyone knows how to do this without using the new completion system
i'd like to know about it.

i still don't really understand... is there a way to use parts of the
new completion system without loading the whole shebang? believe it or
not, there are certain things that i _don't_ want to complete (or that i
like doing my own way)... is there a way to load only specific functions
from the new system?
