No official version allows to do this in the completion code. But you
can probably use some bindkey-trickery:

  bindkey -s <SHIFT-TAB> '^H^I^I'
  bindkey -s <CTRL-TAB>  '^W^I'

This will only work if there is no `/' in your WORDCHARS parameter and 
if Control-W is bound to bachward-kill-word or backword-delete-word
(it's normally bound to backward-kill-word). Maybe I understood you
wrong and in the second case '^W^W^I' does what you want.
