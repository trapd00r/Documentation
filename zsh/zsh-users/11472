I really don't think there is a clear boundary. It's a matter of which
gets the job done (for you). In this case you found that implementing
the script in Perl did the job. Somebody else might have (equally
trivially) done the same thing in zsh, Ruby, or maybe even in Monty 
Python's Flying Circus.

There are a few cases where I would argue that Perl is definately a
better choice than zsh. Equally, there are a few cases where I would say
that zsh is definately the better tool for the job. In all other cases
(that huge grey zone in between), it all depends on which one you are 
more familiar with, what mood you are in, what you had for breakfast 
and so on.
