Well, there is a local fix for this, and it was being fed up with having to
use it when all I wanted was what seemed to me the standard output that
made me fix it this way.  If the usual output wasn't so non-standard I
wouldn't have thought about it.  But the [#0x] idea is a good one (and I
supposed `typeset -i 0x foo' would be a natural companion, though option
argument passing for builtins is currently horrible).
