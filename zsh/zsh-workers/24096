I've found another problem that seems to be caused by this patch
(located by git-bisect). When a bg'd job finishes, the cursor is drawn
in the wrong place in the new prompt (#bar characters to the left).
Pressing a key bound to reset-prompt fixes it.

The simplest test case i could find was
zsh -f
PS1="frobnizz %#"      #not really needed but since the default
depends on hostname...
RPS1="foo%(1j.bar.)"
