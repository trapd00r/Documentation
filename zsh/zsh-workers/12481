I'm not clear what `nozshdep' actually means.  Currently it's used only in
the main zsh module to avoid circular dependencies.  It's hard to conceive
of a real module that *doesn't* depend on the main executable.  It would
have to be some standalone thing (in which case config.h would not be
relevant).  Or maybe I've missed the point too.
