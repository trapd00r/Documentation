To all who helped try to figure out my Solaris x86 problem last week - it
turned out to be a serious problem in the installation of the compiler -
several include files (not just the suspect signal.h) were missing, in the
wrong place, or just messed up.  The admin re-installed gcc, and all is
fine.


Thanks again,
Scott
