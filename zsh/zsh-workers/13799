} This must have come up before, but I can't see it in the archives.

} The following scripts hardcode binary locations (excluding /bin/sh
} since if a system can't cope with that ...) :

The only reason that I've added #! lines anywhere is so that emacs will
start up in shell script mode and select the correct syntax.

}    Util/helpfiles           :   #!/usr/bin/perl -- -*-perl-*-

The -*- perl -*- is extraneous there, at least in newer versions of emacs.
It'll figure it out from the tail of the #! path.

}    Test/ztst.zsh            :   #!/usr/local/bin/zsh -f

That should be ".../zsh -f +Z".

} Can we avoid this?  Is env(1) common to enough platforms, for
} instance, or maybe we could add something to configure?

If you put env in the #! line -- or put the #! line anywhere but as the
first line in the script -- it foils emacs' algorithm for figuring out
which mode to start in.  Same issue if you put some kind of @...@ thing
for configure there.  Not that this should be the primary reason for any
decision that we make, but at least consider it.
