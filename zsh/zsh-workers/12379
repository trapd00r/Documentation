It used to be set by compinstall, but this was in the old days before
$fpath was set by default.  I rewrote $compinstall to manipulate $fpath
directly as a last resort but complain if it has to do so, which makes more
sense if $fpath is supposed to include the completion directories already.
It's now an internal matter for compinit (or compaudit).
