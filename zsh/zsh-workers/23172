Subject: PATCH: newline display problem in completion lists
Date: Tue, 13 Feb 2007 21:50:05 +0000

Good news on the problem where ^xh goes down too many lines.

You can see it quite easily:

_frob() { compadd -UX $'foo\nand\nbar' -n ''; }
compdef _frob frob
frob ^D

It turns out just to be a simple typo.  I'm extremely relieved.
