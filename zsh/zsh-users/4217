this is very strange.

i login to the host in question as root from a tty device. lala, regular
login stuff, zshrc, ps1, etc. then, if i try to type something,
anything, i get

zsh: error on TTY read: no such file or directory

then it logs me out. note that i am not actually typing a full command
and hitting enter, i get the error after typing only one letter.

if i connect to the host via ssh or telnet, everything is fine. if i
login from a tty using a different shell (ie, bash or ash), everything
is fine. if i login from a tty with another account that uses zsh,
everything is fine. 

this annoying problem has me stumped! so if anyone has any ideas, i'd
love to hear them.

i make the following predictions:

1. the solution is completely obvious (only not to me).
2. i will feel like a complete idiot once this is pointed out.

well then!
