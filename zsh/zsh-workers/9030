Sigh...  I'm terribly embarrassed.  I made the change more than a week ago, and
wanted to try it before sending it.  Then I made the patch with the latest
version of parameter.c rather than the original version.

I agree, there is a problem with the name space pollution.  I would suggest
that zsh is included in the name, like  ${.zshparam.jobdirs} or
${.zsh.param.jobdirs} (I'm not familiar with ksh).  I think if we say that
parameters beginning with zsh are reserved for future expansion, then there is
room for expansion without stepping on people's toes.
