I've made a test release zsh-2.6-beta9-test2.tar.gz
and put it in the testing directory of the archive.
I've been sorta busy this week so I haven't finished
a lot of the things I want to do before I release the
next beta.  So I want to work on it for another week
or so before I make a real beta release.

Check the ChangeLog for what I've added so far.
