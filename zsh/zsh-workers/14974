} Just did update on 4.0 and got relatively many changed files without any
} changelog entry. Unfortunately, I do not know how to get the list of files
} now again ... but there was e.g. _rpm and zshconfig.ac for sure.

Are you sure there's no ChangeLog entry?

Remember, I reordered the 4.0 ChangeLog to match the 4.1.0-dev-0 ChangeLog,
so some log entries may have dates earlier than the change dates of the
files.  E.g., here's the entry for _rpm:

2001-06-05  Chmouel Boudjnah  <chmouel@mandrakesoft.com>

        * 14550: Completion/Redhat/Command/_rpm: Add --nobuild and --nogpg
        to rpm completion
