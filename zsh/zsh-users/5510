    Hi Leon :)

> PROMPT=$(echo
> '%B%{\033[33m%}%n@\033[31m%}%m\033[39m%}:\033[32m%}[%~]\033[00m%}\033[34m%}[%h]\033[00m%}

    It lacks lots of '%{'. This is the reason it wraps badly. I
haven't the time to test where the lacking '%{' must go. I've put all
them at the beginning and it doesn't wrap bad.

    For every '%}' must be an opening '%{', and you must see the
rules (see the manual) for places in the PROMPT where you can and
cannot change the cursor position.

    Good luck ;))
