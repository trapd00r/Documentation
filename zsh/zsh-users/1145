[I'm reading from zsh-3.1.2, but I think this is the same in 3.0.5]

Look at the zshparam manpage.  cdpath and CDPATH are linked in the same way as 
path and PATH.  typeset -U may also be relevant: it tells zsh to keep only the 
first element of identical copies, and comments that this also works with 
special variables like PATH and CDPATH.

Note that there's a typo in the description: should be "For arrays keep only 
the first element of each duplication.", not "...duplications".  I think, 
anyway, perhaps there's a better way to phrase it.
