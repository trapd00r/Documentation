That should be fine.

} But I don't know if this is correct, because if I put, in .zshenv:
} 
}       export FPATH=fpath+=(~/.zfunc)

No, FPATH is a colon-delimited list of strings which is created by
contactenating the elements of the fpath array.  The above either
will choke with "unknown file attribute" or, if you've somehow
disabled globbing, store the useless string "fpath+=(~/.zfunc)" in 
both FPATH and fpath.
