You can actually use the flexibility of the style system and the
_generic widget to do this.

zle -C complete-file complete-word _generic
zstyle ':completion:complete-file::::' completer _files
bindkey '^xF' complete-file

This defines a new widget called "complete-word".  The completer style
in the appropriate context is set to _files, so when invoked it simply
completes file names.  Then it's bound to \C-xF.

There are infinite variations on this.  If you have "From Bash to Zsh",
see pages 405 to 407.
