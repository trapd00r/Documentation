Without digging into it:

I just upgraded from 3.1.6 to 3.1.9 (making use of the FreeBSD's ports
collection). Initializing completion with:

% autoload -U compinit
% compinstall

puts the following into my .zshrc:

# The following lines were added by compinstall
_compdir=/usr/local/share/zsh/functions
[[ -z $fpath[(r)$_compdir] ]] && fpath=($fpath $_compdir)
autoload -U compinit
compinit
compconf completer=_complete:_correct:_approximate
# End of lines added by compinstall

Trying it out

% cd <TAB>
compgen:12: no such builtin: compgen

Did the completion initialization change without me noticing?
