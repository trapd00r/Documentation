Hi all,

I just found out about the new(?) compsys rehash and wondered
when it was introduced so I could replace/amend my own
rehash blurb in my .zshrc.

Thus, I wanted to suggest that all _new_ docs that ware written
have a term like '(introduced in x.y.z)' appended to them.
It would not be much work and build up, over time. If this is
done, I will probably go through the entries lacking that info on
an idle weekend so the old entries get up on par.


Richard
