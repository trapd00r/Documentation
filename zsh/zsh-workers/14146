} Is this OK? 

No, it's not OK.  Standard question:

Did you remove your config.cache and re-run ./Util/preconfig and configure
before compiling?  There were a lot of changes to configure.in recently.

If that doesn't seem to be the problem, let's have a look at your config.h
and config.modules after running configure.
