So let me ask, what am I doing wrong that makes me believe that I don't
want it in my case?  Is there a conventional way of passing arguments to
an action helper function and not getting them mixed up with arguments
intended for compadd?  Is there functionality I'm missing because I'm
not doing the conventional thing?

That may be the case; I still might have expected some comments on
style, missing functionality (like I'm not passing anything to compadd ;-)
or things completely unrelated to bitkeeper.

I'll send that out later today.

As do I (I actually use it primarily; I hardly touch bk), so I do have a
version of _sccs that uses _sccsfiles.  It's not completely useless.  :)
