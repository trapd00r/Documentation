    Hi Ronald :)

    Try this:

    #!/bin/zsh
    cat << EOD
    EOD

    If you still get the error, then the problem is in the "cat" line
(which I assume from the error output and line number) and in some
interaction with RC files.

    Then the problem is probably not on those files but on /etc/zsh*
ones.

    First let's take a look at the /etc/zsh* files. If you source
them explictly in your first example, does it still work?

    Can you install a new version of zsh locally (in your home) and
run it to reproduce the error?
