It's high time we fixed this properly.  The whole problem with the
completion system is arbitrary bits getting added without understanding the
existing bits, and each time that happens it gets worse.

Both Bart and I have been bamboozled by the networks of special cases and
clever features in _path_files, but we need to track them down if we want
to make file completion maintainable.
