I've got no objection to this (assuming, of course, it actually does what I
think, I haven't actually tried ity et).  It's a little foolerproof than
the previous version.... while we're waiting for the back port to VMS.  As
Alexandre says, I don't think you had any business assuming it *would*
ignore slashes with the old version; I certainly never knew.

(Maybe we could even make a version for VM/CMS where the string `191' is
special...)
