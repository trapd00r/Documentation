Subject: zsh handling of non-standard if-evaluations
To: zsh-users@sunsite.dk
MIME-Version: 1.0

Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Hi all,

on a system with a couple of proprietary applications I noticed that
the scripts provided with the applications contain a non-standard
if-evaluations that seems to work under bash (default shell on those
systems) but not under zsh. Do you see worth to mimic bash here? The
offending case is:

if [ "$VAR" == "VAL" ]

i.e., a double "==" instead of plain "=". This is with zsh-4.2.6.

Thanks.
