Well, easy if you know ich1 means TCINS :).

I stared at it for a while, but nothing of interest happened. I did
test it though, and it works.


I am asking this only out of curiosity, how come updates on the first
line are done like this
write(10, " \343\201\276\343\201\276\343\201\276\343\201\276\343\201\276\33=
[10D",
21) =3D 21
while updates on the second line (ie after wrapping everything) are
done shorter, like this
write(10, "\33[@ \33[10C \33[11D", 15)  =3D 15
? (when inserting spaces in front of our five friends)

Also noticed this didn't seem to be documented. I usually have special
set to bold, but when looking at strace output in the first mail i did
unset zle_highlight and noticed this. (what i should have done was
zle_highlight=3D(none) ).
