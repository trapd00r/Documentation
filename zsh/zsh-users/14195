} Ideally it should append an underscore instead.

When calling compadd, pass the -S option and possibly the -r option.
There is a partial example under the -r option description in the
manual.  For your specific case, probably you want:

    compadd -S _ -r '_ \t\n' ...

(replacing "..." with other options and potential matches, etc.)
