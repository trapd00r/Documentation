 "zsh handling of non-standard if-evaluations" (Jan 27,  4:59am)

} if-evaluations that seems to work under bash (default shell on those

} if [ "$VAR" == "VAL" ]

My guess is:

schaefer[501] [ "$VAR" == "VAL" ]; echo $?
zsh: = not found
schaefer[502] setopt no_equals
schaefer[503] [ "$VAR" == "VAL" ]; echo $?

If you're going to run bash scripts through zsh, you need to run them
with "emulate sh" in effect.
