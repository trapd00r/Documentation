I am not sure if it is releated but I recently found that using some shell
functions in xterm window on Mandrake cooker kills this window. It was funny
to see xterm disappearing after 'prompt -p bart' :-) It may be related to
some signal handling/job control. The Mandrake distro corresponds to
4.0.1-pre-5.
