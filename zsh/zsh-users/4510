Subject: field splitting behavior
From: Paul Lew - remove nospam when reply <paullew@nospam.cisco.com>
X-Mailer: VM 6.99 under Emacs 21.1.1

Take a look at the following:

> var='foo:bar' 
> echo ${(@)${(s/:/)var}[1]}
foo

> var='foobar'
> echo ${(@)${(s/:/)var}[1]}
f

So why it did field splitting on each character when there is no
separator ':' found?  I would expect 'foobar' on the output.

Thanks in advance..
