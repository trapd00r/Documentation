I managed to build zsh on Haiku without too much trouble, I just had to =
add libnetwork for sockets, cf. attached diff.

make test seems to have some issues still, but less than I remember on =
BeOS:

There seem to be a problem with terminfo, didn't investigate.
Also, we are working out multibyte stuff so some issues should be fixed =
soon.
