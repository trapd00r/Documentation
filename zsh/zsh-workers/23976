Probably something like

zcurses -A window +standout

with +/- to enable and disable options which correspond to attributes
that we can either parse out of the header or hardcode as { A_STANDOUT,
"standout"} etc.

zcurses -C window black/red

(for black on red, obviously---I prefer it with the / since unlike with
a space it's obvious what the foreground is) to which similar arguments
apply.

We need to think about any modifications we might want to "read" to make
this more useful.
