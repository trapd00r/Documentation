Well, zsh-4.3.9-dev-3 is there now. 4.3.9-dev-2 and -1 are not, but it
seems the cvs repo is lacking those symbolic names, too (at least 'cvs
log' does not mention them) - so I guess that's fine.

The non-linearity of the repository didn't vanish after I pulled. I
did a re-clone after that and now I cannot find it anymore... So
I guess my previous repo was broken for some reason. So, sorry for the
noise.

Regards, Frank
