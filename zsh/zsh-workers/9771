Subject: Oh no, parameter expansion


Remember our fight to get arrays in nested parameter expansions right?
I just found another on of those:

  % a=(aaa b c)
  % echo ${(M)a[1,1]:#aaa}
  3

That's because $a[1,1] gives a string instead of an array. We could
remove the `a == b' in params.c:1160 to avoid that, but I don't know
what this would break.

And one more:

  % a=::: b=_foo
  % echo ${a/::/:${b#_}:}
  :::

It works with $b[2,-1], haven't investigated any further.

Bye
 Sven
