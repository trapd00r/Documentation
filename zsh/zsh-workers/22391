In case anyone else is interested in this, the original intent of the
bzr shell-complete subcmd was to output completion info for each
subcmd.  For example:

% bzr s-c add
--no-recurse
--dry-run
--verbose
file*

There was supposed to be some rewrite of the options parsing code to
allow shell-complete to output instead of 'file*', either a line that
could be passed directly to _arguments or something that could be
transformed easily.

Finishing this might be a fun project for someone who uses bzr and can
stand Python.
