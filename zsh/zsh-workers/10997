I hesitate to reply, since I seem to be missing something, but as far as
I'm concerned, zsh 3.1.7 just uses straightforward character range
comparisons (not POSIX collation) with ordinary ranges such as [A-Z], but
uses whatever the system tells it with special classes such as [[:upper:]]
(this comes straight from ctype, not the zsh type macros), and this has
been the case for the past couple of versions.  Does anyone have evidence
to the contrary?  Barring a new option, is that the best default behaviour?
Does anyone want an option POSIX_RANGES to restore full POSIX behaviour,
despite the drawbacks?
