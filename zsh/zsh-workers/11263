} My patch seems to be rejected to see that there's no discussion about
} dvorak layout and my patch, and 3.1.7-pre-3 does't reflect my patch.

My apologies; I meant to repond to your message and have not yet.

So I will now.

I've made noises in the now-distant past about making spell-checking
customizable after the manner of the new completion system.  (See 2407
and 4577 for examples.)  We ended up doing approximation in completion
entirely independently of spell-checking.

However, I still think it'd be useful to put a hook in spckword() for
e.g. calling to a user-defined function that could perform whatever
corrections the user likes.  This would be preferable to adding yet
another option, I think.

Now, as I type, this arrives from PWS:

My only objection is above.

} though I'm not really sure how much you gain by examining the keyboard
} layout anyway.

It's used to disambiguate so as to offer only a single correction.  You
don't gain much when alternatives could result from missed keys in more
than one direction, which does happen occasionally.
