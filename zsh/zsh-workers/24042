} This has broken the prompt_opts	feature of promptinit

I think that's a bug in the way those options are initialized, then,
or in "emulate".

Even with -R, options "describing the interactive environment" are
not supposed to be reset, and without -L "only those options likely
to cause portability problems in scripts and functions are altered."

Would someone explain how promptcr, promptsubst and promptpercent
"cause portability problems in scripts and functions"?
