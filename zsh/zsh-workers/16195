Cool.  I just put it there.

One other potential change:  Should readhistline() return "start"
instead of "0" when fgets() fails?  Having fgets() fail with a non-0
start value doesn't look like a very common scenario (because of the
feof() calls), but if we've got some characters in the string, I figure
we might as well return them.  Do you agree?
