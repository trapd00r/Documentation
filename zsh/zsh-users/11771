==============

it's not intended to. what it's good at is not wiping out a file that 
already exists. it will let you screw up, to a certain degree, but it will 
mostly guide you towards making screw ups that can be easily recovered 
from.

the real danger with an alias like this (rm="rm -i" is another one), once 
you start getting used to having a safety net, you forget that it's not 
there sometimes... like using xargs or a different login.
