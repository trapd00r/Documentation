You have to activate compsys (by calling "compinit" from your ~/.zshrc) in 
order to use it; the default is compctl.

Once activated, compsys can be told to fall back on compctl for anything
that it's not able to handle, but there is no way to have compctl tried
first and then fall back on compsys.

(I believe the compsys fallback to compctl happens without any need for
special intervention, that is, you have to set a style to turn it _off_.
The style name is "use-compctl".)

I suspect that means you've not called "compinit".

	autoload -U compinit
	compinit
