Thanks again that did the trick.  

As for my other problem, I looked at the .zshrc for a while and noticed that
there is a command called setopt.  So, I put the following
line in my .zshrc file:

setopt winntconvertbackslash

This did not solve the problem of the back slashes in window's environment
variable.

Instead of using the $HOMEDRIVE$HOMEPATH, I just specify as the path
explicitly.  So now, I just have the following line in my
.zprofile:

export MY_OUTPUT_DIR=e:/jobs/$USERNAME  (since $USERNAME contains on
backslashes, I avoid the problem entirely)

It would be nice to have this resolve in case I have to actually use the
window's environment variable which contains backslashes.

Thanks again for all your help,
Timothy

	In order for the .zprofile to be read, it hss to be a login shell.
	Try invoking zsh with a -l argument and see if that helps.
