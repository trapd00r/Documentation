I forgot to say: somehow I think the way this is handled now is
connected to the problem with default completions.  My thoughts are
very fuzzy, though.  For values and redirections we now have a (what I
consider) clean way to give default completions.  I know that the
my-accounts thing is on a different level, but does it have to be?

Does anyone have the same feeling?  Any ideas?


Bye
