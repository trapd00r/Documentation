There are no particularly sizeable changes this week, but anyone using the
new completion functions is well advised to copy the latest ones.


pws: 5780: Completion/Base/_brace_parameter change

Sven (reposted by Bart): 5783: zerr() sets errflag even if noerrs is set

Sven: 5795: parsing change for assignment and arrays in nested
substitution.

Sven: 5796: globcomplete shouldn't always turn on menucompletion

pws: 5797: set CLOBBERS_TYPEAHEAD for Irix; old config.guess change for
Reliant UNIX and Apple Rhapsody re-imported from old config.guess.

Sven: 5800: _path_files; path altered when no possible match

Sven: 5804: _pdf

Sven: 5811: put back _multi_parts which got left out when it was moved into
Core.

Sven: 5818: parameter name in subscript which looks math-like; _subscript.

Sven: 5829: clear the completion list in more zle functions

Sven: 5830: in ${#:-stuff}, stuff is treated as a single word (unless split
for some other reason).

Sven: 5831: in subscripts and math environments, the whole string is always
passed down to the function handler.

pws: 5844: don't set errflag if noerrs = 2.

Sven: 5852: warnings about _long_options

pws: 5854: man page dependencies in Doc/Makefile.in

Sven: 5862: _path_files (turning on menu) and _cd (include . in path)
