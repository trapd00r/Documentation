Further investigation seems to indicate that the problem lies in it
stat'ing all those "fake" files, and some of those stats are taking a
very long time.  Is there some way to have it not do that?  I guess I
really need a "fake-directories" style so it can not stat them, but
assume the automounts are directories.

thanks,
Greg
