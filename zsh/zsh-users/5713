I think the latter would be a better fix.  It could run at quite a high
level of protection --- unlike normal email, with a mailing list you
can tell if your mail didn't make it.  (In the event of subject lines
like `Zsh problem with pictures of celebrities taking human growth
hormone', or whatever.)

We don't really want to make zsh-workers a closed list, since that's
where we receive bug reports, and this way we can discuss them live
instead of trawling through a list.  This has proved a very useful way
of working.

Although it's less crucial, I don't think we want to close zsh-users,
either, since it's annoying to have to subscribe to a list just to ask
one simple query.  The people who bother to ask questions on the list,
even if they're not members, are often the ones who are able to spot
infelicities in the shell or in the documentation.  At a pinch, they
could still post to zsh-workers, I suppose, so this is an option.
