It would not require any extra effort.  There are already several special
parameters which only work if zsh is not invoked as sh/ksh.  These are
ARGC, status, prompt, PROMPT, prompt2, prompt3, prompt4 and argv.  All of
these are just aliases for other parameters.  Adding HISTCHARS would require
one extra line in hashtable.h.
