 "Adding Text to Each Match" (Dec 12, 10:39am)

Try searching for "mutt".  The thread is "globbing with interposition"
from back in April, and the short-and-sweet answer is that mutt doesn't
care whether there's a space between the -a and the file name, so you
can run them together as -afile1 -afile2 etc., which means you can use
brace expansion.  See zsh-users/8707.
