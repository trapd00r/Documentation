We distribute utilities with the shell that make the use of the shell
itself easier, but not utilities that have some other purpose that
happen to be written in the shell language.  A good starting point might
be www.zshwiki.org, which has links for tools written in zsh.

The directory is not special, other than being mentioned in the default
function path.  You need to issue an "autoload" (preferably "autoload
-U") for the function.
