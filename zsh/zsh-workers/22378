The comment is misleading.  The test above fails UNLESS the executable
is a shell script, not IF the executable is a shell script.  I'm not
sure if the comment author meant to imply an extra script around the
Adobe-supplied default script, or if he got his semantics backwards.

} What's happening is that that line is being run as "local" without the
} argument.  Why?

My only guess is that it has something to do with NULLGLOB and the junk
that would get spewed out by $(<$command[$words[1]]) in the event that
it really was reading directly from a binary executable.
