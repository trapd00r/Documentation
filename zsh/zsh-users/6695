I almost mentioned the -match functions, but decided not to because the
manual section for them has no examples of the corresponding styles.

Why does this need extendedglob?

I'm a little puzzled by that comment.  This is delete-whole-word, not
kill-whole-word, so there shouldn't be any expectation of yanking ...
and in fact when I try it I can't yank the word that was deleted.

It's clear from kill-word-match that BUFFER edits are not automatically
propagated to CUTBUFFER.  Which makes sense ...
