} When compiling zsh on my PC (which runs SuSE Linux 6.1). I got errors
} relating to RLIM_NLIMITS being undefined.

This is a known incompatibility of newer Linux kernel headers with older
glibc headers.  It's fixed by a newer version of glibc; I think the
autoconf people are aware of it.

I've already got mention of it in the Etc/MACHINES file for 3.0.8.  Here's
the snippet:

+       Some versions of glibc2 have a conflict with <asm/resource.h>
+       which causes a redefinition warning on RLIM_INFINITY.  This
+       causes configure to decide that <sys/resource.h> is not present,
+       which can cause compilation errors in zsh's rlimit code.  The
+       best solution is to edit config.h after running configure and
+       #define HAS_SYS_RESOURCE_H.
