Well, *I* do use the new completion system, but the one who found the
problem (tries zsh because I showed him what it can do) doesn't (yet?).

Uhm. Bad.

Is there a test whether or not a module is loaded?
Something like
  =20
    if (load_module("zsh/zle") || is_loaded_module("zsh/zle"))
       load_module("zsh/compctl");

If there is no such function (I don't have any insight in zsh's source)
perhaps now is the time to implement one :-)

Other possible solution: load zsh/compctl if there's a bindkey in .z* -
but that's of course not very intuitive.
