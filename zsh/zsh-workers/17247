I managed to show it with

 % zsh -f            
 % autoload -U compinit   
 % compinit -d
 % zstyle ':completion:*' format 'Completing %d'
 % zstyle ':completion:*' menu select=long select=5

and menu selection followed by interactive completion on a display with
at least two lines.  Maybe it's terminal specific; this is a Solaris
xterm.
