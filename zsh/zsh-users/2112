	two questions:
	
	1) is there some way to force setopt to list the status
of all options?  right now, it only lists the status of those that
have been changed from the shell defaults; if you don't remember the
defaults of all of the options, however, this can cause problems.
if this can't currently be done, can the feature be added?

	2) does zsh not support tracking or exporting of aliases?
