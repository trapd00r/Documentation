just got 3.0pre1 and found that there's still no change to watch.c:

if someone logs out then i'm not really interested in the current
time, rather the time they logged out. but getlogtime only goes
back in wtmp to the time that [uw]tmp was last checked.

one solution would be to ignore getlogtime and have it just
return u->ut_time but i've got a feeling that there was a reason
for verifying the log-out time in wtmp. so the alternative is:

*** watch.c     Fri Jun 28 15:43:51 1996
--- watch_ajs.c Mon Jul  8 15:08:07 1996
***************
*** 61,67 ****
            fclose(in);
            return time(NULL);
        }
!       if (uu.ut_time < lastwatch || !srchlimit--) {
            fclose(in);
            return time(NULL);
        }
--- 61,67 ----
            fclose(in);
            return time(NULL);
        }
!       if (!srchlimit--) {
            fclose(in);
            return time(NULL);
        }

comments ??
