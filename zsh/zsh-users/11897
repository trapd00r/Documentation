The completion system will complete according to the expanded
text of the alias. Here, it will complete a rsync command using
the _rsync completion function.

Above it doesn't work as you'd expect because of the "--" that
seems to confuse the completion widget.


So it would seem to be a bug in the _rsync completion function.


If you ommit the "--", it seems to work OK.

Cheers,
Stéphane
