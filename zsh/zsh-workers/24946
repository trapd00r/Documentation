I tried it without any highlighting.

That's probably doable in principle by tying the highlighting state to
what came in with the prompt, but (i) I don't have a lot of interest in
doing this since it's quite a complicated way of propagating a hack to
get particular effects that's getting hackier as the highlighting code
develops (ii) as I said, it doesn't seem to work very well anyway.

It ought to be (but might turn out not to be) fairly easy to add a
"default" element to zle_highlight that causes the given attributes to
be used as the default set for the command line, which would probably
work a lot better, and then deprecate any reliance on what the prompt
happened to produce.
