Hadn't thought of them... I'd suggest doing this with another
`ZLE_'-flag.

Let's see:

- beginning-of-buffer-or-history
- beginning-of-line-hist
- down-history
- down-line-or-history
- down-line-or-search
- end-of-buffer-or-history
- end-of-line-hist
- get-line (?)
- infer-next-history
- kill-buffer
- kill-line
- push-input
- push-line
- push-line-or-edit
- run-help
- up-history
- up-line-or-history
- up-line-or-search
- vi-down-line-or-history
- vi-fetch-history
- vi-history-search-backward
- vi-history-search-forward
- vi-open-line-above
- vi-open-line-below
- vi-repeat-search
- vi-rev-repeat-search
- vi-up-line-or-history

Some of them should clear the list only if the history is used. Some
of them already clear the list, and some of those who already clear
the list have not been mentioned.

Any other suggestions?

Bye
 Sven
