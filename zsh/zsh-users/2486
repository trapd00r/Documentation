Subject: expandig var values at the command line
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

I tcsh I use to have a variable set to a list of directories:

set dirs = '{dir1,dir2,dir3,...,dirN}'

then I would do:

ls /path/path/$dirs/path

and I would get the contents of those directories.

I can't get similar behavior in zsh.
It is expanding the variable once, and treating its content as a single
string
instead of expanding to the names of each directory.

Any idea how I can get that to work?

Thanks.
