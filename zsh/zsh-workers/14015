Subject: Small oneliner to fix warnings

Here is a small oneliner to fix a warning when building zsh on ia64.
The warning:

terminfo.c:69: warning: cast to pointer from integer of different size
terminfo.c:168: warning: cast to pointer from integer of different size

And the obvious patch:

--- zsh-4.0.1-pre-3/Src/Modules/terminfo.c
+++ zsh-4.0.1-pre-3/Src/Modules/terminfo.c  2001/04/15 20:00:42

Thanks,
