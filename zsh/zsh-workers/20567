It looks like SIGPOLL is standardised, though from X/Open rather than
Posix, while SIGIO isn't (although it has a long history, too).  So I've
made it prefer SIGPOLL to SIGIO.  This doesn't actually change anything
on Linux.

I'm working on something to allow variants on input.  This is easy
enough for kill, the real killer is function-style traps.
