I've seen this since 3.0.4 at least.

Building zsh with the stock cc from NeXT (adapted from gcc) I cannot use

if [[ -s /some/file ]]

because it does not recognize the file as being equal to zero.

Building it with gcc (2.7.2.2) works.

The NeXT version is based on 2.5.8.

I think Rhapsody will use a newer-based version of CC.
