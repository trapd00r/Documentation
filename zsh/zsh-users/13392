The reason it displays like that is that it shows the default state.
You're obviously in ksh emulation, where it seems singlelinezle is on by
default.  We're probably shooting ourselves in the foot over this; as I
said, it's only superficially like ksh, and it's not clear this is
really an emulation of it in a helpful sense.  Any other opinions?

Anyway, "unsetopt singlelinezle" is probably what you want.
