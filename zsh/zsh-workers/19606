Please take a look at my tla completion at
http://www.people.iup.edu/bclg/zsh-completion--tla-1.1.tar.gz . It's
probably horrendous from a Z-Shell expert's point of view, and it's for
tla 1.1, but it is pretty complete and offers completion for most tla
arguments, including archive and library revisions, configs, and
patch-logs.
