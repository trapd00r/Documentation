Using zsh 2.5.0, with options including the following:

setopt autolist
setopt correct      
setopt correctall

I have just deleted my netscape lock file and found to my surprise:


> [4]> rm ~/.netscape/lock
> zsh: correct `~/.netscape/lock' to `/home/mjs/.netscape/lock' [nyae]? y
> [5]>

This is odd, as my home directory is /home/mjs and therefore no
correction is necessary.  The netscape lock file seems to be a bit odd
in that it links to a non-existant file.  Similarly, the following
sequence of commands:

[63]> cd
[64]> ln -sf 1.2.3.4 abcd
[65]> rm ~/abcd
zsh: correct `~/abcd' to `/home/mjs/abcd' [nyae]? y
[66]> 

one of those weird things I guess!

Mike
