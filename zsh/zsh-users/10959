Subject: An improved "hosts" completion handling
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1; format=flowed
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Content-Disposition: inline

I had been using some code I'd seen "out there" to pull known_hosts as
a way of setting up a $hosts value so that ssh/telnet could do tab
completion on host names.

I think this was the source, more or less...
http://www.2701.org/archive/200405030000.html

With the changes in openssh, of late, ~/.ssh/known_hosts is now
littered with encoded host names that were getting pulled in such that
I'd get tab completion looking like the following:

cbbrowne@dba2:~/Slony-I/slony1-HEAD-pristine> ssh rg  ssh
rg570-da-logdbs
  Wednesday 17:20:40
rg570-da-logdbs

Bleah.  That's awful.

The following showed an alternative that does some better parsing, as
well as reading IP addresses.

http://www.zsh.org/mla/workers/2006/msg00280.html

Here's my adaption of this:

for file in $HOME/.ssh/known_hosts /etc/ssh/known_hosts; do
  if [[ -r ${file} ]] ; then
    _cache_hosts+=(${${${(u)${(f)"$(<${file})"}%%[
,|#]*}:#(#s)[0-9]##.[0-9]##.[0-9]##.[0-9]##(#e)}:#(#s)[0-9a-f:]##(#e)})
  fi
done
zstyle ':completion:*:hosts' hosts $_cache_hosts

Hope that is of assistance to others...
