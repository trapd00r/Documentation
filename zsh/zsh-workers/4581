Is this a feature?  I don't like it, if it is.  

Suppose I have a few commands like foo_baa, or foo.baa, but I can
never remember what case the baa is supposed to be.

I think it would be cool to be able to use case insensitive globbing
even on the command word.  It certainly feels ugly to have a special
case like this.  

I can see why you might want special cases for builtin bits of syntax
like if, while, etc., I suppose (just to avoid all that time-wasting
whitespace), but it still feels ugly.
