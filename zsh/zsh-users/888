Yes: /tmp isn't a pattern. Try for instance: ls -d /tm[p] /blah*
It won't complain.

Note that:

1) tcsh will also complain if you write: ls -d /tmp /blah*

2) If you wanted to regard /tmp as a pattern, it would be difficult to
decide what is a pattern and what isn't. If /tmp were a pattern, -d
should also be a pattern, as zsh cannot guess which arguments will be
regarded as filenames (it depends on the command).


Now, there's something I don't like:

$ ls -d /tmp() /blah
$ ls
zsh: no such file or directory: /blah
$ whence -ac ls
ls: aliased to \ls -bF --color=tty
ls () {
        /blah
}
/home/vlefevre/bin-sparc/ls
...

(-bF, --color=tty, -d and /tmp functions are created too.)
