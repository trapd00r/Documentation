} Why does $'...' not expand inside "..."?

Because it doesn't in any of the shells that introduced it before
zsh had it.

I believe the reasoning is that double-quote is allowed to appear
inside $'...' and to expand $'...' inside double-quotes creates a
parsing conflict.  "How does this $'with " embeded' parse?"

} It's not, as far as I can tell, mentioned in the documentation.

The documentation for zsh tends to omit things that are assumed
knowledge, particularly when a concept or feature originates from
another source -- because if you didn't already know about it from
the original source, why did you even think to use it?

This is an acknowledged shortcoming that is addressed piecemeal.
