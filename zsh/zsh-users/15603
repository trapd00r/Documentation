} This looks like an interesting application. I just started playing

} somewhere that goes over some use-cases, shows examples, etc.

Well, the original zsh-users article from the first version is:

http://www.zsh.org/mla/users/2008/msg00043.html

And that discussion started with the very first message of 2008:

http://www.zsh.org/mla/users/2008/msg00000.html

Which led to this suggestion of using the zsh history as temporary
memory for taking quick notes:

http://www.zsh.org/mla/users/2008/msg00023.html

There aren't a whole lot of use-cases in there, but it gives background
for where the app came from.
