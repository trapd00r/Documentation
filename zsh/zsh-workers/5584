Subject: pws-10 +  completion broken ?

Hi,
I've just install pws-10 plus patches upto 5579.

Now the (simplest) completion seems broken.

Assume there is a file  ChangeLog

typing

cat Chan<Tab>
just clears the command line.

Have I missed something?

Here the options I am using (since ages)

setopt CDABLEVARS CORRECT HIST_IGNORE_SPACE HIST_VERIFY
setopt IGNORE_EOF PATH_DIRS AUTO_MENU ALWAYS_TO_END AUTO_PARAM_KEYS
setopt  COMPLETE_IN_WORD MAGIC_EQUAL_SUBST PUSHD_SILENT EXTENDED_GLOB


Thanks for a hint,
Helmut.
