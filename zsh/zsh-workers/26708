This is reponse to Sourceforge issue 1968395: failures to create hard
links aren't gracefully handled.  Failing to create a link because the
file already exists is the normal condition being handled by the locking
code; however, a failure for any other reason is presumably a hard
failure worthy of reporting.  The same goes if stat() fails with
anything other than ENOENT: in both cases we give up and should say so.

It's possible this can be improved further.
