Thanks to you all for the help.  It's remarkable how painless the
transition has been so far; everything just works.  I expected a lot
more gotchas in the process of swapping out something as fundamental
as a login shell.  Kudos to the developers.  :-)

Now, I'm hoping to sort out the difference in backgrounded jobs.
Specifically I can't say "sync & exit" anymore, or "startx & exit"
either.  Is this what "&!" is for?  I tried "nohup startx & exit"
yesterday and that seemed to just instantly kill the startx process.

I also need a little administrative help; are there any procmail users
on the list, and what do you use to tame zsh-users?  Here's what I've
come up with so far:

   # zsh-users
   #
   :0
   * 1^0 ^TO_zsh\-users
   * 1^0 ^Delivered\-To:.*zsh\-users
   * 1^0 ^Newsgroups:.*comp\.shells\.zsh
   {
     LOG="zsh-users - "
     :0:
     IN.zsh-users
   }
