My opinion is that pdksh is somewhat buggy when it comes to job handling, and
that you are better off trying to emulate David Korn's ksh93 than the buggy
pdksh; other better examples are dash and bash.  I already quoted the parts of
POSIX that mention that subshells inherit the same options as the parent (so the
pdksh behavior of silently disabling -m in a subshell violates that rule).
