zsh tends to be a bit more lenient with this sort of thing anyway.
Here, the ";" unambiguously indicates the end of a command line, which
just happens to be empty.  I'm not completely sure it's a bug.  Compare,
for example, the behaviour of "for f in ; do; done".  It's quite useful
that this simply does nothing.  (Whether it's valid according to the
various standards is another matter.)

It looks safer the way it is.
