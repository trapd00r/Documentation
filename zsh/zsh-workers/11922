Yes, that would be preferable.  Does `evaluated' mean `treated as a string
to be passed directly to eval' or `split into words and executed' or
`parsed and executed as a command line'?  I think it could be clearer.
`$reply' would be more standard, but it doesn't really mean much here; I
wish there were something more obvious, but I bet we've discussed that.
