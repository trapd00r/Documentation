|   Hello,
|   
|   	I'm using zsh 3.0.0 on Linux, and I have some problems with
|   it.  When I issue a CTRL-C at the shell prompt, zsh quits and returns
|   to the login prompt when I'm at the console, and close the xterm
|   window when under X.  I compiled the same zsh on Solaris, and I have
|   no such problems.
|   
|   	Is there a cure for this ?
|   
|   	...David
|   
|   PS: stats:  Linux 2.0.20/Redhat 3.0.4 distribution
|   	    Solaris 2.5 running on UltraSPARC 140 machine.


	It's been a long while, but I remember a similar problem.
	Pay close attention to wether your defining any if not all
	your signals in signals.{c,h}. I remember fudging something
	in the configuration or makefile.

	Hoping this is a pointer,
	-Hank
