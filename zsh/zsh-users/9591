    Hi zzapper :)

    Mmm, difficult to say... Probably <ESC>-<ESC>, which I have bound
to "kill-buffer", to clean the command line when I have "running
fingers" and screw it badly XDD

    My ^Q (push-line-or-edit) is very useful for me, too.

    Really, the entire Zle thing is superb. If it were a library...
But nobody is perfect (Zle is *almost* perfect, then).  ;)))
