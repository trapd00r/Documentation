Hi.

	Recently I have tried using OpenVMS. So far I pretty much like
everything there.
	One thing that I liked specifically about it is that it completes
commands automatically if there is only one match.
	For example - if I want to purge all the previous versions of all files
in the directory, instead of typing 'PURGE' I can type 'PU' because
there is no any other command that starts with PU, so it knows that I'm
talking about the command PURGE:

$ pu	<- here the command went out fine
$ p 	<- here it says that there are other commands that start with p
%DCL-W-ABVERB, ambiguous command verb - supply more characters
 \P\

I wish you could tell me if it is possible to do with ZSH, because this
feature is simply one of OpenVMS' best features.
