It needn't be too hard.  Consider fvwm2 and Perl; both use loadable
modules to excellent effect.  In particular, Perl's extension system
is easy to use and very powerful.

That said, I would consider it important to put all /bin/sh behavior
in the base executable.  Otherwise you could end up with a seriously
broken system and no way to recover.

Ditto.
