Personally I prefer to keep the unexpanded form for history purposes 
(next time the glob might match different files).

To output the names beforehand, you can make a function:

diff () { echo "Diffing: $@" >&2 ; command diff "$@" }

The 'command' precommand modifier prevents 'diff' from referring again 
to the 'function' of the same name.
