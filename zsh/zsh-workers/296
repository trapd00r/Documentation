I installed the new zsh 2.6-beta10 on a Linux PC running kernel version
1.3.15. Its jobcontrol does not seem to work (even if the configure
program set JOB_CONTROL to 1).

I compiled the shell with gcc 2.7.0 (using a.out binaries). The problem show
for example by starting ftp and pressing Ctrl-Z. The program stops, but zsh
does not show prompt. The ftp shows as traced on ps:

 1515 pp3 T     0:00 ftp
 1519 pp4 S     0:00 zsh

The process 1519 is run under zsh 2.4.306 beta and the 1519 under 2.6-beta9
(but 10 works similary).

If I try "ftp&", the zsh crashes.

The problem might be with Linux, since 2.6-beta10 works fine on SunOS 4.1.3.
