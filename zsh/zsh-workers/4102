} The bug was the chain of events in between, not the EOF's.  (Or am I
} missing the point?)

The point is that zsh is interpreting a read(2) that gets SIGINT'd as
having reached EOF.  That doesn't affect the behavior as long as it
ignores the EOF for other reasons, but it feels like a bug waiting to
happen.
