Package: zsh
Version: 4.0.2-2
Severity: normal

When I type "while do done", zsh loops without reacting to signals
like Ctrl-c, Ctrl-\, kill -TERM. No problem with "while :; do
done". The man page says

       while list do list done

and list might be empty, so this should be valid syntax.

I just noticed it returns immediately if $? happens to be non-zero. I
think it should always loop infinitely. In any case, it should be
interruptable.
