} Hm. I'll try to look out for this.

} In which way do you want this to differ from what beggining-of-history
} and end-of-history do in menu selection?

Er, sorry, I want them to work exactly like begining-of-history and
end-of-history; problem is that begining-of-history and end-of-history
don't do anything.  When I type those keys, nothing happens except that
the listing redraws itself -- I don't leave menu-selection, but the
selected item doesn't change.  Wait, that's not quite true -- when I
have two columns, ESC-< moves to the left column and ESC-> moves to
the right column, but it never moves up and down.  Maybe this is
related to the other bug.
