I'm not sure what use people put the --program-suffix option to; it's
possibly they expect to be able to rename the files to the base programme
and have everything work, in which case zshall.1 would need to be the
way it is.  But if it's usually used the way you do, then certainly
the naming in zshall is wrong.
