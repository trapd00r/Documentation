Subject: restoring the RPROMPT broken?
Message-ID: <20030224172213.GA18105@binome.blorf.net>
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Disposition: inline
User-Agent: Mutt/1.4i

I've noticed that in 4.1.0-dev-6 that when the RPROMPT vanishes (due
to the typing of a long command), it does not pop back into existence
when there is room to redraw it (due to the shortening of the command).
In 4.0.6 it comes back without having to press return.

I don't think this was an intentional change, was it?  I don't see
anything about it in the ChangeLog file.
