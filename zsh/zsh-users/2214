Subject: redirecting stdio/stderr from a suspended then bged job

This has been bugging me for a while.  How can I suspend a job that is
taking longer than I expect and then put it in the background and then
redirect stdio and/or stderr to a file (or /dev/null) ?

example:

wget http://slowserver/bigfile.tgz

1% done and its been 2 minutes

^Z

zsh: 25317 suspended  wget http://slowserver/bigfile.tgz

bg %1 >/dev/null 2>&1

nope does not work that just redirects the output of bg not the job that
was bged.

Any suggestions? (besides using screen).
