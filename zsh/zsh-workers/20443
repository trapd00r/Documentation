Yes, I agree with all of that... however, rewriting the whole thing not
to require NULL-terminated strings is quite a big change (there's no
"memncmp" function, for example, and I'm not sure if you can guarantee
memcmp will stop comparing soon enough).  Only a few of the nasty
negative pattern matches need to rejig the string, so it would probably
make the vast majority of matches a bit slower.  I'll put it on the list
to look at.
