(Note there's another similar case statement further down in another
function.  I know because I missed it on a previous attempt.)

Doesn't this run the risk of duplicate case labels?  This is the problem
that caused this fuss in the first place.  We can't rely on the compiler
being able to handle them gracefully (I don't know what the C standard
says, but the statement seems to hold in any case).
