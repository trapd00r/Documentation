	similar problems for about a year in my .zshrc, which prints a welcome 
message parsing the output of `uname -n`; this is running 3.1.4 zsh on solaris 
2.5.1, and 3.0.5 on solaris 2.6.
	it seems like everyone is having problems only during the sourcing of 
startup files.  has anyone had this happen during an interactive shell, after 
startup?
