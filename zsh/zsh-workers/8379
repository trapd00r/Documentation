Subject: "typeset -x" vs. "export" in 3.1.6
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Consider the following two functions:

putenv() { typeset -x $1=$2 }
setenv() { export $1=$2 }

Is it really intentional that they don't have the same behavior?  (They
have the same behavior in every version from 2.5 through 3.0.7, though I
can't say for other stages in the 3.1 chain.)

This is a pretty serious incompatible change.
