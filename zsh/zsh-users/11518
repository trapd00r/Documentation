This kinda works:

hardstatus string '%{= mK}%-Lw%{= KW}%50>%n%f* %h%{= mK}%+Lw%< %{=
kG}%-=%D %d %M %Y %c:%s%{-}'

Basically what that does is have the hardstatus that Mikael was
defining in the little panel at the bottom, but only if you switch to
that panel.  Now I imagine that you could change it so that instead of
showing it down there, it would show it in the xterm status by using
the escapes for that.  I'll look into that some more and post that to
if I get time for it.
