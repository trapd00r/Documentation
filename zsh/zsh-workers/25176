I completely disagree. ~/.zshenv is useful to define environment
variables when the first zsh shell isn't always a login shell, in
which case ~/.zprofile isn't read (e.g. when the user's main shell
is not zsh and zsh is executed from that shell, or when one uses
ssh + command; the user shouldn't be forced to use the -l flag).
This is also better than the ~/.zprofile when the user often
changes his config files and doesn't want to logout and login
again (meaning quitting the X session...).

Moreover ~/.zshenv is useful to define things that are not exported,
such as shell variables, named directories and so on, that can also
be used in non-interactive shells.
