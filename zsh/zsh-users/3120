That would be cool if I could get it to work.  However, no matter
what I try, tab does not expand wildcards with expand-or-complete
set.  It just expands $VARIABLES.

The only thing I get when I do that is this error:

    _expand_word:5: curcontext: parameter not set

This is caused by my predilection to having the "no_unset" option set
for my interactive-shell use.  Seems like this should get turned off
when the shell runs some completion/expansion code.  Do we have an
existing solution for such things?

When I "setopt unset", then the <C-x e> binding is quite handy.  If I
could just re-introduce those old changes to have it stop expanding
tildes, I'd be quite happy.
