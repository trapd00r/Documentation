I think you're probably right, but it's not completely clear.  The page
you quote explicitly says:

EXIT STATUS

     0
        All name operands were successfully unset.
    >0
        At least one name could not be unset.

Now, if it doesn't exist, it can't be unset, but I think by `unset' they
mean `rendered such that it is not set whether or not it was before',
which is your interpretation.

It doesn't cause the shell to abort currently.  The terminology in the
introduction does suggest `error' is more or less synonymous with
`non-zero return code', but I can find no normative indication of
whether this applies to the language used for the special builtins.

Probably someone should request a clarification.
