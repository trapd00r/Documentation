Okay, finally encountered a real example of this being annoying now.
% scp file lt<tab>
---- file
lth/
---- remote host name
lth

tabbing to the remote host name gives me
% scp file lth:
Now how do i complete files on the remote end? If i press tab again i just get
% scp file lth/
And if i type a : i get
% scp file lth::
the only way that works is typing something and backspacing, then
pressing tab again...
