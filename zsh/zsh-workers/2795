Somebody here tried something like:

#!/bin/zsh -f    
#            ^^^^empty spaces added here
echo your code here

and got back:

/bin/zsh: bad option: -

This is a problem because, once again, previous versions of zsh
weren't so fussy.  (For comparison, ksh reacts similarly but you get
`-f     : bad option(s)' which is at least a little clearer.)  This
happens on IRIX, SunOS 4, AIX and Digital Unix 4.0, though apparently
not on Solaris.

I would think dropping meaningless spaces in an option string
(i.e. when an option letter is expected) again would be harmless.  I
just want to wait for the waves of protest before trying anything.
