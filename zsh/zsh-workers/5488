The first try with pretty vanilla shell (no options set). Simply copied
Functions/Competion/* to ~/.zsh/completion

itsrm1% zsh
/home/bor/.zsh/completion/init: no matches found:
/home/bor/.zsh/completion/_*~*~ [165]

~/.zshrc:

#!/tools/bin/zsh

fpath=( $fpath ~/.zsh/completion )
[[ -f ~/.zsh/completion/init ]] && source ~/.zsh/completion/init
PS1='%S%n@%m:%~%#>%s '

If extendedglob is set, this work :-)
