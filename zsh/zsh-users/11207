Lydgate,

shell script expressions != regex expressions.  The expression up there
would match:

00
01
02
03abc

but not:

1
2
3

However, I will give you that your expression would work fine in a regex
engine...

There is a ZSH extension that would have more of the effect you are
looking for but its as unportable as most other solutions,
unfortunately.
