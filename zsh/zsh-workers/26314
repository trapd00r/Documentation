It can't be quite that simple.

% prompt_THEME_precmd() { print Executing function; }  
% precmd_functions=(prompt_THEME_precmd)
Executing function

Do you mean something different?  For example, do you mean "doesn't get
automatically added to precmd_functions"?  That also seems to be working
for me.

Can you reproduce this starting from "zsh -f"?
