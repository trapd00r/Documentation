The only things copyrighted by Tom are the option descriptions in
{commands,options}.zsh. I'm not sure they're really copyrightable, but I
gave him credit anyway. He didn't directly contribute anything
otherwise. Most of the functions in completions.zsh have work from Erik
Toubro Nielsen, and some of those in commands.zsh have work from him and
Rob Weir. Looking at my files, I see my attributions are a bit sloppy ;-)

> Are you going to do an update for tla 1.2?

I have no plans to for the time being, simply because the 1.1 version
works pretty well with 1.2. The only changes needed should be to update
the commands which have changed or been added.
