Yes, I didn't think about the '-f' bit and */* matching anything with a
slash in it when I took the completion out the manual. I don't
understand what you mean by the last sentence. I think the answer is
that it does work correctly.

I don't think that the -D flag would be better. I would then have to
program the alternative '~' expansion in for every command. Also, the -T
flags operates when completing the command itself if I run a command in
a user's directory.

I meant that there might be a problem with my new compctl not with zsh
itself. I don't think there is though. I was thinking that there might
be some other respect where my compctl would interfere with some other
intended completion to give undesired results as I found to be the case
for the original compctl which is an example in the manual. 

Another compctl problem I've had is with a compctl I'm trying to
construct for lynx based on one I have working under tcsh:

The following does not work as I would expect:
compctl -x 's[file:/]' -/g '*.html' -W '/' -- lynx

The problem seems to occur with the slash character as this does work
as expected (although it doesn't do anything useful):
compctl -x 's[file:]' -/g '*.html' -W '/' -- lynx

(As does 's[file:]' -S/ -s '`pwd`' which is the useful completion 
of 'file:' only).
