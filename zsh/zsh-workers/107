Fine I can wait...... Would this allow for the zsh script to call for
more that one interactive sessions? or to continue executing after
the exec?  Surely if I do 

		exec < /dev/tty

and the user types control-D then the shell will exit.

Your message makes me realise that instead of the 2 schemes Ive
already suggested for source I should just check if the specifed file
is a terminal (using isatty) and if it is go 'interactive'. This
is an easy modification.

			Anthony.
