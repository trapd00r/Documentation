No you're certainly not. Life on NT would be almost unbearable without
Amol's Zsh port and other great progs like Vim.

I'd love to have the XFree86 xterm as the console window. It's probably
been ported under cygwin32 but running an Xserver just to get a decent
console window seems a bit OTT.

BTW, you can get scrollback (if I understand your terminology properly).
Properties->Layout->Screen buffer size does the trick. Cut and paste
works too but it is incredibly fiddly as you need to muck about with
the menu.
