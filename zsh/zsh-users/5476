Appeal to whomever runs this list....

I know this has been hashed out repeatedly in the past, but this is
getting ridiculous. While I like this list, the volume of spam / viruses
I get from it exceeds the actual list traffic.

Could you either

a) Close the list to non-subscribers
b) Use a confirmation system like TMDA for non-subscribers and / or
moderate the list.
c) Do some sort of filtering to reduce the number of viruses / spam
messages that go through to the list.
