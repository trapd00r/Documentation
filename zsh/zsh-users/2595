At first I thought you'd found a bug in the math parser, but:

} export min=3D$3;export max=3D$4;
}         if (($[min]<10 &&=A0$[max]<10)) then
                           ^^
There's a metafied space here.  I think zsh is interpreting "\240$[max]" =
as
an identifier; e.g. if max=3D11, the identifier name is "\240\061\061".  =
That
identifier isn't defined, so it's value is 0 which is always < 10.

} 	        for i in {${min}..${max}}; do echo $i; done
}         fi

This is a danger of permitting identifiers to contain non-ascii character=
s.
