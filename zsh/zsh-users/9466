I'm just guessing here, but something like this has happened to me before:
I logged in my "regular" user, and my custom functions worked...
then I used su to become root... and my custom functions stopped working.

Turns out that I forgot that su doesn't source my shell files,
sourcing them manually worked, and su - worked as well.

Mentioning it just in case :)
