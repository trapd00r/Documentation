You could iterate over ${(k)parameters} and check for [[ $dir == *ROOT &&
$dir != CVSROOT ]].

grep should be the best choice there. You can of course use read
instead and then check each line, but I guess that would be a lot
slower.
Same goes for grep | sed | tr - When it comes to operating on streams,
I found these to be far more efficient than the zsh builtins (which
usually operate on single values and need to be wrapped into read or
similar).
