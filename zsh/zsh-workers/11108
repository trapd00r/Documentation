It looks good to me. I'm quite happy with a deep hierarchy - I prefer it when directory listings don't scroll up endlessly.

I prefer 'Core' to those as they might be wrongly associated with the UNIX kernel/system by anyone first seeing them. I would be more inclined to use 'Base' and then rename the directory which would have been 'Base' in Core.

I agree with Bart here. I'm not convinced by the idea of using capitalised first letters for all the directories. It looks especially strange with things like 'Bsd' and 'Aix'.

Please not 'Flavor'. I think it is better to avoid any words which have different spellings in America and Britain if at all possible.

How about 'Entity'?

It would be useful to be able to check out previous releases in the future so if the repository is going to be hacked then it would be better to try to leave things so that a 3.1.7 can be checked out in the future. Either by making the changes before 3.1.7 (the CVS doesn't go back to 3.1.6 does it?) or is it possible to just copy the RCS files (instead of mv) and clear out some of the tags from the copies so the old RCS files are still there but we have the history in the new ones. Of course it wouldn't be the first time if I'm talking complete crap about CVS so ignore me if I am.

While we're on the subject of cvs can people be a little careful with the ChangeLog - I've fixed it a couple of times when the merge has gone wrong. For an example, do:
cvs diff -r 1.183 -r 1.184 ChangeLog
An update before a commit might make it less likely?

I'm not convinced that the example startup files have much value anymore as they are quite out of date. I have added a section for startup files to the contributed part of the web pages and I think it would be better to point people to there if they want examples and to remove those in the distribution. This might also reduce the chances of people mistaking them for example global startup files (I'll add a note to the web page to clarify that they are example user startup files). If anyone wants to contribute their startup files, I'll add them. I've already linked to Adam's.
