Ha!!  I started using zsh about a year ago (3.1.4) and I have to say
it has been the most reliable free software I've ever used... let
alone for a BETA.  By comparison, when I decided to switch to a Bourne 
style shell from tcsh, I first went to BASH (2.02) which is supposed
to be a stable release.  Within about 2 days I'd found at least ten
ways to crash it hard, was disgusted, and switched to zsh at the
recommendation of a few xemacs-beta list members.  It's the only
worthy shell in MHO.

Keep up the excellent work!

Greg
