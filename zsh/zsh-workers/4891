I wanted to leave the previous behavior unchanged as much as
possible. The `-T' is the only case where multiple compctl's were
tested in all other cases making -t<whatever> implicit would make
things differ from the way it was before my patches.
So we could make -tc implicit for -T (at least the `global' -tc,
before any -x). That would make things behave like they always did but 
I didn't like to add special cases at that time.
Anyway before I change anything I would like to hear a bit more what
people would like to have, ok?

Bye
 Sven
