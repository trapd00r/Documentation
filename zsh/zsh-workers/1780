I've mostly rewritten most of the thing related to traps which fixed all of
these bugs you describe above.  Sorry for the duplicate work.  In pre4
traps defined by trap and TRAPxxx functions will be different.  trap will
be POSIX compatible.  It will not define any function and it executes the
trap in the current environment.  TRAPxxx functions will work as before.
Also traps set by trap will be unset in a subshell as required by POSIX but
this does not affect the TRAPxxx functions.  This is only done with
explicit subshells and with backgrounded commands, so trap | less still
works (in bash/ksh trap | less shows nothing).  This is legal since POSIX
does not tell wether a pipe element should be executed in a subshell or in
the current shell environment.  In fact I've already put together pre4 and
put in onto the ftp site yesterday.  Then I went home and I wanted to post
the announcement with my modem but then I discovered a bug in this new trap
implementation ...  So even if you see pre4 on an ftp site, do not download
it, it is not the final version.  The final pre4 will be ready within a few
hours.
