Try IFS=$'\t'
Then "${var[*]}" will be joined with spaces. It's the same in
every Bourne-like shell but the Bourne shell (and earlier Almquist
shells)

$ IFS=$'\t'
$ set a b
$ echo "$*" | cat -t
a^Ib
$ a=(a b)
$ echo "${a[*]}" | cat -t
a^Ib

Actually, with zsh (and zsh only) $array is the same as
${array[*]}, so:

$ echo "$a" | cat -t
a^Ib
