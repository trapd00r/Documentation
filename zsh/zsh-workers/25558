Thanks, with some additional trickery, that did it. With the given
information, I could almost reverse engineer the location in the manpage
where this is written :). _wanted says it has some options in common
with _requested, which in turn hints you might find some information
in the _description text, which does explain what -V does. I am still
somewhat confused about what the difference is between -V, -1V and
-2V though.

The following diff is not submitted in any way, but only to illustrate
the needed changes.
