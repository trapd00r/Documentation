At the least it demonstrates a potential problem with different shells using
the same parameter name for what may be differently-formatted data.

What does the content of ~/.sh_history look like?  What's the file size?

It's also possible that it's the setting of HISTSIZE and/or SAVEHIST that
are actually the problem.  Are those parameters set?
