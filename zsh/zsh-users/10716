} openssl base64 doesn't handle utf8 encoded content.

That sentence *shouldn't* make any sense.  The input to base64 encoding
is a raw byte stream, and the output is ascii.  Conversely, the input
to base64 decoding is ascii, and the output is raw bytes.  Any other
encoding shouldn't enter into the process at all.

In what sense does "handle utf8" matter?
