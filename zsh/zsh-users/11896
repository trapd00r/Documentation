If the shell were to behave like that, that would mean that in

cmd

if [ "$?" -ge 2 ]; ...

The test above would be useless because of the empty line above
that would have reset $? to 0.

What you could do is redefine the accept-line widget (called
upon <Return> key press) so that it runs the null command (":")
if the edit buffer is empty:

~$ accept-line() {
function> [[ -n $BUFFER ]] || BUFFER=:
function> zle .accept-line
function> }
~$ zle -N accept-line
~$ false
(1)~$ :
~$ :

But why do you want to reset $? in such a way?
