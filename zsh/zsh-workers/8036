In pws-5 with (I think) all the patches applied, I'm seeing an extra
menu on accept-and-menu-complete with old-style completion.

    zsh -f
    zion% bindkey '^X\t' accept-and-menu-complete
    zion% setopt noalwayslastprompt
    zion% echo $ZSH_<TAB>
    ZSH_NAME     ZSH_VERSION

pressing another TAB gives me:
    zion% echo $ZSH_NAME                ; and then ^X-TAB yields:
    zion% echo $ZSH_NAME $ZSH_VERSION
    ZSH_NAME     ZSH_VERSION
    zion% echo $ZSH_NAME $ZSH_VERSION

So, another menu appears when it shouldn't.

This was working fine in plain old pws-5, I believe.
