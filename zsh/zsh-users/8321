I don't suspect this is possible, but I thought I'd ask.

Is there any way for zsh to set the background color of my terminal 
program?

I'm often logged into to 3 different computers (ssh), and it would be 
handy to be able to quickly look for the color of one to know that it 
was the one where I was connected to X
