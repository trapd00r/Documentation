If you only want to see the matching files together with the
directories, use only one `-g' and apend the `*(-/)' to the `*.(tar|...)'
with a space betwen them.

If you want to see `foo.tar' and `bar/snafu.tar' as completions at the
same time, you would have to write a completion function and make it
be called `compctl -K'. There you could use `**/*.(tar|...)'. But I
doubt that you really want that, because of the possibility of
accidentally making it scan great parts of your directory structure.

Or maybe I didn't really understand what you want?

Bye
 Sven
