} I think you can't break out of `read' with ^Z.  Try it without the cat|
} and you'll find you can't suspend the loop.

Does anyone have any insights on this?  I was about to announce 3.0.8,
but discovered that this loop is not suspendable there either.  I don't
have much time for debugging it myself this week ...

If it doesn't appear to be easily fixed, I'm going to go ahead and put
3.0.8 out anyway.
