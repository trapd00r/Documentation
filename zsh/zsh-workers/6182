One thing I haven't mentioned before:  because of the way I update the
distribution version, it's very easy for me to forget to add brand new
files, so keep watch for this.  Updating existing files is more easily
automated.

Sorry I didn't get around to looking at the SIGWINCH version horrors, but
it was a very good weekend, and I was clambering over cliffs in Liguria
(along with the rest of northern Italy).

Here are the changes


Geoff: 6104: multi-line prompt fix (6101 backed off)

Sven: 6105: _make patch whitespace

Bart: 6106: short documentation fixes in expn.yo, options.yo, redirect.yo

Sven: 6109: completion in parameter assignment should set context `value'

Sven: 6113: compadd -D, nuke element in an array for each failed match

Sven: 6117: position of ignored suffix in inserted match

pws: 6118: _closequote and _oldlist completers

Sven: 6119: don't insert word separator before ignored suffix

Sven: 6121: try harder with braces after a parameter expansion

Sven: 6124: menu completion wasn't consistent between tabs

Sven: 6128: completion after an expansion; list after a non-completion list

Sven: 6129: comments for struct cadata

Ville Herva: 6131, see 6126: reset tv.tv_sec before select for Linux

Sven: 6132: compctl.mdd

Sven: 6133: autoloaded parameters

Sven: 6150: alwayslastprompt sometimes failed in M-x

Sven: 6152: compstate[vared]

Sven: 6153: realparamtab to smooth access to autoloaded parameters

Bart: 6162: autoloadable parameter code links without dynamic loading

pws: 6165: globsubst'd foo='~/bin' depended on extendedglob being set

Sven: 6167: show unloaded parameters as undefined

Bart: 6171 as rewritten in 6174: old RedHat Linux doesn't have normal
definitions for poll.

pws: 6180: Completion/Core/compinstall
