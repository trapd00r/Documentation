Subject: compctl "-y" argument busted in 4.0.6

Hi again,

Still upgrading from 3.1.6... the following demonstrates 
that compctl "-y" is broken in 4.0.6:

% setopt autolist noautomenu nolistbeep listambiguous listtypes
% compctl -k "(foo bar baz)" -y "(FOO BAR BAZ)" foobar       
% foobar <TAB>

displays no completions at all!

If I type "f" then <TAB> it does complete correctly.

thanks,
Greg
