Subject: predict-on is no longer completing?
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

The history completion part of predict-on is still working, but it's also
supposed to attempt standard completion when the history search fails.

The problem appears to be that there aren't any completers for the context
containing ":predict:".

+_main_complete:61> zstyle -a :completion:::predict:: completer tmp
+_main_complete:62> set --
+_main_complete:67> _completers=( )
+_main_complete:68> _completers_left=( )

Was that an intentional change, or should the default list of completers
have been used, as I expected?
