I think the interpretation should be that "/" searches the `natural'
direction (whatever that is) and "?" searches the reverse of that.
With that interpretation, the previous behavoir is more natural.  As
Bart said, you rarely ever want to search forward (down) the history.
The `natural' direction is always to search up the history.
