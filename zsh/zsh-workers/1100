I meant that for the lexer it is simpler to treat null as non-blank.  The bug
was there but my latest patch fixed it I hope.

I do not think so.  Neither bash nor ksh93 does this.  Look:

% ksh
$ count () { echo $# ; }
$ IFS=/
$ count as/df/gh
1

SH_WORD_SPLIT only changes the result of substitutions.
