this can be made simpler.  eg. i read and post to this list via
gmane.org, which is a NNTP/mailing-list gateway.  using the simple
fact that no spammer ever uses a real from-address, posters to a list
get a message from "your friendly authorizer" on gmane which they
have to answer to.  then held posts go through.
