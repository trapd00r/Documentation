I find this explanation a little confusing.  Is it possible to get back
from recursive-edit without doing an accept-line, thereby requiring an
additional accept-line to restore the display?  In which case it would
take three actions (getting out of recursive-edit, restoring the display,
and then accepting) to accept the line?

If not, I'd reword thus:

-On return from both widgets, the display is restored by any zle command
+The display is restored (and the widget returns) upon any zle command
