I'm not able to reproduce your problem.  I get coloring in both cases.  
Are you _sure_ zsh/complist is loaded?  Are you sure you have ZLS_COLORS 
set properly?

The shell functions in compsys don't do anything magical.  They just read 
a value from a style and assign that to ZLS_COLORS, then restore the old
ZLS_COLORS value after finishing.
