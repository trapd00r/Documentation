Hmm...  No responses yet.  Is there anyway I can I provide more
information?

If I hit Control-x and h to see the completion context for a username
that's attached only to hosts in the users-hosts style, this is what I
get:

$ ssh user3@<C-x>h
tags in context :completion::complete:ssh::
    argument-1 options  (_arguments _ssh)
tags in context :completion::complete:ssh:argument-1:
    hosts  (_ssh) 
    hosts  (_hosts _combination _ssh_hosts _ssh) 
    hosts  (_ssh_hosts  _ssh    _normal)

It seems to me that _combination should be the only item listed, but I'm
not well-versed in completion.
