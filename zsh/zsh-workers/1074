Dear zsh-maintainer & hackers,

I think I've found a problem starting with 2.6-beta14:

zsh% - zsh-2.6-beta13
zsh-2.6-beta13% ls =(ls ..) =(ls .)
/tmp/zsha03289  /tmp/zshb03289
zsh-2.6-beta13% exit
zsh% - zsh-2.6.beta14
zsh-2.6-beta14% ls =(ls ..) =(ls .)
/tmp/zshb03330  /tmp/zshb03330
        ^
	| wrong file name

This does not happen if the second command (`ls .') is changed to have
no argument (`ls').

Thanks to all the hackers for all the improvements.

Yours,

Martin
