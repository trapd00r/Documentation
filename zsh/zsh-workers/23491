Hrm.  I'm ambivalent about this patch.  The {fd}< syntax is one of the
things that gets tested for correctness quite a bit later on.  If it
doesn't work properly here, could the whole test suite fail?

That is, I'm wondering if the implementation of the test suite should
restrict itself to the most basic shell operations possible and only
the tests themselves employ extended functionality.  There's a reason
e.g. we don't attempt completion tests until after we've tested module
loading ...

However, I won't make a fuss if no one else cares.
