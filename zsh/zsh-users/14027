Thanks for your suggestion, but that does not work either. It will
complete the leading ``00:'' part, but then it stops. Pressing <Tab>
again after that won't bring up the completion menu, as zsh does for my
other completions, even if I manually enter a `0' or `1' to distinguish
the both available arguments.


Greetings,
Frank
