I noticed zsh 3.0.3 is on the FTP servers and has been for a couple
days, but I didn't see an announcement of it on the mailing lists.  I
can't find mention of one via the archive server either, so I don't
think I missed it.  The README file says 3.0.3 is the latest
production release of zsh, but I'm confused because usually an
announcement is sent around the very same time a release is made.
