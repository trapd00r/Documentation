So you're worrying about the case where multiple shells have started,
discovered that there's no .zshrc, and are all waiting for user input?

No, I don't think there's an easy way round; you'd have to trap that in
the function.  They could sleep waiting for input and checking for
.zshrc, I suppose, but that's a bit messy.
