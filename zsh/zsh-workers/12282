Why is this messing with your preferences?  It's only setting a
default which each user can override, surely?

Again, I must be missing something because I don't see why you
describe this as messing with /your/ fpath when at that stage you (the
user) haven't made any changes to it.  You are still free to set it to
whatever you want, aren't you?  The only possible problem I can
envisage is that something gets autoloaded which you didn't want to
be, but if you didn't want it autoloaded, you won't be using it
anyway.  What am I missing?

I wanted to err on the side of convenience.  If those directories
exist, the likelihood is that they contain stuff which the user will
want to use.  If they don't, they don't get included.  What's the
harm?

Yep, this is a remnant from old code.

I'm curious now.  Why?

Just another default, surely?

I have a nasty feeling I've missed a key point here.
