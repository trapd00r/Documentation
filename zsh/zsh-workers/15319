Subject: propagate LDFLAGS to modules - howto?

Hi,

I've configured current zsh (on my IRIX-6.5 box) with
LDFLAGS='-s -L/usr/LOCAL/lib -rpath=/usr/LOCAL/lib'
since my libpcre.so is there.

But when executing pcregrep (having loaded it before
without any error message)
I get an rld error showing that /usr/LOCAL/lib
is not in the list of searched directories.

How can I pass this information to the Makefile
building libpcre ?

Thanks for a hint,
