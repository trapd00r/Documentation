Here's the problem.  @RLIMITS_INC_H@ is being replaced by /dev/null; I
suspect the mod time of /dev/null changes whenever it's written-to, so
it's almost always newer than rlimits.h -- hence rlimits.h is remade,
and so rlimits.o is also remade.

Please re-run configure and let me know whether you see the message

    RLIMIT MACROS NOT FOUND:  please report to developers

There's a comment in configure.in:

dnl rlimits.h only appears in dependencies if we are actually using it.

I suspect that comment may date from before rlimits.o was a module, and
is now incorrect -- or else it refers to the system <rlimits.h> rather
than to the generated file "Builtins/rlimits.h".
