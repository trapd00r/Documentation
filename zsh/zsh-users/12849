Hi all,

I just wrote some completions for awk, cut, join, and sort. I was
surprised that zsh didn't include these already. The awk one isn't
perfect but it's a lot better than nothing. The awk one only completes
basic POSIX awk options (i.e. not gawk or mawk options) while cut, join,
and sort completions are for the GNU versions.

I find these helpful, particularly because these commands all use
different flags ("-F", "-t", and "-d") to do the exact same thing, even
though these commands will often appear in the same pipeline! awk often
trips me up in other ways, and this completion really helps with that
too.

Two questions:

1) where can I post these? Should I mail them to this list? I didn't see
an obvious place to post these on the zsh wiki.

2) who should I send them to so they get into the next zsh release?

Thanks,
Omari
