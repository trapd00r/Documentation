} to recompile Completion.zwc.

That must be it.  Works for me:

zsh% sed -i<TAB>
Completing suffix for backup
Completing option
--in-place  -- edit files in place
zsh% sed -i <TAB>
Completing sed script
zsh% sed -i s/x/y/ <TAB>
Completing input file

} To be sure : i've used zsh Completion.zwc Completion/**/_*(^/)

I don't know what that means.
