1% mkdir /tmp/testdir /tmp/otherdir
2% touch /tmp/testdir/foobin
3% chmod 755 !$
4% zsh

A/1% PATH=/tmp/testdir
A/2% fo<TAB>
(will offer foobin as a completion, and hash it)

or

B/1% PATH=/tmp/otherdir/../testdir
B/2% fo<TAB>
(will not offer foobin, and not hash it)


In contrast, bin_whence likes it just fine.

C/1% PATH=/tmp/otherdir/../testdir
C/2% which foobin
/tmp/otherdir/../testdir/foobin
C/3% hash -L
hash foobin=/tmp/otherdir/../testdir/foobin


Why the inconsistency?
