One other thing that is now borke is if I do any command substitution in
the startup scripts (to set a variable say) after I have set the SAVEHIST
and HISTFILE variables, and I don't have APPEND_HISTORY set, then this wipes
out the history file as well.  (But I guess that this should make sense if
exec is wiping out the history file under these same conditions.)
