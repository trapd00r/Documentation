    Probably. In the first place, I'm not using "compsys" completion
(for giving it a name...) but "compctl", and I don't have
description lines on top of the completion list.

    The only think I'm inheriting from my /etc/zshenv is PS1, but
I've tested even without it and the problem is the same. With an
empty PS1 the crash is much more difficult to have, and I even doubt
I got any crash at all with an empty PS1 last time I tested Bart's
patches :????
