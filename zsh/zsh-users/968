Hi,

I think someone asked about this before; A friend of mine has left Uni
and got a job; he is now without a UNIX machine to plat with and has to
put up with DOS & Win95.

I recall that someone else asked if zsh has been ported to run on a
Win95/NT machine; Please can you tell me where to get it from?

Thanks in advance,

Wez.
