} One way to deal with that would be to output some
} characters other than spaces that would only become visible when zsh
} makes a partial line visible.

What happens when THOSE characters cause the line to wrap?  You don't
know how many RI to emit (COLUMNS-7 is definitely wrong in your
example).  You can only do this right if you manage to do it with a
single character.

} I made the text bold too (if possible) and switched to using print
} with prompt expansion.

I was going to suggest that.  Perhaps '%B%S$%s%b' would do it, as long
as the user doesn't have promptsubst set; hrm.
