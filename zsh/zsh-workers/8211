} I cannot apply this patch. It creates lots of files in top-level directory.

} non-POSIX mode patch selects file name with the least number of slashes.
} And in POSIX mode it won't create files.

Run the "cvs diff" output through this:

	sed -e '/^RCS/,/^---/d' -e '/^\+\+\+/d'

That will strip all file name lines other than the Index: line, forcing the
patch to apply correctly in non-POSIX mode, and it should work for both
context and unified diffs.
