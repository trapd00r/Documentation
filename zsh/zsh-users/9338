Ahh, it wasn't clear you wanted the create-time.  In Unix (and any
sufficiently Unix-like operating system) the "ctime" for a file is the
last time there was a change to the file's inode and is generally
portable.  Not all Unixes keep track of the create-time for a file, so
any mechanism to retrieve it is almost certainly non-portable.
