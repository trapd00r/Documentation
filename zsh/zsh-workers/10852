Yes, function moving and ordering before 4.0...

The directories we have now have mostly historical reasons and several 
functions could sensibly be moved in other directories even now.

What I would like is a more logical ordering. I haven't really thought 
about this yet, but maybe a Core with some of the functions it
contains now, a directory with functions like _arguments (not really
generating completions, only helping to add them), one directory with
all those functions that generate a certain type of matches (options,
jobs, pids, file-descriptors, etc.). And then certainly one for the
builtin commands.

The other stuff is harder to decide. _rpm, for example can also be
useful on non-Linux systems. I don't know debian, but I guess the
commands from that directory can be useful elsewhere, too. So maybe we 
should package the functions in a way that reflects what the commands
do (network, package-managers, ...).

I'd like to hear suggestions about all this. (And now Andrej comes and 
says that we should put all the GNU commands on the side... which
wouldn't work with the ordering-by-what-they-do, of course. I still
think there should be only one function per command and we try to find 
out what to complete by investigating the environment inside the
functions.)


Bye
 Sven
