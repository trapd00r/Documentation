Down to 870 lines in zle_tricky.c :-(.  I've got another problem, because
I'm using Zoli's patch for dynamically loading on AIX, which renames
refresh to zrefresh, but that only accounts for an extra 300 lines or so.
(Also I need patch -R, but that's trivial.)

I did notice one thing: the functions rembslash() and quotename() live
in zle_tricky.c but are called in compctl.c.  This is bad because they're
in different libraries; common code should be in comp1.c.  (Quite a lot
of the widget completion patch was simply trying to get round the use
of different libraries.) If you move them you have to move instring as well.
