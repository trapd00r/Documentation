That's because Sven said `if the tag alias changes make it', and I assume
he was talking about the latest set which he didn't want in yet.  If those
appear next time (and I expect they will), this will be added too.

10179, which was an attempt to fix something which apparently didn't have
any effect.  I will take advice on whether to apply it or not.

Sort of; I applied the first version by hand because of the problem that
made the quoted-printable version necessary.  (My father is a retired
lawyer.)

Whoops, that's because I'm not compiling in the SVR4 environment.  Sorry,
I've applied Bart's update.
