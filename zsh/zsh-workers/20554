Thanks!

I did not think of that at all.

All completions under Completion/Darwin/Command except _fink seems to 
be Mac OS X specific. Those commands use Mac OS X specific libraries. I 
don't know whether Fink supports Darwin. It seems there are no reason 
Fink doesn't work on Darwin, although I don't know well about Fink.

Completions under Completion/Darwin/Type should work on Darwin, but I 
don't think they are useful without Mac OS X, since they complete 
applications for Mac OS X or files used by applications for Mac OS X.
