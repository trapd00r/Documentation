Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Content-Disposition: inline

I'm not sure if this is supposed to work or not,
print $(eval "echo -n '\\U'{1..200}")
outputs the first 200 codepoints on stdout more or less correctly,
print -z $(eval "echo -n '\\U'{1..200}")
only pushes up until 3 characters after 'y' to the editing stack.
