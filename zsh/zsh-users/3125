Hi all,

generally i am quite exited about the zsh.
there is one feature that i really would like to have:
colored completion.
(I love colored completion when i hit ls<tab>.
 i want it with other completions , too , not only
 when i try to complete filenames .
thats why i would
love to have colored completion programmable.)
any thoughts about that?


otherwise i hope the near future can provide that :)
(whoever the future might be ... :) )
