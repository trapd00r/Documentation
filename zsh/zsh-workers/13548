Bart, this was done based of your comments in 9596  :-) My position now is
(after I got closer look at these scripts) that they actually belong to
/etc/zprofile and have to be activated by default, not only for the above
reason. Without them you get somewhat crippled environment (well, you get
Linux but not Mandrake). Do you have any objection?
