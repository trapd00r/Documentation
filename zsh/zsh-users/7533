Timothy:

If you are running a computer with an ip address that changes 
(dynamically allocated), this will work, although it is kind of ugly:

define an alias such as:

alias myip="curl -s http://www.showmyip.com/simple/ | awk '{print $1}'  
"



I would echo the output of myip into something at login rather than 
grab it off the internet every time I hit the return key.


If you have a static ip address, you should only have to figure this 
out once.   On Mac OS X you can find this in the System Preferences 
under file sharing or network settings (I am assuming this on the basis 
of the Micro$oft email stamp at the bottom of your email.)

This alias and a whole bunch of stuff that is useful for OS X zsh is 
distributed by Gary Kerbaugh.  I have links to it and a few of my own 
zsh functions here:  http://tinyurl.com/3373b
