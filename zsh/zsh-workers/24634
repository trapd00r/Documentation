C-x h will show you that in that context it's expecting to complete
files, only.  The _hash function is calling _path_files at that point,
which doesn't know how to populate an incomplete tilde-expansion.

I don't have time at the moment to try to work out what to change to
get it to call _tilde first.  I may take another stab later but if
someone else wants to jump in, please do.
