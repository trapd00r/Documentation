I presume you mean the second statement.  If you've got any evidence
against the first statement I'd like to see it.

I looked a bit further and it seems it's used in gettokstr() to
hungetc() a character when we have an error.  I don't understand what
that buys when we can't parse the input anyway, particularly since we
don't even know if it's a valid character because of the other way of
setting the value; could it have been a hack to get history lines to be
stored properly after an error?  I recall we improved that at some
point, so this hack may not be necessary.

I traced it (the "err = c" thing in dquote_parse()) back in the code to
3.0.0, which is before the use in cmd_or_math() that is causing the
problem, so it wasn't introduced specifically for that, and
cmd_or_math() was roughly the way it now is right back in 3.0.8.
Consequently (although what you say is true) I don't see anything wrong
with the proposed change.
