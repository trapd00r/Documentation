Thanks for the suggestions, but ...

The FAQ was correct without this patch.  $* and "$@" are equivalent in
zsh, unless you run it under Bourne sh or ksh emulation (i.e. with the
SH_WORD_SPLIT option set).

The typo fix appeared in one of my doc patches ... zsh-workers/4118 is
the article ... along with some other clarifications of the surrounding
text.

The semantic flaw is arguable, but in patches of this type please spell
out phrases like "if and only if" rather than using abbreviations with
which some readers of zsh documentation may be unfamiliar.
