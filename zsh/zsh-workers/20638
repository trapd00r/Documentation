it is far from being suitable for commit (and I was off most of the time).

it is more general problem. When match is inserted it has all parts - ignored 
prefix, prefix, etc insterted. In our case we actually have as iprefix 
everything up to separator - and get everything up to separator reinserted. 
It happens without any nested calls too:

{pts/0}% foo foo,TAB
{pts/0}% foo foo,bazzz,
Completing test values
barr   bazzz

and hitting a-a-m-c

{pts/0}% foo foo,bazzz,foo,barr

It is the same problem as completion in braces. Braces are treated as special 
case inside completion code unfortunately. Hopefully it is possile to 
generalize it.
