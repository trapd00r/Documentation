A recently developed problem which I cannot explain.

When I rlogin to my SUN account from my NeXT, I have been "losing"  
output.  Most often it happens with 'ls' or 'cat' where the command  
runs but nothing comes to the screen.  If I feed it to 'less' that  
works.

The NeXT is running NeXTStep 3.3 pl1 and I'm using Stuart.app.

The rlogin connection is over PPP connection (mtu/mru 1500, 28.8  
speed, serial port at 57600)

The Sun machine is running 4.1.4 and zsh 3.0.0

Any clues?
