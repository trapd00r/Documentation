} Why does zrecompile redirect STDERR to /dev/null when running
} zcompile?

Probably to suppress warning-only messages like

	zcompile: functions will use zsh style autoloading

because zrecompile is intended to run unobtrusively from a .zshrc or the
like; but I agree that it would be nice to see more of the *real* failure
messages from zcompile.
