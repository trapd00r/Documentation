} Is it possible to have more than one directory assigned to $HELPDIR 

Not without rewriting the run-help function, but of course you're free
to do that.

} Alternatively, can these helpfiles instead be generated as manpages?

Heh.  The helpfiles are generated *from* the manpages.  You could do as
is done for the bash builtins and make a lot of links to the zshbuiltins
etc. manual pages, but then you don't get the very specific entries that
are normally found by run-help.
