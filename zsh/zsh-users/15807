} As far as I can see, these are all from my .zshrc (the deleted ones and 
} the ones before the "->"):

That would appear to mean that sourcing your .zshrc file is stopping
before reaching the end.  Try something like

# at the top of .zshrc
exec 2> /tmp/zshrc$$
setopt xtrace

# at the bottom of .zshrc
exec 2>&1
setopt noxtrace

See if it ever reaches that last, for one thing.  Either way examine the
trace file to see if your bindkey commands are ever being executed.
