Hi,
	I am trying to learn programming command completion using
	zstyle. After a long read of /usr/share/zsh/functions, I still
	have to idea, not even how to start.

	I have the following two cases to do, can someone please give me
	a hand and tell me how to start??


	lpr -P[TAB] complets to a list a printer name, read from
	/etc/printcap.


	rm -rf completes fine, but sudo rm -rf does not work.


	Thanks for the help.

Shao.
