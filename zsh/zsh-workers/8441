I forgot to say: if they were special parameters we could easily make
one mirror the other (internally they would then really be the same
char**). It's just a (tiny) bit nasty to inherit the value of a normal 
parameter into the special one when complist gets loaded.

But then, we could make complist be autoloaded on `ZLS_COL(|U)RS'. We
had this question when I posted complist, and I was against it, but at 
that time I didn't think about making them special. Hm.

Bye
 Sven
