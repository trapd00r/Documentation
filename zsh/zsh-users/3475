} Is it a bug or what?

I can't reproduce this.  You should probabably `set -x' before running
compinit and look at the trace to see what may be stepping on it.

It may be a side-effect of the zsh/parameter module, which gets loaded by
compinit.  The parameter module "knows" that named directories must begin
with a slash character, and normally doesn't let you assign such values.
This can lead to some oddities like not being able to assign the value of
a parameter to itself:

zagzig% hash -d tex=blah
zagzig% echo ~tex
blah
zagzig% zmodload zsh/parameter
zagzig% echo ~tex             
blah
zagzig% echo ${(kv)nameddirs}
tex blah
zagzig% nameddirs[tex]=$nameddirs[tex] 
zsh: invalid value: blah
zagzig% echo ${(kv)nameddirs}
tex blah

(So nameddirs[tex] wasn't assigned, but it wasn't deleted either.)

However, as you can see from that output, normally loading zsh/parameter
does not affect values that are already in the hash.  There haven't been
any changes to the module since 3.1.9 that would make this different for
3.1.9-dev-7, so I'm at a loss to explain the behavior you described.
