It's possible it's broken; the HP-UX loading stuff always used to be
a bit different.  Nothing much we can do without an HP-UX system,
unfortunately.  I thought they'd made it more like standard dlopen.

This is almost certainly a problem with the pty module.  Again, only
digging around with that on HP-UX will make a difference.
