(Hello, it's nearly 3am here and I'm waiting for my Windows machine to
repair its disk ... if I leave it alone I can't answer the dialogs that it
throws up periodically, and not answering causes it to lock up and have to
be reset, which of course only makes matters worse ...)

OK, that's obviously not ideal ...

Yes, it's pretty obvious that it should work:  parse_subst_str() does
an untokenize() before it lexes the string, so it won't matter if the
string is or is not already tokenized.  All that your patch is doing is
removing an optimization.

Consequently I think it would be OK to include it (possibly with the #if
replaced by an explanatory comment).  It'll slow down expansion of un-
quoted parameters slightly in the name of correctness, a tradeoff I made
several times in my subscript-parsing changes.
