This is suffix removal.  The completion system added a space after the
completed name in case you wanted to type another command argument next,
but instead you typed a "|", so you obviously didn't need the space so
it removed it before adding the "|".  Suffix removal is more useful in
some other cases, such as the removable "/" after completing a directory
name or the removable "}" after completing a variable name inside "${".
