} Yet another reason, is it not, why /bin/sh should be /bin/sh and not

Unfortunately, there's no (?) PD implementation of the pure old-fashioned
Bourne shell that can be distributed with Linux.  It's either pretend, or
don't have a /bin/sh at all, I think.

That said, I'm not entirely sure that the Bourne shell wouldn't also have
choked on that construct.  My guess is it was tested with zsh and ksh,
not with a "real" sh.
