Hi,

On zsh 4.3.9 I found a potential regression on .. completion at least on FreeBSD
(not on linux) don't know about others OSes.

When I do ..<tab> or cd ..<tab> it doesn't complete with / as it did before
(until 4.3.6) or as it does on linux. 
cd ..<tab> doesn't complete anything, 
..<tab> complete with : external command, alias executable file or directory.

I can't find where is the bug, so I can't send any patch.

regards,
Bapt
