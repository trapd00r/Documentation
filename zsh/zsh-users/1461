Hi!

Thanks for feedback, Mark!  :-)

Quoting Mark Borges (mdb@cdc.noaa.gov):
>  $ echo **/*~*.[Gg][Ii][Ff]

ok, but - this just excludes the GIFs.
Now, how do I combine this with the BMPs and JPGs, too?

Can I use '|' for "or"?  Example:

   $ echo **/*~*.[Gg][Ii][Ff]|[bB][mM][pP]|[jJ][pP][gG]

I'd rather be using something like this:

   $ echo **/*~(*.[bmp|gif|jpeg|jpg]/i)

.. where "/i" means "case insensitive".
Is there a way with zsh globbing?

I didn't get this to work, either.
I also seem to get into trouble with
different kinds of regular expressions.
*sigh*
