Okay, but is there a gain in specifying "emulate -R zsh" instead of 
"emulate zsh".

Sorry, but as far as I understood "-f" makes the shell skip everything 
/except/ /etc/zshenv. Many people set options in the other startup 
files so my script should benefit from "-f"... Or would it do more or 
less the same as "emulate zsh" or "emulate -R zsh".
