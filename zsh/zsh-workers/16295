Subject: completion: Some versions of man should complete filenames
Date: Thu, 29 Nov 2001 15:06:12 -0500
From: Peter Whaite <peta@cortexmachina.com>


You can give some versions of man a path to a nroff file..

    man /usr/local/man/man1/zsh.1

It would be useful for completion to handle this case, i.e. complete the
page name as directories and files whenever there is a "/" in it.

My setup...

% echo $ZSH_VERSION
4.1.0-dev-3
% uname -a
Linux aragorn 2.4.14 #1 Sat Nov 10 17:16:26 EST 2001 i686 unknown
% man --v       
man, version 1.5i1
% rpm -qf =man
man-1.5i2-0.7x.5
