} Pardon me if I've missed something, but you aren't really suggesting
} that the number of errors be based on the entire length of the input
} line, are you?  The length of the current _word_, surely?  For file
} names, it should probably only be the length of the path segment that
} actually contains the cursor.

That last sentence applies to completeinword only, of course.  If you're
at the end of a /u/s/l/z/z/s/ path expecting it to expand all the way to
/usr/src/local/zsh/zsh-3.1.5-pws-11/Src/, having the length of the word
determine the number of errors makes sense.

Perhaps the length of the word minus the number of slashes?  Argh.  I'm
thinking about this too hard.
