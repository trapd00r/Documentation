TRAP_RETURN triggers on any non-zero status, while an "always" block
is used to stop actual errors which would usually cause everything in
sight(*) to abort.  If you're really concerned only with non-zero status
and don't care about errors there's every reason to go with something
like TRAP_RETURN.

(*) for some values of "everything"
