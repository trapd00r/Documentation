This is kind of a lame way to do it. Hopefully someone has something
better :)

for word in `cat file`; eval echo $word

I guess you can adapt that to your needs.

Unfortunately, I don't see a parameter expansion flag that performs brace
expansion on the result. It seems like there ought to be one.

Perhaps the "e" flag should also do brace expansion in addition to the
other types of expansion it does. Hmm, there is probably a good reason it
doesn't.
