} Wondered about that, but there are so many possible tweaks to word
} splitting I'm trying to think of a more flexible way than simply two
} letters (that doesn't involve anything as gross as a shell option).

Perhaps leave (z) alone and introduce (Z:stuff:) where stuff can be
a set of controls for how the parse is applied?

Another possibility would be to introduce a builtin ala zparseopts that
dismantles the string and populates a hash, or something.
