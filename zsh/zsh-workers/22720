I started to have it only in current CVS version; cannot say when it started 
to appear as I switched to it only recently.

Press ENTER and quickly type in any character before prompt appears (I have 
extra dcop call to set window title, so it takes some time). It is echoed 
back with extra character added; after that it is correctly shown on next 
line:

{pts/0}% cd
c%                                                                              
{pts/0}% c                                                                    

In this case it is `%'; more over it is inverted (bold?) for some reason, 
while my prompt is not where it should; but that may be konsole issue. Prompt 
is:

{pts/0}% echo $PS1
%B{%y}%#%b

Not fatal but slightly annoying.
