Subject: 64bit Zsh for Solaris?

Hi,
 
I'm looking at using zsh for creating a tool by using the loadable module
facility - it looks great.
 
My problem is that I need a 64 bit version (i.e. compiled to produce a 64
bit binary) for Solaris. I've tried both the Sun compiler (which I would
prefer to use) and the GNU C compiler; zsh compiles fine, but it fails a   
number of the tests in the test suite.
 
The code model we use on Solaris is LP64 (i.e. longs and pointers become 64
bit)
 
The reason I need a 64 bit version is so I can mmap() huge files (i.e. in
the order of > 4 GB)
 
Do you know of anyone that has covered this area before? I don't want to
reinvent the wheel (or make some other stupid mistake).

Thanks,
Greg
