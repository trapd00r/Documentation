Nope, unfortunately this doesn't work either - or rather, it works TOO
well. What happens in that case is that I get the value in PROJ
repeated in front of every value in $PROJ_LIST, so (using my above
example) cdpath turns into

  /root/project/src /root/proj_a/src /root/project/src /root/proj_b/src

Which, as it happens, actually works fine for a cdpath; it's just
redundant and inefficient. (And cdpath gets real huge real quick when
$PROJ_LIST has 10 entries...)

However, THIS works just fine - it returned the functionality I had in
beta1. So far this is the only way I've found to get the behaviour I
want, although Soren sent me mail showing how I could get almost the
same behaviour with rcexpandparam set (it worked with the simple
$ROOT/$PROJ_LIST/src case, and I had to manually prepend
$ROOT/$PROJ/src).

So, thanks... :)  (Hopefully globsubst won't have any other unwanted
side-effects...)
