The normal bzr backend *is* slow. It calls bzr itself twice. Which
takes about half a second on my system, at best. Agonising.

But the use-simple backend really only reads from *one* file. That
should work instantaneous, unless you're on a networked filesystem.

Are the people complaining _sure_ they enabled use-simple correctly?
