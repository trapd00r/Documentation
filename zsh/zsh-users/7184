This is good, thanks for testing... as far as I know zsh compiles
everywhere (for suitable values of `everywhere'), though with a few
remaining zpty problems.  It would be nice to fix those, but it's not a
top priority any more...  I will release 4.2.0 on Friday anyway, unless
something major turns up.
