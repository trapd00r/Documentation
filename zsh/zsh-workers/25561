Consider you got this:
    [alias]
        co = checkout

And try: git co <tab>
...everything looks fine; but then you try: git co -b <tab>
...which should work, too (by displaying a descriptive text:
"branch-name"), but it does not.

The reason for this is too much quoting. This should be the right fix.
