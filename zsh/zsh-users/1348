Hey folks

	As Bart just pointed out, there are many different pieces of zsh  
that even someone who has used the shell for awhile doesn't necessarily know  
about.
	
	I was wondering if there was any interest in getting together a  
'best of Zsh Uses' file.... I'd be happy to put it together.
	
	I'm thinking of nifty little functions and scripts that illustrate  
tricks and just plain good use of the functionality (heh... pun intended) of  
zsh.
	
	Commented code, of course, will be the most easily reusable.... but  
if you can at least give an overview it will be appreciated.
	
	If you're interested, please reply (using this Subject: line) and  
I'll start a summary file).
	
	Thanks!
	
		TjL
