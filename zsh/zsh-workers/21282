Recently, the Debian packages for ksh93, pdksh, and zsh cooperated to
provide alternatives for /bin/ksh.  This was done without defining any
exact requirements, so at the present time, it is de facto "the
intersection of ksh93, pdksh, and zsh".

Unless this bug is deemed release-critical (I doubt it will be), the
upcoming Debian release will allow zsh to easily be /bin/ksh.

P.S., someone left conflict cruft in ChangeLog.
