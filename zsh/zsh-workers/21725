Hi,

I understand that rfc1345 doesn't include the euro sign. Vim chose to use the
digraph =e, and zsh chose the digraph Eu. Otherwise, both use the same
digraphs (and of course, I am using ^K as my zsh compose character). To make my
life easier, I added to my .vimrc the lines

    " zsh compatibility:
    dig Eu 8364     " €

I wonder: Is there no update to rfc1345 which standardize this? I think Eu is
more logical, as a direct analog to the other currency digraphs like Ct, Pd,
Cu and Ye (the range U+00A3 to U+00A5). Of course, the =e has its own mnemonic
value, as an E crossed by two dashes, so it is apparently just a matter of
taste!

Best,

Zvi.
