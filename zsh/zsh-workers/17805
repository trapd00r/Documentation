    Thanks for your answer, Jason, but I don't want to make the
software dependent on 'tar'. In fact I don't have tar on my system! I
use 'pax' instead ;))

    The aim is to depend only on the shell and POSIX utilities (like
'cp', 'rm, etc... you know.). I want to impose little or no
dependencies. 'tar' is not a good solution for me, I prefer 'pax',
although is not as extended by now, 'rsync' seems to big for copying
a few bunch of files, and 'ssh'... well...

    Thanks again.

    Raúl
