Peter Stephenson sent me the following 0.9K:

> This requires EXTENDED_GLOB, unlike the basic "**" syntax.


Ah, I was using ls to test Mikael's suggestion, and it was expanding the
directories, so I was seeing CVS directories though they weren't being
matched.  I needed:

   $ ls -d **/*~*/CVS

However, though this omits the CVS directories themselves, it does
generate CVS/Entries and so on.  Peter's pattern seems to work great.
Thanks!
