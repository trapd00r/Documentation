I don't really believe in the division between basic and extended
functionality, except as regards add-ons; if the shell's broken it needs
fixing.  You're correct that the new syntax isn't used as much so it's
more likely it would get broken without anyone noticing.  I don't see
any implication beyond needing to fix that before running other
tests, however; that can in principle happen with anything.
