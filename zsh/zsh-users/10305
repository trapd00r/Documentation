the result is splitted with IFS. If you want each lines to be an element 
if your array, use (f) flag.

names=(${(f)"$(find  . -print)"})

for f ( $names ) print $f

OT but can help : you don't need find as ** can search files recursively :

names=( **/* ) and names=(${(f)"$(find  . -print)"}) are equivalent
