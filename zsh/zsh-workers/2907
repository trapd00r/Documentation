Well, I hate to disagree with some who's trying to find common ground with 
me, but I think it goes beyond the issue of creating a usable environment 
for new users.  Why should I have to add new cruft to my startup scripts 
everytime a new release comes out?  Why do we have to abandon things which 
are already working?  Why did I have to start using this function for pushd:

pushd () {
        setopt localoptions globsubst
        unsetopt ksharrays
        case $1 in
                +*) setopt pushdignoredups
                        builtin pushd ${${=$(dirs)}[$1+1]};;
                -*) setopt pushdignoredups
                        builtin pushd ${${=$(dirs)}[$1-1]};;
                *) builtin pushd $*;;
 
        esac
}

[Thank you Peter and Bart.]   Because people don't care about backward 
compatibility.  As Peter so aptly put it in article 2230:
    It's yet another case of running very hard to stay in the same place.

So, Zefram, in answer to your rhetorical question: "I care".

RC, on this we do agree.

I'll get down off my soapbox now.
