As you've seen on zsh-users, SunSITE Denmark have offered to host a CVS
repository of zsh sources.  I'm not personally willing to expend the
effort to keep such a repository in sync with the master sources, but if
anyone else here has the time to spare then it could potentially be of
significant benefit to the zsh community.  Does anyone wish to volunteer?
