Hello -

In the latest CVS sources, I've seen the first character on the line
dropped, although I cannot yet reproduce this behavior consistently in
a fresh shell.  Here's what I've seen a couple of times (cut and
pasted from a shell window):

: build/xemacs-21.5-2005-03-19-gcc-mule Mon 21 8:58; make check >& check.out
make install >& inst.out
boise [make check >& check.out]
~/software/SunOS-5.5/build/xemacs-21.5-2005-03-19-gcc-mule   9:07AM
: build/xemacs-21.5-2005-03-19-gcc-mule Mon 21 9:07; ake install >& inst.out
boise [ake install >& inst.out]
~/software/SunOS-5.5/build/xemacs-21.5-2005-03-19-gcc-mule   9:07AM
: build/xemacs-21.5-2005-03-19-gcc-mule Mon 21 9:07; cat inst.out
zsh: command not found: ake

Notice that I typed in:

  make check >& check.out

and then

  make install >& inst.out

with the latter being typed while the former was running.  You'll
notice that for some reason the shell thought I was typing 'ake
install'.

Both times I have seen this the literal commands have been exactly the
same: 'make check' followed by 'make install', with redirected stdout
and stderr for both commands.

This is on a SunOS-5.5 system, BTW.

Does anyone have any idea what might be causing this?

  - Vin
