You may think that, and may even have evidence of it, though I find
3.1.4 (plus a few recent patches) preferable to anything since 3.1 went
off on its own development branch. However, this particular detail
($^whatever) has been around since zsh 2.x, with the only change being
that before 3.0 it used to mean "toggle the option," which only made
sense if you knew how the option was set to begin with.
