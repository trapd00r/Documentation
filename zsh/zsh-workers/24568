Does it even make sense to use -d and -k at the same time?  I know it
doesn't throw an error to use both (perhaps it should) but the loop
for -k doesn't recognize delimiters (or backslashes -- perhaps the doc
should say that -k implies -r ...?).

In any case I've tested this (use of "-rk" apparently redundant):

	read -st 2 -rk 3 esc$'?\e['"${seq}"t

And these:

	read -srd $'\e'
	IFS=';' read -Arsd t

All appear to work with the patch from users/12600, on RHEL4 linux.
So, I'll go ahead and commit.

} It would be nice to have tests but they're particularly difficult to

They'd probably have to use zpty and operate along the lines of the
completion tests.
