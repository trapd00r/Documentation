You can try

  root-tail <(ssh root@server tail -F /var/log/syslog)

but I don't promise it will work because the file thus created is not
seekable.

} is displayed.

That attempts to synchronously capture the entire output of the remote
shell in the temporary file before executing the local command to read
the file.  Clearly not what you want.
