: Hmm... putting a function into the background does require some tricky
: code inside the shell, but your function seems to work for me on
: pipelines on zsh 4.1.1-dev-1.  What version are you using?  Do you have
: any even marginally relevant options set?

For me, the pager gets a TTIN or TTOU or similar.  So fg'ing it puts
a stopped task in the foreground.  A simple CONT gets everything going.
Don't know whether that's necessarily appropriate for all backgrounded
tasks put into the foreground.

Geoff
