I just got this on the GoboLinux development list today, but I think most of 
this praise belongs to go to you, zsh developers.

As a GoboLinux developer, I say thank you for such a great shell -- each day I 
am more and more convinced that making it the default shell on GoboLinux was 
one of our best design decisions. I've got to join my voice to the others and 
say "zsh rocks!" My hat is off to all of *you*.
