Hey all,

I figured out why the screen status command that Mikael showed me
doesn't work.  I have the following line in my .screenrc:

hardstatus string '%{= mK}%-Lw%{= KW}%50>%n%f* %t%{= mK}%+Lw%< %{=
kG}%-=%D %d %M %Y %c:%s%{-}'

Basically that has something like what a panel in a window manager
would have.  It has a small section on the bar containing the title of
each terminal (which of course you can change with ^aA) and a clock at
the far right.  If I figure out a way to have BOTH the autocommand and
the hardstatus string I will email the list again with that.
