I've not read the C9X draft.  It's big; thinking about it, now is the
time to do so.  I emailed zefram in January with the URLs:
 <http://www.dkuug.dk/JTC1/SC22/WG14/>
 <http://osiris.dkuug.dk/JTC1/SC22/open/n2620/n2620.txt>
Also in postscript and PDF (according to what I wrote when I mailed
him, anyway.  Too long ago for me to actually remember).

Reading through subsequent email with zef, C9X apparently adopts
'long long' rather than specifiable integer sizes.

If an big hunk was allocated, such that an overly large arena was
created for it, then reallocating to a size less than the maximum looked
to me as if it would allocate a small arena.

I think.  I want to leave it a few years before looking at that code
again.  ;^)
