Yes, it's probably a good thing to have.  If bash is treating exec in
that fashion there's little gain in sticking strictly to the "precommand
modifiers don't have options" rule.

Should be fine... I think there's just the one call to execute(),
and in the current set up it could be static.  You could change it
to that just to be sure.

Ideally munging of options should be done by the builtin handler, with
the options defined by the entry in builtins[] in builtin.c.  For normal
builtins that's in execbuiltin().  However, it's not currently
implemented for precommand modifiers.  One reason for that is probably
that usually the word following is to be treated like a command even if
it looks like an option.  Still, it would be neater to have a general
option parser of some sort in this case.  However, it may be overkill
just for this one use.
