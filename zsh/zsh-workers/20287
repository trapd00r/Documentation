Looks like the interrupt handler isn't getting reset after the first 
ctrl-C.  I don't yet know why not, but this means that the default SIGINT
handler is called on the second ^C, which of course ends the process.

There also appears to be a bug in 4.2.x with "zle -I" and "zle -R".  This 
should work:

	TRAPINT() { zle -I && zle send-break }

because "zle -I" is supposed to return zero only when zle is active. 
However, I get:

	TRAPINT:zle: widgets can only be called when ZLE is active

In any case there are numerous workarounds involving trapping ^C or using 
"stty" to disable interrupt ... but they all have drawbacks.
