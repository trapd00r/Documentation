} This doesn't seem to do what I want.   [...]  That

} I had written it, what I have on the command line at the moment I
} invoke the search.

Everything to the left of the cursor at the moment you invoke the search,
but otherwise yes.

} In order to do what I want, such insertion
} would work only if a) the search would be regexp search and b) it
} inserted "^<what I have on the command line>.*" instead of just
} "<what I have on the command line>".

Ah.  Well, zsh doesn't have re-search, though it does recognize "^" as
anchoring to beginning of line.  So you could change one line of the
above to

    else zle .$WIDGET "^$LBUFFER"

Beyond that, try looking at Functions/Zle/incremental-complete-word in the
distribution for ideas of how to implement something more like you want.
Or Functions/Zle/predict-on might be easier to modify -- you'd have to
replace `zle .history-beginning-search-backward' with your own search.
