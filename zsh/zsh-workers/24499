According to Clint Adams on 1/29/2008 3:38 PM:

| Presumably Src/mkmakemod.sh would need to be generated to check that

| can't be done.

The point was: Why not just use documented interfaces (such as AC_SUBST)
and skip the grep altogether?  The underlying interface is intentionally
unstable, and attempts to grep it are bound to fail as new autoconf
releases use new means of achieving the same results.  Your code will be
easier to maintain if you don't have to add a new grep statement for every
new autoconf release.
