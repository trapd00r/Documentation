Just tried on vanilla pws-10. Copied Core, Base, Builtins, sourced compinit.
The result is the same. What I have is:

itsrm1% ls -F /
SAM/         config/      lib@         shlib@       tools@       var@
X11/         dev/         lost+found/  stand/       u/
bck/         dgn/         mnt/         svr4@        unix*
bin@         etc/         opt@         tftpboot/    unix.old*
boot/        export/      proc/        tmp@         usr@
cdrom/       home@        sbin/        tmp_mnt/     utmp/

itsrm1% ls -l /usr
lrwxrwxrwx   1 root     root           7 Feb 22 17:50 /usr -> SAM/usr

itsrm1% ls -ldF /usr/lib/locale/TZ
drwxr-xr-x   9 bin      bin         2048 Feb 23 13:50 /usr/lib/locale/TZ/

itsrm1% cd /S/u/l/l/T =>  is correctly completed to
itsrm1% cd /SAM/usr/lib/locale/T

but

itsrm1% cd /u/l/l/T
results in beep.

Oh, just found:

drwxr-xr-x   9 bin      bin         2048 Feb 23 13:50 /usr/lib/locale/TZ/
drwxr-xr-x   3 root     other       1024 Feb 22 18:19
/usr/lib/locale/Transparent/

Any idea?
