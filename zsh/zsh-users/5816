For most ordinary UNIX commands the point to start is from one of the
files in the Completion/Unix/Command directory of the source
distribution.  If it's simple enough you can use _arguments.
Unfortunately the _arguments syntax is somewhat non-intuitive.

I need to add something more explicitly constructive to the user guide
for cases like this.  I really only started major hacking with
_arguments quite recently.

A lot of these are already done in the latest code.
