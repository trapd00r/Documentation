Does a reminder about the effect of exec belong in the manual or the
FAQ?  I've had to sort out problems for a few people (normally
.bash_logout rather than .zlogout) where they just hadn't thought
through that using exec foobar would stop the shell sourcing the logout
scripts.

For those who really want maintenance logs or whatever, but still want
to exec something (an interruptible secure program), I usually suggest a
function/alias that does a TRAPEXIT/trap '' 0  -- is this really the
best idea?
