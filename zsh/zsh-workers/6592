Subject: compctl -l broken
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

The -l option to compctl seems to be broken. I first noticed this a
while ago (about pws-18) but it exists in pws-21.

For example:
zsh -f
compctl -l '' t
t <tab>

Gives a beep.
I get the same problems when using the find -exec example from the
documentation. Can anyone else reproduce this? I'm using AIX (3.2.5 and
4.2) if that's of any help.
