Unfortunately there is no production version of zsh with the restricted
shell option.  You'll need to use version 3.1.2.  Create a symbolic link
to zsh named 'rzsh', and set users' shell to that.  You'll need to set up
the restricted environment very carefully to make sure it can't be broken
out of -- don't forget that shell startup files are run unrestricted,
so users mustn't be able to edit them.
