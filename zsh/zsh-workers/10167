} It would be nice if there was a way of using globbing, similar to *(w)
} and *(r) to match files which can be written to by the current process

This should work:	_files -g '*(Uw,GI,W)'

That means "owned by the EUID and owner writable, or owned by the EGID
and group writable, or world writable."  That doesn't quite work with
group lists; for that you'd need something like

	_files -g \*\(Uw,Ig:${(j(:,Ig:))$(groups)}:,W\)
