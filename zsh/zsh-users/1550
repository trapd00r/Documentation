} disappointing! i thought that was a unique zsh-feature which did
} not work because i was doing something wrong.

What, exactly, would you expect it to do?

Your original example was

	ls | wc && | less

The closest thing I can imagine to what that might mean is equivalent to

	coproc cat
	ls >&p | wc && less <&p

which doesn't quite work right because the coproc doesn't exit after
"ls" finishes writing to it, but gives you the idea.
