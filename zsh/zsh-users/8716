Only the superuser can raise hard limits; that's the real difference
between them and soft limits.  You can raise the soft limit to the hard
limit, or lower the hard limit, but that's it.

If you have superuser access or know someone who has, note that as
limits are inherited you need to raise the hard limit in a parent
process of the shell where you actually want to run the programme.
(In other words, running "su", raising the hard limit, and exiting
doesn't work because you're back where you started.)
