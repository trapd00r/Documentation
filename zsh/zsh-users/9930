Subject: problems with multibyte support in dev-4?

Hi all,

It appears to me that the dev-4 version is not supporting multibyte  
characters (Japanese) as good as the previous developmental  
versions.  In dev-4, Japanese characters in tab completion lists are  
not displayed properly (I see a bunch of numbers).  I hope the  
situation gets better before the release of 4.3.1.
