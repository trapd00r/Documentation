Presently the 'select' command prints the set of words _every_ time
after a selection has been made. This is in contrast to the
documentation and the behaviour of ksh. IMO the selection list should be
printed once after the invocation and then only if the user has entered
an empty input line.

Before I try to make a patch, can anybody confirm that this is a bug? Or
is it intended and the manual is incorrect?
