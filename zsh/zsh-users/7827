Sorry to reply to my own post but I thought I should point out that the
manual isn't actually wrong. With the completer style from the manual,
_all_matches does work. It reuses the matches from the previous completion
so you have to press tab before ^Xx. The style I suggested allows you
to just press ^Xx or whatever key you have bound. It needs that insert
style too, though.
