something like ls *(L-500) to see all files smaller than 500 bytes, as per

       L[+|-]n
              files less than n bytes (-), more than n bytes (+), or
exactly  n  bytes  in
              length.  If this flag is directly followed by a `k'
(`K'), `m' (`M'), or `p'
              (`P') (e.g. `Lk-50') the check is performed with=20
kilobytes,  megabytes,  or
              blocks (of 512 bytes) instead.
