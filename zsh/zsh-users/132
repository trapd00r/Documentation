O.K.  Thanks. The version of the manual I was looking at, made no
mention of this option in the globbing section.

Yes.  Especially since a semi-clueless person could always bruteforce
the current behavior with $(ls <>).  Although, I suppose, the same
could be said for $(sort -n <>).

Thank you Thorsten (private mail), and Peter for responding.
