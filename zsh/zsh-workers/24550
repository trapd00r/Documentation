Hi,

zsh port has been updated to version 4.3.5 but there is a failure on
Sparc64.

Regression tests give this error:

./D02glob.ztst: starting.

Test ./D02glob.ztst failed: output differs from expected as shown above
for: globtest globtests
Was testing: zsh globbing
./D02glob.ztst: test failed.


Any ideas ?
