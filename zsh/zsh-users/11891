Not sure what you mean

*(.LK-1)

expands to the files that are "regular" AND "whose length is
less than 1kB".

*(.,LK-1)

expands to files that are either "regular" OR "whose length is
less than 1kB.

(*foo*|*bar*)

expands to files whose name contains either "foo" OR "bar"

*foo*~^*bar*

(with EXTENDED_GLOB) expands to files whose name contains both
"foo" AND "bar".
