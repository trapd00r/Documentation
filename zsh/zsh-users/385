} that's does a list after the first TAB.  I was interested in having it
} complete as far as possible first, beep, then (after second TAB) list.

`setopt autolist` lists after the first tab on any ambiguous competion.

If you add `setopt listambiguous` then it completes as far as possible
and lists only if "as far as possible" means "no further".

This is as close as you can get; it saves you having to type the second
tab when the completion is immediately ambiguous, which is (partly) why
it works this way.
