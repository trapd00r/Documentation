This happens with 2.6-beta9:

1. Sometimes i get no echo typing after the prompt.
   after typing <esc> or <cr> the text appears. 

2. Often ^Z doesn't work
   example:
    xarchie
    ^Z   
    Here i expect the prompt to enter bg !!

3. We have problems with some xterms: 
   (PROMT="%l %T %m[%h] ")
   if (%h < 10) the displayed prompt is "<some blanks><1 digit>] "
   if (%h > 9)  the displayed prompt seems to work but there is an extra <lf> after!

I hope we have some errors in  ~/.z* .
Any Hints?

Thanks, Peter
