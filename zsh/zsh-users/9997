No, I want the CWD, but that may become a problem because

1. "dirs" includes the CWD even if it is in the $dirstack;
2. "dirstack=3D( $(< ~/.zdirs) )" bypasses pushd_ignore_dups;
3. some popular directories, triggered this "double entry" many times;
4. pushd_ignore_dups removes only the first double entry.

(perhaps there was no need to explain that...)

So the solution is, AFAIK, really ${(u)...}.

Or "dirs -pl" then.

Were you guys surprised a user decided to use typeset on something
described as a "normal" array?

(users are cunning evil creatures and you should know it!)

Thank you for the explanations!
