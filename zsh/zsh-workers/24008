I don't know what is "shout", but I recall that the bug occurs only
after some command (ssh, called via a zsh wrapper function) has run
for several days. So, the environment had the time to change...

I've reinstalled zsh with the patch.

zsh 4.3.4 doesn't have !use_exit_printed, so I modified the above
lines in the following way:

-    if (isset(PROMPTSP) && isset(PROMPTCR)) {
+    if (isset(PROMPTSP) && isset(PROMPTCR) && !use_exit_printed && shout) {
