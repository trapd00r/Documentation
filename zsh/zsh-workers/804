Yes. This is due to Zefram's "big named directory patch" of message
711 (see below), though I can't recall any details of the July
discussion at the moment. You can still use `-1', `-2', though, so I
don't see it as a big loss.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

The patch below is compressed due to being 45K in size.  It primarily
changes the organisation of named directories from a simple array to a
hash table.  This simplifies a lot of code, which can now use the
preexisting generic hash table code.  Lookup of named directories is
slightly speeded up as a result.  Reverse lookup, for %~ prompt
sequences, is slightly slower, but it's really not noticeable.

It also changes ~ and = expansion, in the ways discussed in July.
Basically, = expansion now has nothing to do with the directory stack,
so use ~n in place of =n.  =- is now ~-0.  See the man page patch for
details.
