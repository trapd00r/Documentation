Great! I, too, was wondering why there isn't such a thing. Now I wonder
if this feature is considered top secret. I can't find anything about it
in the docu.

And, BTW, at least in zsh-3.1.2-zefram3, this doesn't work correctly. 

   print abcdefg(:s/b/XY)
   aXYecdefg

where the e following Y has two dots on it. But this works:

   print abcdefg(:s/b/XY/)
   aXYcdefg
