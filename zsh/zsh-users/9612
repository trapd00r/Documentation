Is there a way to do global substitution on the previous command in ^
notation?  For instance,

   $ echo a b b b
   $ ^b^beta^

yields

   $ echo a beta b b

Certainly I could do !!:gs/b/beta.  This isn't near as simple as
something like gs/b/beta or ^b^beta^g.  Anything I'm missing in the
manual?

Thanks!
