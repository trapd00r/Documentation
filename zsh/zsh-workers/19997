Is it possible with _arguments or some other way to have options that
can be completed, but aren't displayed on the screen as possible
completions? I'd like something like
  _arguments \
    '(-o)--output[save output in DIR]:DIR:_files -/' \
    '(--output)-o:DIR:_files -/'
but where -o doesn't clutter the screen. I know that zsh 4.2 would
display -o nicely beside --output if I gave it the same explanation, but
I'd like to support 4.0 as well. Any suggestions?
