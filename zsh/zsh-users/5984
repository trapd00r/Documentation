Eric Smith <es@fruitcom.com> typed:
: But one use I was looking for was to write(1) to another terminal viz.
: echotc AF 6 ; echotc AB 4 ; echo "Cyan on Blue"|write eric /dev/pts/3
: or 
: print "$bg[cyan]$fg[blue]Blue on Cyan"|write eric /dev/pts/3

Generally you can't use write because most write programmes make control
characters visible, so escape will become the two characters ^ and [

However, on a local machine you may be able to do
% print "$bg[cyan]$fg[blue]Blue on Cyan" >> /dev/pts/3
