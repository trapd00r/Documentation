It's how every other printf works and I remember thinking about it when
I implemented zsh's printf. Unlike C, we don't have separate character
and string types. So it is fairly useless but consistent with C printf.

%b is defined to be like %s except the escape sequences of echo (which
are slightly different to those of the printf format) are understood.
We can't make %c interpret 101 without breaking compatibility.

Peeking back would be nasty. If you really think the feature is worth
having, we could add a new formatting directive (such as %C). What
would you want it to do for values greater than 127 though?

I can't see anything wrong with the %b trick though. Can be used with
\0, \x or \u. Only problem from the perspective of the original post is
that brace expansion uses decimal. I suppose we could allow things like
{8#62..101}
