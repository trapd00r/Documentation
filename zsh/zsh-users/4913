Hi everyone.

Does anyone happen to know how to configure zsh so the keyboard is left in
vi's *command mode* after finding the first matching command in zsh's
history with a "/" search?

        FOR EXAMPLE ...

Say I want step through old "more" commands in zsh's history.

        $ <esc>/more<cr>
        ?more_
        $ more /etc/hosts

When I press "n" to find the next match ...

        $ more /etc/hostsn

Oops! zsh was in vi's *insert* mode, interpreted the "n" literally and
appended it to the end of the command!

Is there a way to configure zsh so the "n" will be automatically
interpreted as the "next" command and retrieve the next matching "more"
command?

Thanks,
Kingsley
