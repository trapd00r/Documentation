} The manual says foreach is "deprecated" and should not be used.

Ah, well, yes, there was a brief period about ten years ago during
which the Zsh Dev Group was seriously considering excising all the
csh features from zsh and making it essentially a ksh clone.  The
manuals got updated then to say a lot of things were "deprecated" and
the tarnish has never been scrubbed off again.

The chances of them actually being removed from the shell are pretty
remote.  They might get moved into a module if we figure out how to
make bits of the parser (un)pluggable, but they probably won't entirely
go away.
