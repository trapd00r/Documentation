No, I realised eventually that was nonsense.  That's not how equivalences
work.  This would say either an alphanumeric matches itself, or an upper
matches a lower.  I can't think of a good reason why you'd want to express
that in an equivalence class.

I think the doc may want changing to be clearer that [:stuff:] in
equivalence classes is of limited scope, but is much more widely useful
in ordinary character classes.
