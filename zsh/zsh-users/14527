The easiest way is to write a ', paste, write another ' ;). Another way is
to press ctrl-space before, paste the url, then press quote-region (alt-" by
default i think). This is more keypresses than just typing the 's though.

Another way which is more automatic:
autoload -Uz url-quote-magic
zle -N self-insert url-quote-magic
