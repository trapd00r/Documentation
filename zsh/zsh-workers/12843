I haven't had much time for replying (have you seen the specification for
Bluetooth park mode? :-() but self-documenting functions with something
like pod, except using shell functions to strip out the bits and turn them
into yodl, should be pretty easy.  Adding comments is usually much easier
than fiddling with the full documentation.

Moving the string functions to their own file would be a step in the right
direction, too.  It's hard to know what's in utils.c.  (It's not as if the
rest of the shell doesn't consist of utilities, despite the double
negative.)

By the way, I'm finally getting a week's holiday from tomorrow and luckily
in a PC-free zone.
