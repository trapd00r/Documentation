    This solution has worked great for generating, for example, a
file containing the names of the files in random order. The problem
is that I cannot use this in a command: command $(print -lP...)
results in 'command file name 1 file name 2', unquoted :((( Strictly
speaking, characters like '[' are quoted, but spaces arent, and the
names which I want to order randomly usually contain spaces.

    I've tried something like 'array=($(print -lP...))', but since
the expansion has spaces unquoted, the elements of the array end up
being 'file', 'name', '2', 'file', 'name', '1', and so on.

    How can I get the result of the 'e' glob qualifier quoted, so I
can use command $(print -lP...) and get a working command?

    Thanks a lot :))
