Which is what I'm advocating changing.  Don't require the variable to
be at the start of the word, just look if there are suffix char(s)
between the variable and the cursor, and only expand the variable if
the cursor is right next to the variable.  This is how the old
expander works.

No, setting suffix to false would make it expand variables even when
suffix chars are present, and that's different than the default with
the old expander, so I'd leave suffix set to true by default.  I
wouldn't mind having keep-prefix set to true by default, but I think
that's a separate issue from making "suffix true" work the same as the
old expansion code.
