Not directly (though this sounds like a good basis for a zmodload
module of some kind).  The easiest thing is to use precmd() to force
two of them to always match the third, e.g.

	precmd() {
	    export JDKHOME=$JAVA_HOME
	    export JDK_HOME=$JAVA_HOME
	}

Then always change JAVA_HOME when you want to change all of them.

I believe recent versions of ksh have a syntax for specifying set/unset
callbacks on parameters, so zsh will probably pick up that feature before
long.
