It's a bit random.  There used be 11 sort operators; you could have as many
as you wanted in order, but once only, so the limit was 11.  Having added a
new operator, I extended it to 12---but then realised that actually the new
operator was powerful enough that allowing it to be run once only
wasn't very helpful.  So I removed that restriction, but left the overall limit.
It wouldn't take too much work to remove but in practice it's not going to
hurt anyone.  Hitting it should be gracefully handled.
