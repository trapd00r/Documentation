Hi,

_init_d completion parse init scripts to detect "case" pattern.
It does not work when there are several cases, and spaces between words and=
 pipe=20
separator.
for example, in my /etc/init.d/apache2 file, there is

    reload | force-reload)

reload and force-reload are not part of completion suggestion

If I modify that line to

    reload|force-reload)

it works fine: reload and force-reload become part of completion suggestion=
s.

Here is a patch that seems to fix the problem

arno.
