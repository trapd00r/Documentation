Would you please give steps to reproduce this, including showing
via which completion you invoked _history?

I can get some strange stuff to happen with _history-complete-older
but I haven't stumbled on anything that seems to match what you
described.

Here's an example of a strange one I did get:

schaefer<503> print 'foo bar'                    
foo bar
schaefer<504> echo '
 (press escape slash after that single quote)
schaefer<504> echo ''foo bar''
zsh: do you wish to see all 1520 possibilities (1523 lines)?
