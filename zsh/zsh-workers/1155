Yes, but compability has its limits.  It's fine if zsh is compatible
with ksh (and sh).  But when we try to make zsh compatible with every
shells (by also worrying about csh, tcsh and bash compatibility), it
starts to get too unwieldy.  No shell can do everything.  The art is in
picking the correct set of compromises.
