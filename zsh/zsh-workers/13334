Thanks for your help. Very much appreciated.

I can foresee some more discussion with people who don't have
GNU-systems and who don't like GNU-specific completion functions for
commands. So either we find a way to check for GNU/non-GNU completion
in your functions or we'll wait until we have a sub-directory for
GNU-specific completion functions.

That could be done with `[[ "${words[1]:t}" = [ef]grep ]] && efgrep=t'.


That also reminds me that my services-patch (`compdef krsh=rsh', see
12977) is still not committed, mostly because I got no reply...
