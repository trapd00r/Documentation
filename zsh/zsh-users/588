Say I'm using command history (ie. up arrow in emacs mode) to go back to
a multi-line command (like a for loop), is there way to setup a
keystroke to launch an editor (ie. vi/emacs) on the current command
line.  Kind of like you can do with 'fc -e vi' to edit the last command
that was run?

Also, is there a way to avoid the command being run (and instead put you
back to the zle command line input mode) when you exit the editor from
running the 'fc -e' command.

Thanks for any info...

Matthew.
