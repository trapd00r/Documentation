But that can't mean that I should put the following in .zshenv:

export \

I'm guessing there's got to be a way to shorten this.

Also, is it normal or okay for an installation of zsh on a FreeBSD system
to have all these Completion subdirs for all these other systems?? :

/u/q/.zfunc

Shouldn't the sysadmin leave the BSD Completion subdir in, and get rid of
the rest of them?  Should I tell him to do that?  Or does it matter?  Are
such extras typically left in?

I think I'm the only one on this small system (of only 30 or 40 logins at
any given time) who uses zsh.
