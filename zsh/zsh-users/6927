I've uploaded 4.0.9.  The only difference from 4.0.8 was to add the
missing mod_export declarations, for dynamic loading on systems that
need to be told what to export, so if you've already installed 4.0.8
there's no benefit in getting 4.0.9.  (The FTP site is still tidying
itself up but the main files are there.)

It's also now on Sourceforge and recorded at Freshmeat.

As per tradition, I will be away for two weeks after this evening.
