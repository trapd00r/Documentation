config.guess: SINIX was renamed to ReliantUNIX as from version 5.43B00. This
patch enables autodetection of new name. The canonical host is still set to
mips-sni-sysv4 as it is almost fully compatible. (5.44 and above are 64-bit,
but this is another story)

configure.in: new version of our compiler changed the way version string is
reported (this is known as compatibility :-) The way it is done now is the
same as in lsof.

cheers
