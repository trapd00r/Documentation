checking if long is 64 bits... yes
./configure: syntax error at line 3371: `zsh_64_BIT_TYPE' unexpected

zsh_64_BIT_TYPE is not defined anywhere (as far a I can tell)

[AC_TRY_RUN([int main() { return sizeof(long) < 8; }],
zsh_cv_long_is_64_bit=yes,
zsh_cv_long_is_64_bit=no,
zsh_cv_long_is_64_bit=no)])

Should it not be "return sizeof(long) >= 8"? Or at least sizeof(long) == 8?
