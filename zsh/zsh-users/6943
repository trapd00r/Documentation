I found that the module loading didn't work because the installation
process didn't complete and the modules were not put in the system
area.

The segfaulting is happening with several other programs in an
apparently random fashion; rebooting "cures" it for a while. Therefore
it's not zsh-related. Looks like some cache mis-behavior...

Sorry for the false alarm.
