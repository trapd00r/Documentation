Hello,

I was looking at the dynamically loadable builtins in Bash and decided
to port some of the builtins to Zsh. Sofar I have a simple `cat` and
`sleep`. But before I proceed I want to ask the following.

Is this something we want in Zsh, i.e. have `cat` as a module or
should it be a function? (Might be just as quick to load).

If there is interest I'm willing to port: cat, sleep, head, cut,
with appropriate documentation from Bash to Zsh.

Regards,
