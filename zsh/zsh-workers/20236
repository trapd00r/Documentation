Subject: PATCH: modifiers with _expand and keep-prefix
Date: Sat, 07 Aug 2004 16:58:59 +0200
Message-ID: <10540.1091890739@trentino.logica.co.uk>
X-Spam-Checker-Version: SpamAssassin 2.63 on a.mx.sunsite.dk
X-Spam-Level: 
X-Spam-Status: No, hits=-0.0 required=6.0 tests=BAYES_44 autolearn=no 
	version=2.63
X-Spam-Hits: -0.0

With the keep-prefix style set, if a modifier in an expansion has the
effect of removing or changing the prefix, _expand adds it back. For
example:

% echo ~/.z*(:t)<tab>

expands to:

% echo ~.zcompdump ~.zfunc ~.zshenv ...

Fix is below. I check whether ${exp[1]} starts with $pre. Before
allowing the code which does exp=( ${opre}${^exp#${pre}} ). Makes sense
to check that the old prefix can be removed before adding the old.

Strictly speaking the test should be something like:
  [[ -z $exp[(r)$pre*] ]]
but we already have a test which assumes that what is right for
${exp[1]} is right for the rest of the array.
