Yes, it did occur to me, but nothing jumped out at me:

=====
profile
=====

32 # Path manipulation
33 if [ `id -u` = 0 ]; then
34         pathmunge /sbin
35         pathmunge /usr/sbin
36         pathmunge /usr/local/sbin

=====
krb5.sh
=====

1 if ! echo ${PATH} | grep -q /usr/kerberos/bin ; then
2         PATH=/usr/kerberos/bin:${PATH}
3 fi
4 if ! echo ${PATH} | grep -q /usr/kerberos/sbin ; then
5         if [ `id -u` = 0 ] ; then
6                 PATH=/usr/kerberos/sbin:${PATH}
7         fi
8 fi
=====
