Very bad idea. Very bad.

1) You can only do it once, and never fix it
2) Doing it this way makes it harder to run on multiple systems with
   multiple version of the program
3) Think of the scenario where one workstation with lots of home
   directories available (automounted when needed). Upgrading this one
   workstation would then try to "upgrade" all of the users,
   regardless of whether or not they use this machine at all

If you want to distribute configuration files this way, it should be
an active act of the sysadmin.
