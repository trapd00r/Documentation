Does anybody know of a problem with the following?  I suddenly found myself
wanting the history number for `print -P %h` and the value of the $history
assoc to be up-to-date during precmd().

I used stophist = 3 because it wasn't being used for anything else.  If
there's some reason that all current values of stophist are powers of 2,
I couldn't discover it.
