I keep wanting to make POSIX_BUILTINS responsible for this sort of thing,
but it has a more specific meaning than that.  Possibly this should just
be another one of those things that checks the internal "emulation" mode,
rather than having an option to turn it on/off at will.

This is tangentially related to users/8989 and workers/21366 from last
year.  I never committed 21366.

It's actually worse than that.  "jobs -p" in zsh predates the POSIX spec,
as far as I know ... and zsh's "jobs -p" outputs process *group* numbers,
that is, the PID of the group leader only, not individual process IDs.
