150000!!!

8-)

That's got to be a record!

When I was working as a sysadmin, I had a cron job that appended all uniq=
ue
history entries into some other file; and would grep that file as needed.

That would give me this level of command memory, without the history load=
ing
& saving time problem. Though back then I used tcsh, which was noticeably
slower to load or exit than zsh (at least when I migrated).

If I was to do it, I would use the number of arguments, instead of line
length.
