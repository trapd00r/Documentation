Subject: PATCH: completion for config.status [resent]
Date: Sun, 13 May 2007 20:46:14 +0100

[Resending this since I think I hadn't got mail set up correctly
the first time...]

I think config.status is close enough to configure to use the
same completion file, even though most of the special features won't
actually be matched---we really just need the _arguments -- behaviour.
