Ok.  BTW, I forgot to add all my man page patches to that list.

} I don't think this is the right mechanism to use.

It is, nevertheless, extremely useful, particularly access to zmult
(and to the knowledge of whether a multiplier was explicitly given or
just happens to be 1 as the default).  I encourage that something of
the kind be included.

} make displaying all commands it executes is a feature, not a bug.

Whatever ... you'll note that I added @echo of the commands that actually
do any interesting work, if an @ somewhere else has prevented make from
doing so.  I don't think my patch suppresses any useful output; apply it
and run a make and see what you think.
