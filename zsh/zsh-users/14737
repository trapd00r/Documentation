Great, thanks a lot for your help.
I would still like to make a request for a command line switch allowing 
to simply list the config files that were _actually_ read ( you have 
this thing in Python ( modules ), Perl ( modules ), Haskell ( 
configuration  files ) , etc and I think for a product with complex 
configuration possibilities this is really a help for debugging ).
All that said, of course the problem I had was entirely my fault.

Thanks all

Peter
