} Yes, I saw that at the weekend, too (I'm playing with a non-recursive
} execution code at home).

Actually, I just realized that that's not right either.  It's not safe to
go on examining jn->stat and jobtab[list_pipe_job] etc. in the rest of
execpline() with child_unblock() in effect (it's left unblocked when
waitjobs() returns).

So we may end up removing the child_unblock() there, but I think we need
to block again after waitjobs().
