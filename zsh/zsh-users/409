Hi Everyone

	I have a mucho problem. I was working on a linux box at school and I
did a cat foo | less. And in the middle of less, I hit q to quit. Zsh 
immediately kicked out and segmentation faulted. Not good. I wanted to see
if about else has had this problem, or has a solution. The hardware specs
are below.

		Machine: 	686 Pentium Pro 
		OS:		Linux 2.0.15
		Compiler:	gcc 2.7.2
		
iWhat was given back by configure :
zsh configuration
-----------------
zsh version           : 3.0.0
host operating system : 
source code location  : .
compiler              : gcc
compiler flags        :  -Wall -Wno-implicit -Wmissing-prototypes -O2
binary install path   : /usr/local/bin
man page install path : /usr/local/man
info install path     : /usr/local/info


Thanks a lot in advance

Tino
