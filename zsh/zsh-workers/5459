Actually that version just didn't fill the patcomps-array
automatically (it filled none of the arrays automatically).

But I didn't want to support that version too much anyway, it was just 
a hack done over the weekend, to see if I have some ideas that could
be merged with the old code (as you already said). I sent it to the
list only to see if some of you have ideas for improving the
completion code.

Bye
 Sven
