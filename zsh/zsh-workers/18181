Hi,

In upgrading to zsh 4.0.6 I noticed the following problem:
When run, the script below does not obey alwayslastprompt.

---
#!/phl/build/zsh-4.0.6/Src/zsh -f

setopt alwayslastprompt

prompt="foo%B%%%b "
while cmd="" && vared -h -p "$prompt" cmd ; do 
  echo " -- got: $cmd"
  print -s - "$cmd"
done
---

However, if I run "zsh -f" and paste the contents, then
alwayslastprompt does work correctly (same zsh binary).

What's going on?  

Please include me in any reply as I am not on the list.

many thanks,
Greg
