I also discovered this bug and fixed yesterday :-) in a bit different way.
There is no problem calling untokenize twice.  Untokenize does not affect
8-bit cleannes.  8-bit conversion is only done when zsh communicates with
the outer world.

zsh-3.0-pre1 will be out today which will have this fixed.
