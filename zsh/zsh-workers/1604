This is a rotten bug report, because I really have no idea what happened,
and I was in a protected directory so no core dump was generated.  However,
I had just symlinked some new software into /usr/local/bin/.  When I typed
"rehash", zsh died.  3.0-pre2 with patches from zsh-workers up to July 6
(none of the stuff from the last week or so, not even my own experiments).
Linux 1.3.15 kernel, ELF binaries built with gcc 2.7.0, libc 5.0.9.
