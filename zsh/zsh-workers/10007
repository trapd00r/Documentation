Subject: Problem with completion of array indices
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

This is with an unpatched 3.1.6-dev-19:

cd $fpath[1<tab>
1  -- /usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions   10   11   12   13   14

So where are the directories corresponding to 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14. As
far as I can tell, it isn't caused by anything in _subscript so it might
be something in compadd.
