Sorry. I did mean $options of course. The funny thing is, that after I applied
three last patches (6834,6838,6841) I cannot reproduce it any more. It is
probably really not related to autoload - I was mistaken. I have no idea, what
change could have such an effect.

 Try diff'ing `which _subscript' output with and

With zsh that had a bug running which _subscript after a beep produced undefined
autoloaded function.

Alas, it will probably put my idea in nirvana for some time ... as much as I
like it. I probably could produce an autoload patch - but it is more of design
decision.
