Subject: Short `if'
Date: Thu, 05 Jul 2001 14:57:23 +0100
From: Peter Stephenson <pws@csr.com>

I can't get the short form of `if' to work, described in the manual as:

  if LIST SUBLIST
       A short form of the alternate `if'.

What am I doing wrong?  I don't need it, I just need the code, manual and
tests to be consistent.

% setopt shortloops 
% if true; print hello
if> ^C
% if true { print hello }          # didn't expect this to work
zsh: parse error near `}'
14:55% if true; { print hello }    # shouldn't be dependent on shortloops(?)
if> ^C
