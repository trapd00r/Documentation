I'm have a few questions regarding associative arrays.  What exactly is
the A flag for parameter expansion for?  I mean, how does one use it,
and how does one use the AA flag?

Is there any way to pass an associative array as ONE argument to a
function and easily deal with it as the same associative array in the
other function?  The easiest way seems to be the "pass-by-reference"
technique, where one simply passes the name of the array and then use
the P flag to deal with it.
