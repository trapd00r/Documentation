i should add that this zsh reports itself as "zsh 4.2.0
(x86_64-suse-linux)", which looks seriously archaic. I don't see any
sign (from a quick scan of YaST and of novell's website) that anything
more recent is available pre-packaged for SuSE enterprise server
9--anyone know different, or will I have to try to convince the admins
to let me install from source?
