Cygwin has magic prefix ``/cygdrive'' that can be used to access any
drive under NT (obviating need to explicitly mount them).
``/cygdrive/d/foo'' is the same as ``D:\foo''. Currently Zsh cannot
complete path beginning with /cygdrive because it tries globbing and
this does not work (hmm ... may be, it may be considered a bug in
Cygwin):

mw1g017@MW1G17C:/cygdrive/h/src% ls /cygdrive
ls: /cygdrive: No such file or directory
mw1g017@MW1G17C:/cygdrive/h/src% ls /cygdrive/c
AUTOEXEC.BAT                SYSBUILD
Aladdin                     System Volume Information
......
mw1g017@MW1G17C:/cygdrive/h/src% ls /
PalmDev                 lib                     uninst.bat
bin                     login.README            usr
etc                     prc-tools               var
inetutils-1.3.2.README  tmp

(note current dir as /cygdrive/h/... - this is $HOME on server). Even if
we cannot find out all drives (is it possible?) _path_files still has to
treat /cygdrive/?/ specially, and not try to glob it. It can also always
offer ``cygdrive'' for the first component (of course, if it matches
current prefix/suffix).
