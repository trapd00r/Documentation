:I'd suggest that descriptive Subject lines be given, so as to make the  
:archive more useful, such as
:PATCH: zsh-version-number filename
:for example:
:PATCH: 3.0.4 Src/subst.c
:
:Suggestions?  Comments?

It can often be a number of files, so `filename', even with multiple filenames
wouldn't be always be that meaningful.

  PATCH: 3.0.5  improved zle display (previously stuffed up by Geoff Wing)

would be better in my opinion.  Then people could grab patches only relevant
to specific topics rather than specific files.
