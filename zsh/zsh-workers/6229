Subject: typeset bug

From: Peter Stephenson <pws@ibmth.df.unipi.it>

What the heck's going on here?

% cat tst
test_var=value
foo() { unset test_var; }
foo
% . ./tst
% print ${+test_var}
0
% typeset -m 'test_*'
% print ${+test_var} 
1

Somehow the typeset -m is recovering test_var, which is wrong.  What's even
worse, it shouldn't even be recoverable; since it was created in global
scope, it should simply be removed from the parameter table.  I hate
parameters, they're always doing things like this.
