} Cool.  Then it will be easy for you to get the real error now

I don't think there is a "real error" in the sense of a -1 return from
a system call and/or an errno value.  I think everything appears to
succeed as seen from the C code, but the file is corrupted anyway.

I hope (in some sense) that I turn out to be wrong.
