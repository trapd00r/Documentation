We could put something like that [*] in, but you should note that this
can already be configured via a style in root's .zshrc:

    zstyle ':completion:*:processes-names' command ps xa ho comm

Making that configurable is the reason for the $(_call ...) expression.

It's a bit weird that it's "processes-names" rather than "process-names".=

(Was there some reason for that?  It's not completing both processes and
names, and one doesn't normally use the possessive "processes' names" to
refer to "names of processes".)

[*] Rather than $( [[ "$UID" =3D 0 ]] && print -n xa ) I'd suggest the le=

resource-intensive ${=3DEUID//(#s)0(#e)/ps xa}.
