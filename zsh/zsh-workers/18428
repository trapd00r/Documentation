} What are HAVE_RLIMIT_RSS, HAVE_RLIMIT_VMEM, HAVE_RLIMIT_AS,
} RLIMIT_VMEM_IS_RSS, RLIMIT_VMEM_IS_AS?

After applying the patch from 18425 and rerunning configure, I have:

#define HAVE_RLIMIT_AS 1
#define HAVE_RLIMIT_RSS 1
/* #undef HAVE_RLIMIT_VMEM */
/* #undef RLIMIT_VMEM_IS_RSS */
/* #undef RLIMIT_VMEM_IS_AS */

And after compiling, I now get:

zagzig% ulimit -v 10240
ulimit: bad option: -v

} It's possible to skip the multiplication by 1024 if RLIMIT_AS is defined
} and is not the same as RLIMIT_RSS, but I didn't think that was the case
} here.

That's *exactly* the case here.  The following is all inside enum { }:

/usr/include/bits/resource.h:  RLIMIT_RSS = 5,
/usr/include/bits/resource.h:#define	RLIMIT_RSS RLIMIT_RSS
/usr/include/bits/resource.h:  RLIMIT_AS = 9,
/usr/include/bits/resource.h:#define RLIMIT_AS RLIMIT_AS
