I suspect there's some subtlety here that strace output is not showing,
and that the history file itself is a red herring.

} Does this ring any bells for anyone?

I don't use clearcase, but I seem to recall from previous discussions here
that it presents the repository as a virtual filesystem.  My guess would
therefore be that the error really has to do with some access to that
filesystem.  Possibly the code that uses link() to create a lock file to
protect shared access to the history?

In which case it's not the location of the history file itself, but the
value of the $HISTFILE variable that would be at issue.  When you said ...

} We moved the history file around

... did you mean that you changed $HISFILE?
