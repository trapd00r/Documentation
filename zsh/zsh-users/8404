Hi zsh-list

I use #compdef and compadd in a site_function to do completion
based on words in a file.  But actually the completion is on
the #lines# in the file you give as an argument to compadd.

Is it possible to complete on words within that file.
The example I am looking for is my mutt aliases
file where I want to go:

mutt a<tab>

and get 
mutt alice@inwonderland.com

and not
mutt alias aw "Alice in Wonderland" <alice@inwonderland.com>

thanks guys
