Fair enough :-)  I've fallen into the same trap myself in the past,
although I think I've got the balance right now.  I'm finding that
writing really simple functions with maybe a _files -W type of
completion often come in incredibly handy, and hardly take any time to
write, for instance.

This really bothered me too, so I got rid of the _approximate and
_correct completers (IIRC).
