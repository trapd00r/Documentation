Thanks, Sven, that seems to fix the problem with the characters being deleted,
but the insert positions are different than the other case, they should be
9:27, there seems to be an extra 11 in there.

When I run with the patch I sent before I'm getting a diff for
  line: {tst glibc}{-2.1.94-3.i386.rpm}
  COMPADD:{}
! INSERT_POSITIONS:{9:11:27}
