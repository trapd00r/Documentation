} I could just be sleep-deprived, but this seems to be fine under 4.3.4
} and spaceless under 4.3.4-dev-6.

I am unable to reproduce this with 4.3.4-dev-6 on CentOS 4.6.

torch% whence -av gprof=20
gprof is a shell function
gprof is /usr/bin/gprof
torch% gpr<TAB>
torch% gprof=20

I get the trailing space, zsh -f both with and without compinit loaded.
I've also tried it with a command for which there is an explicit entry
in the $_comps hash; I still get the space added.
