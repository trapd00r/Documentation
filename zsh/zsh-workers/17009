I'm not sure exactly what you mean by this.  Do you mean you need a larger
limit in order to successfully compile zsh, or that you want the limit to
be larger in a running zsh?

If the latter, this is an operating system thing, not a zsh thing.  Zsh
can reset the limits to anything up to the OS-enforced "hard limit."
Look at the "limit" and "ulimit" commands in the zsh documentation.

The hard limits are what is called a "kernel parameter."  I don't recall
how to change those in Solaris (it's been at least 6 years since I did any
Sun system administration) but recompiling zsh is definitely not the way.
