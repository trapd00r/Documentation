I don't think that matters.  &ptr always refers to the same address in
memory, whatever the value of ptr is.

                --- 	       	 ---
Value          | Y |	       	|Y+1|
               |---|	       	|---|
Address  &ptr->|   |   	  &ptr->|   |
                --- 		 ---

ptr has certainly been incremented by the time of the function call, so
the function call can change its value without any problem.

You're worrying about the case where we pass ptr as the second argument,
which as you say is undefined.
