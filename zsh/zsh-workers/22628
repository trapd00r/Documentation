Linux 2.6.16
glibc 2.3.6
gcc 4.1.1 mostly in sync with gcc-4.1.1-6 from Fedora

make check works fine but the problem arise after installation when I
launch new zsh in my screen(1) session.  So I rolled back to 20060619
(not only rolled back but also recompiled) and it works just fine.

Nope, I'll try just now.
