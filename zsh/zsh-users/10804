} If one of the args starts with - then won't that turn into an option to
} echo?

If $BUFFER starts with "-" it'll turn into an option to print -s, but
the placement of "run" after "echo" means nothing beyond that will be
treated as options.  (For those who have been following the strange
discussion on the austin-group list, zsh is not a GNU program and it
does not in general interpret as options strings beginning with a "-"
that appear after non-option operands.)

Interpretation of various backslashed sequences in the arguments is
another matter.  From that standpoint, print -r would be better.
