Clint Adams <clint@zsh.org> typed:
:> This works with GNU make and FreeBSD; still haven't tried Solaris.
: Works with Solaris make, as long as you don't try to use a VPATH.

Blew up under NetBSD with native make in Src/Modules.

    gcc   -Wl,-x -shared --whole-archive -o parameter.so   parameter..o    -ltermcap -lm  -lc
    make: don't know how to make pcre.ach.in. Stop
