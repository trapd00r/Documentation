Aargh.  OK.  The *precision*, in the sense that the floating point
number comes out with so many digits, is indeed 10.  However, the
*accuracy* is 6 digits.  That's because when it's floating point SECONDS
uses a microsecond timer.  That's what I should be saying in the manual.

is still the, er, right answer to the question you asked.
