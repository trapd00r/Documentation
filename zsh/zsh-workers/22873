In the zshexpn manpage
-> under parameter expansion
 -> in the paragraph about %
  -> the second line has the word 'in' twice - should be once:

       %      Expand  all  % escapes in the resulting words in the same way as
              in in prompts (see the section Prompt Expansion'). If this flag

Sorry if this is too anal - I just figure it's nice to have pristine docs.
