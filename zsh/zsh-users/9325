    I know, but both POSIX and SUS have standarized a (big) subset of
sed programs, and I would tell that 100% of the sed's out there
support the 's' command. In fact, a system without a working sed (I
mean, a sed that doesn't understand the 's' command) won't run
'configure' scripts properly and so is possible that zsh won't
compile on them, so...

    That's for sure, I will use 'emulate' because it ensures (more or
less) a sane default, known environment. And I don't care about
readability because Perl is not readable and the end user won't ever
see the regex, it's me who is going to maintain it ;)

    Well, in place editing is just a shortcut for doing a couple of
'mv's. The only problem can be side effects in the middle of the
moves, but if Perl does the in-place editing using a temporary file
and a rename... I don't know how it is done neither in Perl nor in
sed, anyway.
