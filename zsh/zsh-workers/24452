Hm, I don't really know... git ls-tree seems to not want to output ..,
if you specify --full-name, it does show the dir you specify, but
relative to the root of the project. So if you're in proj/dir1/dir2
and git ls-tree --full-name --name-only HEAD .., you will get files
shown as dir1/file1. I guess it's possible to use that output, but
maybe it's easier to just manually cd to the proj/ dir first :). I
just looked at the bash completer (which is very confusing code), and
it seems to use something like
git --git-dir=$(git rev-parse --git-dir) ls-tree $ref:prefix
which lists the file as file1 instead of dir1/file1. (no idea why it
doesn't use --name-only).
