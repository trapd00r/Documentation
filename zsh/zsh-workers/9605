Subject: Problem with completion after a variable with globcomplete 
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

zsh -f
autoload -U compinit
compinit
setopt globcomplete
f=/home
cd $f/okiddle/<tab>

Here the tab, inserts a space when I would expect it to list directories
in my home. It seems to be that completion stops working for the second
directory after a variable reference.
