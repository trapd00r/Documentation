Yes, depends on what you're trying to do.  I was thinking of having a
tree of files and making them accessible to other people; you seem to
be thinking of having a tree of files which (incorrectly) are
executable (perhaps because they come from a zip file or something).

It's also doubtless the case that some chmod's don't have -R and/or X,
although Solaris 2.5.1 does, so it's not *just* GNU chmod that works.
