Hi Wayne,

Currently, the git repository's history seems a little off (although
the repo's contents appear to be correct).

a) I don't see any new tags (like one for 4.3.10-dev-3).

b) I think the history of the git repository should be linear,
   shouldn't it? But year it seems to be broken up in one or two
   places, see: http://ft.bewatermyfriend.org/tmp/zshgithist.png
   Note that commits (alongside their tags) from November 2008 precede
   commits from January 2008 in that history.
   I am sure, this was not the case in earlier git imports, since I
   sometimes used the git history to check when a certain change was
   made in zsh.

This is a newly cloned repository, to avoid possible problems when
using --rebase when pulling.

My current git version is: 1.6.2.2.446.gfbdc0

Any ideas? Or am I misjudging something here?

Regards, Frank
