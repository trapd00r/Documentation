But they don't get modified during a normal build after unpacking the
source -- those files are already up to date in the source tree, and so
don't get rebuilt.  They do get automatically rebuilt if their source
files change, in which case the source tree has already been modified.

The source tree should not be modified by the build process alone;
building should only modify the source tree if the source has already
been modified.

Yes, I think we should be able to do that.
