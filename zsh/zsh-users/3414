Both.

Zefram answered this.

You mean you wanted to see the differences, not just know whether there
are differences?  When I hear "compare the values" I think of

	[[ $whoson == $WHOSON ]]

Right; if you did so, multios would concatenate the two inputs.

Aside from using "print -r --" in place of "echo", so that backslashes or
leading hyphens in $WHOSON won't cause problems, the only thing that comes
to mind is

	diff <(<<<$whoson) <(<<<$WHOSON)

which is really mostly same as

> 	% diff - <(cat <<<$WHOSON) <<<$whoson

except that zsh implements the "cat" internally, and you can give the args
in the same order that they'll appear in the diff output, which is slightly
more understandable.
