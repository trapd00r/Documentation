# Zle widget to insert slashes.
#
# Typing slashes sucks quite a bit on many non-US keyboards. For instance, on
# german keyboards, you get to type Shift-7, to get a forward slash. That's
# almost as bad as AltGr-0 for a closing curly brace...
#
# You could just bind something easier to type the key, or use
#   bindkey '\ej' /
# to do the trick in zsh-only, but sometimes you may want to do things a little
# smarter. Consider this: "cd /tmp". Do you want to type "c d <SPC> / t m p" or
# would you rather go like this?
#
#      % cd<M-j>
#  ->  % cd /
#
# Yeah, me too.
