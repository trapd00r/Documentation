That doesn't work properly: `viins' isn't an argument to -M, it's the first
argument after the options (this confused me, too), and '^[' isn't an
argument to -p, it's the remaining argument (this should be more natural,
it's the way all the other forms of bindkey work).  You can rearrange the
`-rpm' bit, but you need to have those before the remaining two arguments,
which must be in that order.
