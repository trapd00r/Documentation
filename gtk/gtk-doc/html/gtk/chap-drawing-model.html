<p>
      This chapter describes the GTK+ drawing model in detail.  If you
      are interested in the procedure which GTK+ follows to draw its
      widgets and windows, you should read this chapter; this will be
      useful to know if you decide to implement your own widgets.  This
      chapter will also clarify the reasons behind the ways certain
      things are done in GTK+; for example, why you cannot change the
      background color of all widgets with the same method.
    </p>
<p>
      Programs that run in a windowing system generally create
      rectangular regions in the screen called
      <em class="firstterm">windows</em>.  Traditional windowing systems
      do not automatically save the graphical content of windows, and
      instead ask client programs to repaint those windows whenever it
      is needed.  For example, if a window that is stacked below other
      windows gets raised to the top, then a client program has to
      repaint the area that was previously obscured.  When the
      windowing system asks a client program to redraw part of a
      window, it sends an <em class="firstterm">exposure event</em> to the
      program for that window.
    </p>
<p>
      Here, "windows" means "rectangular regions with automatic
      clipping", instead of "toplevel application windows".  Most
      windowing systems support nested windows, where the contents of
      child windows get clipped by the boundaries of their parents.
      Although GTK+ and GDK in particular may run on a windowing
      system with no such notion of nested windows, GDK presents the
      illusion of being under such a system.  A toplevel window may
      contain many subwindows and sub-subwindows, for example, one for
      the menu bar, one for the document area, one for each scrollbar,
      and one for the status bar.  In addition, controls that receive
      user input, such as clickable buttons, are likely to have their
      own subwindows as well.
    </p>
<p>
      Generally, the drawing cycle begins when GTK+ receives an
      exposure event from the underlying windowing system:  if the
      user drags a window over another one, the windowing system will
      tell the underlying window that it needs to repaint itself.  The
      drawing cycle can also be initiated when a widget itself decides
      that it needs to update its display.  For example, when the user
      types a character in a <a class="link" href="GtkEntry.html" title="GtkEntry"><code class="classname">GtkEntry</code></a>
      widget, the entry asks GTK+ to queue a redraw operation for
      itself.
    </p>
<p>
      The following sections describe how GTK+ decides which widgets
      need to be repainted, and how widgets work internally in terms
      of the resources they use from the windowing system.
    </p>
<div class="refsect2">
<a name="window-no-window-widgets"></a><h3>Window and no-window widgets</h3>
<p>
	A <a href="http://library.gnome.org/devel/gdk3/gdk-Windows.html#GdkWindow"><code class="classname">GdkWindow</code></a>
	represents a window from the underlying windowing system on which GTK+
	is running.  For example, on X11 it corresponds to a
	<span class="type">Window</span>; on Win32, it corresponds to a <span class="type">HANDLE</span>.
	The windowing system generates events for these windows.  The GDK
	interface to the windowing system translates such native events into
	<a href="http://library.gnome.org/devel/gdk3/gdk-Event-Structures.html#GdkEvent"><span class="structname">GdkEvent</span></a>
	structures and sends them on to the GTK layer.  In turn, the GTK layer
	finds the widget that corresponds to a particular
	<code class="classname">GdkWindow</code> and emits the corresponding event
	signals on that widget.
      </p>
<p>
	When the program needs to redraw a region of a
	<code class="classname">GdkWindow</code>, GDK generates an event of
	type <code class="constant">GDK_EVENT_EXPOSE</code>
	for that window.  The GTK+ widget layer in turn finds the
	widget that corresponds to that window, and emits the <a class="link" href="GtkWidget.html#GtkWidget-expose-event" title='The "expose-event" signal'>expose-event signal</a>
	for that widget.
      </p>
<p>
	In principle, each widget could have a
	<code class="classname">GdkWindow</code> of its own.  With such a
	scheme, the drawing cycle would be trivial:  when GDK notifies
	the GTK layer about an exposure event for a
	<code class="classname">GdkWindow</code>, the GTK layer would simply
	emit the <a class="link" href="GtkWidget.html#GtkWidget-expose-event" title='The "expose-event" signal'>expose-event
	signal</a> for that widget.  The widget's expose event
	handler would subsequently repaint the widget.  No further
	work would be necessary; the windowing system would generate
	exposure events for each window that needs it, and then each
	corresponding widget would draw itself in turn.
      </p>
<p>
	However, in practice it is convenient to have widgets which do
	not have a <code class="classname">GdkWindow</code> of their own, but
	rather share the one from their parent widget.  Such widgets
	have called <code class="function">gtk_widget_set_has_window</code> to
	disable it; this can be tested easily with the <a class="link" href="GtkWidget.html#gtk-widget-get-has-window" title="gtk_widget_get_has_window ()"><code class="function">gtk_widget_get_has_window()</code></a>
	function.  As such, these are called <em class="firstterm">no-window
	widgets</em>.
      </p>
<p>
	No-window widgets are useful for various reasons:
      </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; ">
<li class="listitem">
<p>
	    Some widgets may want the parent's background to show through, even
	    when they draw on parts of it.  For example, consider a theme that
	    uses textured backgrounds, such as gradients or repeating
	    patterns.  If each widget had its own window, and in turn its own
	    gradient background, labels would look bad because there would be a
	    visible break with respect to their surroundings.  <a class="xref" href="chap-drawing-model.html#figure-windowed-label" title="Figure 1. Windowed label vs. no-window label">Figure 1, “Windowed label vs. no-window label”</a> shows this undesirable effect.

<br class="figure-break">
</li>
<li class="listitem"><p>
	    Reducing the number of windows creates less traffic between GTK+ and
	    the underlying windowing system, especially when getting events.
	  </p></li>
</ul></div>
<p>
	On the other hand, widgets that would benefit from having a "hard"
	clipping region may find it more convenient to create their own
	windows.  Also, widgets which want to receive events resulting from
	user interaction may find it convenient to use windows of their own as
	well.  Widgets may have more than one window if they want to
	define different regions for capturing events.
      </p>

<div class="refsect2">
<a name="hierarchical-drawing"></a><h3>Hierarchical drawing</h3>
<p>
	When the GTK layer receives an exposure event from GDK, it
	finds the widget that corresponds to the window which received
	the event.  By definition, this corresponds to a widget that
	has the <code class="constant">GTK_NO_WINDOW</code> flag turned
	<span class="emphasis"><em>off</em></span> (otherwise, the widget wouldn't own
	the window!).  First this widget paints its background, and
	then, if it is a container widget, it tells each of its
	<code class="constant">GTK_NO_WINDOW</code> children to paint
	themselves.  This process is applied recursively for all the
	<code class="constant">GTK_NO_WINDOW</code> descendants of the original
	widget.
      </p>
<p>
	Note that this process does not get propagated to widgets
	which have windows of their own, that is, to widgets which
	have the <code class="constant">GTK_NO_WINDOW</code> flag turned off.
	If such widgets require redrawing, then the windowing system
	will already have sent exposure events to their corresponding
	windows.  As such, there is no need to
	<em class="firstterm">propagate</em> the exposure to them on the
	GTK+ side.
      </p>
<p>
	<a class="xref" href="chap-drawing-model.html#figure-hierarchical-drawing" title="Figure 2. Hierarchical drawing order">Figure 2, “Hierarchical drawing order”</a> shows how a simple toplevel window would
	paint itself when it contains only <code class="constant">GTK_NO_WINDOW</code> descendants:

	</p>
<div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1">
<li class="listitem"><p>
	      The outermost, thick rectangle is a toplevel <a class="link" href="GtkWindow.html" title="GtkWindow"><code class="classname">GtkWindow</code></a>,
	      which is not a <code class="constant">GTK_NO_WINDOW</code> widget —
	      as such, it does receive its exposure event as it comes from GDK.
	      First the <code class="classname">GtkWindow</code> would paint its own
	      background.  Then, it would ask its only child to paint itself,
	      numbered 2.
	    </p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>
	      The dotted rectangle represents a <a class="link" href="GtkVBox.html" title="GtkVBox"><code class="classname">GtkVBox</code></a>, which
	      has been made the sole child of the
	      <code class="classname">GtkWindow</code>.  Boxes are just layout
	      containers that do not paint anything by themselves, so this
	      <code class="classname">GtkVBox</code> would draw nothing, but rather ask
	      its children to draw themselves.  The children are numbered 3 and
	      6.
	    </p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>
	      The thin rectangle is a <a class="link" href="GtkFrame.html" title="GtkFrame"><code class="classname">GtkFrame</code></a>,
	      which has two children:  a label for the frame, numbered 4, and
	      another label inside, numbered 5.  First the frame would draw its
	      own beveled box, then ask the frame label and its internal child to
	      draw themselves.
	    </p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>
	      The frame label has no children, so it just draws its text:  "Frame Label".

<li class="listitem"><p>
	      The dotted rectangle represents a <a class="link" href="GtkHBox.html" title="GtkHBox"><code class="classname">GtkHBox</code></a>.  Again,

<li class="listitem"><p>
	      The thin rectangle is a <a class="link" href="GtkButton.html" title="GtkButton"><code class="classname">GtkButton</code></a> with

<p>
	Remember that the coordinates in a <a href="http://library.gnome.org/devel/gdk3/gdk-Event-Structures.html#GdkEventExpose">GdkEventExpose</a> are relative to
	the <code class="classname">GdkWindow</code> that received the event,
	<span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> to the widget whose expose-event
	handler is being called.  If your widget owns the window, then
	these coordinates are probably what you expect.  However, if
	you have a <code class="constant">GTK_NO_WINDOW</code> widget that
	shares its parent's window, then the event's coordinates will
	be offset by your widget's allocation:  remember that the
	allocation is always relative to the parent
	<span class="emphasis"><em>window</em></span> of the widget, not to the parent
	<span class="emphasis"><em>widget</em></span> itself.
      </p>
<p>
	For example, if you have a no-window widget whose allocation
	is { x=5, y=6,
	<em class="replaceable"><code>width</code></em>, <em class="replaceable"><code>height</code></em> },
	then your drawing origin should be at (5, 6), not at

<a name="include-inferiors"></a><h3>Drawing over child windows</h3>
<p>
	When you draw on a <code class="classname">GdkWindow</code>, your
	drawing gets clipped by any child windows that it may
	intersect.  Sometimes you need to draw over your child windows
	as well; for example, when drawing a drag-handle to resize
	something.  In this case, turn on the <a href="http://library.gnome.org/devel/gdk3/gdk-Graphics-Contexts.html#GDK-INCLUDE-INFERIORS:CAPS">GDK_INCLUDE_INFERIORS</a>

<a name="double-buffering"></a><h2>Double buffering</h2>
<p>
      When the GTK layer receives an exposure event from GDK, it first finds
      the <code class="literal">!<code class="constant">GTK_NO_WINDOW</code></code> widget that
      corresponds to the event's window.  Then, it emits the <a class="link" href="GtkWidget.html#GtkWidget-expose-event" title='The "expose-event" signal'>expose-event signal</a> for that
      widget.  As described above, that widget will first draw its background,
      and then ask each of its <code class="constant">GTK_NO_WINDOW</code> children to
      draw themselves.
    </p>
<p>
      If each of the drawing calls made by each subwidget's
      <code class="literal">expose-event</code> handler were sent directly to the
      windowing system, flicker could result.  This is because areas may get
      redrawn repeatedly:  the background, then decorative frames, then text
      labels, etc.  To avoid flicker, GTK+ employs a <em class="firstterm">double
	buffering</em> system at the GDK level.  Widgets normally don't
      know that they are drawing to an off-screen buffer; they just issue their
      normal drawing commands, and the buffer gets sent to the windowing system
      when all drawing operations are done.
    </p>
<p>
      Two basic functions in GDK form the core of the double-buffering
      mechanism:  <code class="function">gdk_window_begin_paint_region()</code>
      and <code class="function">gdk_window_end_paint()</code>.
      The first function tells a <code class="classname">GdkWindow</code> to
      create a temporary off-screen buffer for drawing.  All
      subsequent drawing operations to this window get automatically
      redirected to that buffer.  The second function actually paints
      the buffer onto the on-screen window, and frees the buffer.
    </p>
<div class="refsect2">
<a name="automatic-double-buffering"></a><h3>Automatic double buffering</h3>
<p>
	It would be inconvenient for all widgets to call
	<code class="function">gdk_window_begin_paint_region()</code> and
	<code class="function">gdk_window_end_paint()</code> at the beginning
	and end of their expose-event handlers.
      </p>
<p>
	To make this easier, most GTK+ widgets have the
	<code class="constant">GTK_DOUBLE_BUFFERED</code> <a class="link" href="GtkWidget.html#GtkWidgetFlags" title="enum GtkWidgetFlags">widget flag</a> turned on by
	default.  When GTK+ encounters such a widget, it automatically
	calls <code class="function">gdk_window_begin_paint_region()</code>
	before emitting the expose-event signal for the widget, and
	then it calls <code class="function">gdk_window_end_paint()</code>
	after the signal has been emitted.  This is convenient for
	most widgets, as they do not need to worry about creating
	their own temporary drawing buffers or about calling those
	functions.
      </p>
<p>
	However, some widgets may prefer to disable this kind of
	automatic double buffering and do things on their own.  To do
	this, turn off the <code class="constant">GTK_DOUBLE_BUFFERED</code>
	flag in your widget's constructor.

	When is it convenient to disable double buffering?  Generally,
	this is the case only if your widget gets drawn in such a way
	that the different drawing operations do not overlap each
	other.  For example, this may be the case for a simple image
	viewer:  it can just draw the image in a single operation.
	This would <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> be the case with a word

<p>
	Even if you turn off the
	<code class="constant">GTK_DOUBLE_BUFFERED</code> flag on a widget, you

<a name="app-paintable-widgets"></a><h2>App-paintable widgets</h2>
<p>
      Generally, applications use the pre-defined widgets in GTK+ and
      they do not draw extra things on top of them (the exception
      being <code class="classname">GtkDrawingArea</code>).  However,
      applications may sometimes find it convenient to draw directly
      on certain widgets like toplevel windows or event boxes.  When
      this is the case, GTK+ needs to be told not to overwrite your
      drawing afterwards, when the window gets to drawing its default
      contents.
    </p>
<p>
      <code class="classname">GtkWindow</code> and
      <code class="classname">GtkEventBox</code> are the only two widgets
      which will draw their default contents unless you turn on the
      <code class="constant">GTK_APP_PAINTABLE</code> <a class="link" href="GtkWidget.html#GtkWidgetFlags" title="enum GtkWidgetFlags">widget flag</a>.  If you turn on
      this flag, then they will not draw their contents and let you do
      it instead.
    </p>
<p>
      The expose-event handler for <code class="classname">GtkWindow</code> is
      implemented effectively like this:
    </p>
<pre class="programlisting">
static gint
gtk_window_expose (GtkWidget      *widget,
		   GdkEventExpose *event)
{
  if (!gtk_widget_get_app_paintable (widget))
    gtk_paint_flat_box (widget-&gt;style, widget-&gt;window, GTK_STATE_NORMAL, 
                        GTK_SHADOW_NONE, event-&gt;area, widget, "base", 0, 0, -1, -1);

  if (GTK_WIDGET_CLASS (gtk_window_parent_class)-&gt;expose_event)
    return GTK_WIDGET_CLASS (gtk_window_parent_class)-&gt;expose_event (widget, event);

  return FALSE;
}
    </pre>
<p>
      The expose-event handler for <code class="classname">GtkEventBox</code>
      is implemented in a similar fashion.
    </p>
<p>
      Since the <a class="link" href="GtkWidget.html#GtkWidget-expose-event" title='The "expose-event" signal'>expose-event

      <span class="emphasis"><em>before</em></span> the widget's default handler, what
      happens is this:
    </p>
<div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1">

	  <code class="classname">GtkEventBox</code> are descendants of
	  <code class="classname">GtkContainer</code>, their no-window
	  children will be asked to draw themselves recursively, as

<p><b>Summary of app-paintable widgets. </b>
	Turn on the <code class="constant">GTK_APP_PAINTABLE</code> flag if you
	intend to draw your own content directly on a
	<code class="classname">GtkWindow</code> and
	<code class="classname">GtkEventBox</code>.  You seldom need to draw
	on top of other widgets, and
	<code class="classname">GtkDrawingArea</code> ignores this flag, as it
	<span class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> intended to be drawn on.
