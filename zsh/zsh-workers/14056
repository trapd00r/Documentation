} Hmm.  No, it doesn't.  I'm confused.

You can't include both <termcap.h> and <term.h> on systems where termcap
is a "real" library, I think.  Also, notice in terminfo.c that there is

/* The following two undefs are needed for Solaris 2.6 */
# ifdef VINTR
#  undef VINTR
# endif
# ifdef offsetof
#  undef offsetof
# endif

before the inclusion of <curses.h> and <term.h> ... that should clear up
at least some of those errors.
