Yeah.  It's all because IMAP uses dot as a hierarchy separator.  But if
you want a deeper hierarchy, you don't actually recurse.  You'd have
something like:
 Maildir/.Company
 Maildir/.Company.Management
 Maildir/.Company.Management.Crap
(and in many cases fold the last two into one *coughs*)

It's possible that this issue is courier specific, since that's what I'm
using for serving IMAP (but not for the actual delivery); but my
understanding is that it's Maildir++ which is used by several
applications.  Little things which still let Maildir programs function,
some; eg, S=3Dsize in the filename, so that you only need to readdir()
without 500 stat() calls so as to find out how large the files are.

The original Maildir simply doesn't provide any support for sub-folders.
But enough people are using them that it makes sense for zsh to
understand it.

I'm sticking with compctl for that one for now.  I still _understand_
that and don't need to read 231 60-line functions to figure out what's
going on.   *ducks*
