is there someway I can tell zsh to take a / as being an indication  
of when a "word" begins/ends?

I would like to be able to use ESC-b and ESC-f to go down long  
paths quickly, ie

cd /to/some/really/long/path/on/my/system

and be able to esc-b and esc-f back and forth along this line,  
stopping at the "/" rather than just the white spaces (although I'd  
want to keep those as "word markers" as well).

Thanks!
