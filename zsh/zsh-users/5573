Hello all,

I've recently switched to using zsh and I have almost everything working very 
well.  I have one problem that I haven't found a solution for.  When I put an 
stty statement into my .zshrc file (for example, stty erase '^h'), it doesn't 
impact the login window.  I believe I saw some email a while back about the 
conditions under which zsh starts a sub-shell, and perhaps that is relevant; 
perhaps the stty occurs in a child window that then immediately exits.

Regardless of whether this theory is correct, I need to figure out how to set 
these parameters.

TIA
