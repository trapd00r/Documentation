It's not about insecurity as much as that it doesn't do what you want
or expect, necessarily.

:   * this requires more things to type (not important for scripts,
:     but this may be annoying when typing commands interactively).

% print -N {1..30000} | xargs -0 ls

That doesn't do exactly the same thing but that's what you've got.
Live with it.  I use it (something like it - ``**/*(.)'') nearly
every day.  It's the same with any Unix-like system.  Everything
has limitations.  It's still a lot better/easier than using find
or similar.
