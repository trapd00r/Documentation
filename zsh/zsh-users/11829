Hi all,
I'm trying to get zsh to understand meta characters so that i can do stuff=
 like ...

bindkey -s '\M-v' 'vi *.{h,cpp}\n'

I know that X is getting the event because i can map meta-key plus up-arrow=
 to
scroll up a line in an xterm, and i know zsh can display meta characters=
 because...

print '\M-v'

prints what i expect...

this is the output of stty...

speed 9600 baud; 24 rows; 80 columns;=0D
eucw 1:1:0:0, scrw 1:1:0:0:
intr =3D ^C; quit =3D ^\; erase =3D ^H; kill =3D ^U; eof =3D ^D; eol =3D ^@
eol2 =3D ^@; start =3D ^Q; stop =3D ^S; susp =3D ^Z; dsusp =3D ^Y; reprint =

i've set the XTerm resource...

*eightBitInput: true

and set the zsh option...

PRINT_EIGHT_BIT

I'm using zsh 4.2.6 (powerpc-ibm-aix5.3.0.0).

Anyone got any clues?
Cheers,
c
