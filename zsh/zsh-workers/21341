You can show this up with

trap '' PIPE

which causes zsh to report the error as a side effect (for reasons I
haven't investigated: possibly the error message isn't getting time to
emerge in the other case, which may be a bug).  Alexey's original
example now gives variations on:

% seq 1 3 | while read n; do { echo | echo } | echo $n ; done
1
echo: write error: broken pipe
zsh: write error: broken pipe
2
3

The numbers always come out because the error is trapped, but the
messages show where the write failed because of SIGPIPE.
