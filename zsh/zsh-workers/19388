Subject: Problems with anonymous cvs?

I've been seeing this problem since yesterday.  Anyone know what is wrong?

Looking at the SourceForge page:
http://sourceforge.net/docman/display_doc.php?docid=2352&group_id=1
It looks like there were some anonymous cvs issues due to an upgrade, but
seemed like it should be back now.


-FR.
