I simply have the impression that there hasn't been (m)any complaints
about 3.0.x stability, so why keep hacking on it instead of getting 3.2
ready for wider distribution ?
The 3.0.x line should be restricted to bug-fixes.  Just like 3.2.x will be.

I don't see in what way dabbrev, LS_COLORS and `mixed case partial word
motions' will help fix the Y2K bug.
