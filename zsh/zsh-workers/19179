} [...] That was fixed with a patch in zsh-workers 17567. It is
} not in zsh 4.0.7, will it be in zsh 4.1.0 or 4.0.8?

You're too late for 4.1.0, we're already on 4.1.1 (and it is in there).
4.oddnumber.anynumber are development releases, 4.evennumber.anynumber
are "stable" releases and change less often.  Maybe you meant 4.2.0?

} Will even be a 4.0.8?

Presumably.  There have been a bunch of patches (though not 17567) on
the 4.0 CVS branch since 4.0.7 was released.
