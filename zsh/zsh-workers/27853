} No *neat* syntax.

That isn't really what you mean, is it?  The (~) flag only applies to
the (j::) et al. strings.

However, it's not even necessary to do the ${:-*} thing, ${~~foo-*} is
sufficient.

For austin-group purposes, however, I was hoping for something that did
not rely on parameter expansion flags.  E.g., why doesn't the following
cause $foo to be quoted?

schaefer[516] ARGV0=sh Src/zsh
$ foo="???"
$ print ${foo+"$foo"}
Doc Etc Src
$ 

It works in bash.
