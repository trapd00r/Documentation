Er, yes. :-)

        DIR=/usr/local/lib/whois 
        FILE=$DIR/$LOOKFOR 
        LOOKFOR=`echo $* | awk '{print $NF}'` 

Have you considered that perhaps you should assign a value to LOOKFORE
-before- you use it to assign to another variable?

        DIR=/usr/local/lib/whois 
        LOOKFOR=`echo $* | awk '{print $NF}'` 
        FILE=$DIR/$LOOKFOR 

Also, you could use

	LOOKFOR=$*[$#]

instead of that horrible awk.
