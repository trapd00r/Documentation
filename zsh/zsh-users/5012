IIRC bash runs right part of every pipe in subshell. We run left pipe.
This makes it possible to do something like

foo | read FOO_RESULT

that assigns return value of foo to FOO_RESULT. It does not work in bash.
Just how useful (often used) this feature is is different qustion :-)

Anyway, I am afraid, changing it requires quite a major rewrite. And in
current zsh you have jobstates and jobtexts arrays that make 'jobs | less'
hardly ever needed.
