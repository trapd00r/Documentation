The best thing would be for mutt to either use soft limits, or restore the
old limit (which I don't think is possible with hard limits anyway).

The second-best thing would be for you to use something like

[ -t 2 ] && ulimit -c ...

so that the command executes only when somebody might actuall see the
error output.
