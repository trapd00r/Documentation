Subject: completion in vared
Date: Wed, 28 Apr 1999 17:00:43 +0200
From: Peter Stephenson <pws@ibmth.df.unipi.it>

(Guess who this is mainly directed to?)

Any thoughts about completion in vared?  Would it be possible to get it to
start completion with the context set to _value or _array_value, and
compstate[parameter] set?  (Maybe even a special compstate flag, but I'm
not particular about that and don't necessarily have a use for it.)
