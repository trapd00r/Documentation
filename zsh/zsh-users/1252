For big dirtrees, this is probably a job for find.  I can't see immediately 
how to do it in zsh.

**/*(@) gives the list of symbolic links, and **/*(-@) gives the list of 
symbolic links with targets which do exist.  Clearly, from this one can 
calculate the list of symbolic links which don't have existing targets, but 
there ought to be an easier way of doing it.
