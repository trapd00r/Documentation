Someone probably mistook run-help for a function that one is intended
to be able to type out by hand (rather than invoke with a keystroke),
and wanted it to become a superset of the "man" command.  Although
how that would work for any of the other variations on where a command
is found, I have no idea.

} However, the original query remains.  Why do we need $@ rather than $1?

I don't think we ever did.  I suppose one could do something such as

    alias run-help='\run-help 1'

to try to restrict help to executable commands only, but then that will
fail for anything that is not an external command, so ...
