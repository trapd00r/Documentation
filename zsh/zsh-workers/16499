~% echo "\\"                       
\
~% echo "\\" | read -r i; echo "$i"
\
~% echo "\\\\\\\\"                       
\\
~% echo "\\\\\\\\" | read -r i; echo "$i"
\

The manpage says read -r does not remove \.


Also echo removes \:

~% echo "\\\\"                     
\

bash will print \\ as intendet. Any reason? (ksh/pdksh print \ I was
told).
