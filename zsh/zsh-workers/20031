Hello,

I can reproduce the problem with a standard configure file:
If a package use gettext (I tried with lostirc), configure says:
./configure --help
...
  --with-libintl-prefix[=DIR]  search for libintl in DIR/include and
  DIR/lib
...
but ./configure --with-libintl-prefix= won't complete on directory.

It works fine with woody zsh 4.0.4.

Cheers,

Imagine a large red swirl here.
