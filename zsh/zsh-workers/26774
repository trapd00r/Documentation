Yes, this seems serious enough.

That makes sense, that is what "cd" on its own does, after all.

Codewise, we're a little bit too low down to deal with this easily and
correctly.  I think the only consistent way of doing this would be to call
cd_new_pd(), which we currently only do on a successful cd or pushd.
Anything else looks to me like an inconsistent half measure.  We would then
be executing chpwd (etc.); this might be correct (fixing up a terminal
header, for example), or it might do stuff the user didn't want.  It's hard
to decide.
