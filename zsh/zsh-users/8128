Yes, but the problem with doing that instead on only posting to the
mailing-list is that my mail provider only delivers one of them (rejects
dupes).  This is certainly annoying, as the only message I get winds up
in my INBOX.  Anyway, these discussions usually don't lead anyway, but
that's the main reason I don't like to be in a Cc:.

(Sorry for including this but...)  Yeah, but that's rather ugly.
