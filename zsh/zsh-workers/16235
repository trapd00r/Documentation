Hello, I'm a long-time zsh user, although I'm not in any of the zsh-*
mailing lists.

I've encontered (coincidently, by mistake) to a bug in 4.0.x.

Condition:
	put only the following line

	setopt extendedglob globcomplete

	in .zshrc, and inactivate(remove) every other startup files,
	and invoke zsh

Type:
	!^ then [TAB]

then zsh dumps core...

Please note that this doesn't happen if

	zsh -f
	setopt extendedglob globcomplete
	!^[TAB]

which extends to "extendedglob".

I guess "!^" accesses to "previous command line", which is expectd to
be always present even without history-related settings, but this
isn't true in this "special" case...


Regards,

Akitoshi MORISHIMA
