I contacted Sunsite Denmark about the big boss spam deluge and have
received a response from Karsten which is attached below. Sounds like
something is being done.

Argh....

Yes - we have tried blackhole for some time, but it did not scale to

Now I will look into messagewall, which seems quite good - and
includes virus scanning. I hope it will be installed during the
weekend.

That is done now...!
