} Actually, wouldn't it be simpler to use "zcurses -r" with no argument
} for this?  (Also I forgot to document the change.)

Maybe lower-case options should require a window name and upper case
should require that there NOT be a window name?

Then there'd be -R -I and -E for refresh/initscr/endwin.

I don't feel strongly, just suggesting.
