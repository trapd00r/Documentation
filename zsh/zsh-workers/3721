Hmm.

ztrftime() is disgusting.  I'd really like to strip it down to what POSIX
requires date(1) to handle (and make it really POSIX conformant) -- to
hell with existing users, it's used almost purely for prompts.  Then do
what should have been done with strftime() from the start: add flags to
the % sequences to specify the type of fill.  What do people think?
