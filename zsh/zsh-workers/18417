Does that mean RLIMIT_AS and RLIMIT_VMEM aren't actually definitions at
all?  That's the only conclusion I can see.  Presumably it's necessary
to test compilation with RLIMIT_VMEM, RLIMIT_RSS, RLIMIT_AS, use
these to define HAVE_RLIMIT_VMEM, HAVE_RLIMIT_RSS, HAVE_RLIMIT_AS, and
replace the #ifdef's in the configure tests with those.
