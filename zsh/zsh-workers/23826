By putting a + after the -q, you can indicate that the argument can
optionally be in the same word. Similarly, a - would mean that the
argument must be in the same word. So the line needs to be changed to:
        '(-q --quality)'{-q+,--quality=}'[set encoding quality]:quality:(0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10)' \
