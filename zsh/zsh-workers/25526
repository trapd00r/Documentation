Hi,
I had some issues with Zsh (http://www.zsh.org/mla/users/2008/msg00772.html=
).=20
I did a quickhack which seems to fix the behavior mentioned there, but i=20
don't know if this makes any sense at all.

i changed line 2315 of the complist.c file from
selectlocalmap(mskeymap);
into
selectkeymap("menuselect",1);

This is a "lets-see-what-happens" hack, so it might be complete rubbish.=20
Comments and pointers are very welcome since I'm totally new to Zsh

Regards,
Bj=F6rn
