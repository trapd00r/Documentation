Just change the "compdef" in my previous example to:

  compdef -k _all expand-or-complete '^X^I'

This creates a binding that acts like expand-or-complete but that calls
the function _all to generate the matches.

Hmm.  The existing Completions/*/* functions would be ideal for this, if
there were some way to refer to "all the matches that have already been
added by some other completer."  Unfortunately I've forgotten whether
there is, and I can't find anything about it in the docs ... Sven?
