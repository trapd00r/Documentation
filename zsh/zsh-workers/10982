Uhm, general CVS lore (as oft-repeated on info-cvs) is that you should
ignore version numbers.  They are considered meaningless (especially
in light of the fact that CVS has some `magic' version numbers... like
1.1.1.1 (which is the first import on the vendor branch))

Yes, it's not very pleasing to the eye... but CVS' tags are much more
important.

Bye, J
