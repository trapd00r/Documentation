} The new-style completion for limits doesn't work anymore.

Hrm.  This must have been broken for a while ... even before the change
to handling of quotes within ${...}, that would have needed to be

  compgen -k "(${(@j: :)${(f)$(limit)}%% *})"

Using `compgen -s ...' is going to re-evaluate $(limit) every time the
completion is performed.  Is adding the @ a better choice?
