I have committed all four file changes (configure.in, Src/Makefile.in,
Src/zsh.ico, Src/zsh.rc).  This seems to work fine.  Is there any easy way
of getting icons for other systems?  (Maybe it should be an option, but (a)
Windows users aren't used to having choices (b) it's all of 1k and I don't
think Win32 has been ported to the Commodore VIC 20.)
