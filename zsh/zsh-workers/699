If $LS_OPTIONS is empty *when this alias command is executed*, the
expansion text of ls will end in whitespace which (deliberately, it's a
feature) will cause the next word on the line to be checked for alias
expansion.  What you really want is

alias ls='ls -aFC $LS_OPTIONS'

which makes the last character in the expansion text 'S', so you don't
get the alias problem, and it lets you change $LS_OPTIONS later.
