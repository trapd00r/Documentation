It seems to be a very specific problem. When I make a remote login to
a IBM RS600 with ssh, I get this PROBLEM. I can use all our Computers
( IBM RS6000, HP735, HP770, HP780, Linux PC (PPro) ) and I get the same 
result. When I directly login on a IBM, every thing works as it schould.
When I make a ssh to another, or the same IBM , I run into this problem.
And its only on IBMs, and only when ssh and zsh come together, and I haven't
used the "cycle trick". I have tested out a lot. but I can't find out what
goes wrong. I always get this message:
: 0402-026 The specified data is not a valid identifier.
I can use "ksh 1test" and it works, or "zsh 1test", it is only the "sh" that
does not execute the script when invoked from a zsh.
I looked at the Enviroment, if something changes befor and after the "cycle
trick", but I have found nothing.
Is there a way to find out WHAT the zsh passes to the "sh" to start a 
shellscript???
I tried the same with a IBM using AIX 4.1, and -> it works .......
So it seems to be a problem with AIX 3.2.5 . Is there a patch we schould
install?
