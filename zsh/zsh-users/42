After upgrading to the 2.6-beta10 my HISTFILE and SAVEHIST variables
don't seem to have an effect. I am a meta-p addict and like the history
large. If this is a FAQ, feel free to flame me directly at
jari-kokko@hut.fi .

By the way, is the "size" of LITHISTSIZE in bytes or what?

Jari, who has tried many shells, but not since changing to zsh.
