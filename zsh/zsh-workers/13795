This is actually what _mailboxes does ... it adds all possible matches,
with + or @ or % or full paths or whatever ... I was wondering whether
it ought to be testing prefix-needed, too.

Sven's patch to _popd makes it behave as if prefix-needed were true
without actually testing the style any more, whereas _mailboxes behaves
as if prefix-needed were false.  The inconsistency concerns me (but not
very much).

I don't set prefix-needed at all, myself, but I don't understand the
objection to the `false' behavior.  If you're used to typing a prefix,
then you'll have typed one, and any listing will be restricted to the
matches that have that prefix.  Is the issue that you don't want to
see the possible completions that have a prefix when you complete with
no prefix in the word on the line?
