Well, the truth is that when I started working on it, I had no idea I
would ever finish it.  Whilst I appreciate that it may have saved
duplication of effort, had I announced my intention I would have felt
committed to coming up with the goods.  Without going into detail, my
personal circumstances are such at the moment that I am unable to commit 
myself to any project no matter how big or small.  Anyway, Mark has mailed
me so I'll let him take a look at what I've done and see if he has
anything to add/change and we'll take it from there.
