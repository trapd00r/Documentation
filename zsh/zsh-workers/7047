Sorry. Of course, it is boolean and can either be defined (== TRUE) or be not
defined ( == FALSE).

Exactly for my xterm it is set (defined) and that is correct. I cannot tell
anything about aixterm as I've never seen it .

                                                                          When

I meant am and friends. xenl is probably too obscure ...

Agreed (if only system updates won't overwrite fixed entries :-)

Yes. But in this case terminal must do am, do not do xenl and terminfo must have
both wrong. Too much I presume. In mu case terminfo has them both wrong,  my
dtterm does am - but it also does xenl :-)

But actually, as I discovered, the original problem was much simpler. Consider:

bor@itsrm2:~%> foo-list () {
function> compadd -- "axxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx" "ayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy"
function> }
bor@itsrm2:~%> compdef foo-list foo-list
bor@itsrm2:~%> echo $$
13
bor@itsrm2:~%> foo-list a<TAB>
axxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

ayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy

And when I truss it, I see:

bor@itsrm2:/tools/src/zsh-3.1.5-pws-25/Functions/Zle%> truss -w 10 -t write -p 1
3
write(10, " a", 1)                              = 1
    Received signal #18, SIGCLD, in sigsuspend() [caught]
      siginfo: SIGCLD CLD_EXITED pid=1664 uid=0 status=0x0001
write(10, "\r\n", 2)                            = 2
write(10, 0x00000000004E8950, 190)              = 190
   a x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x

Note the extra "  " at the end of every match that is listed. I have no idea,
where it comes from. Probably, without this extra " " nobody would even notice
this problem.
