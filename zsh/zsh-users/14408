Aha! "read -t" is exactly what I'm looking for. It's OK if there's only
one byte of data and I have to wait. I only want to distinguish between
the case of the script starting up with _nothing_ waiting on stdin, and
it starting up with _something_ waiting on stdin. Once I make that
initial determination, everything is set for the rest of the execution
of the script.

Thank you very much.
