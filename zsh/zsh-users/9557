Several problems:
  * If there's a file in theothertree that doesn't exist in onetree,
    you won't see the corresponding error.
  * I think you should use something like onetree/**/*(D^/) to include
    files starting with a dot, but not directories.
  * If there are special files (symlinks...), this is even more
    complicated.

"diff -r" (possibly with -q) from the diffutils is probably a better
choice.
