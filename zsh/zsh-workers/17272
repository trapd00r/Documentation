Subject: Glitch in optimized menu-selection display
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

It's very difficult to explain how to reproduce this, but occasionally
when I accept a choice in menu selection and the display is erased, the
word that I selected is "left behind", no longer highlighted but still
visible somewhere in the middle of the white space where the selection
display had been.

This appears to happen only when I navigate with TAB rather than with the
arrow keys, but I'm not sure.
