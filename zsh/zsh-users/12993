My function for this has some possibly rxvt-unicode specific bits in it, but
maybe it helps.

function ct() {
  local MATCH
  if [[ "$1" = "-e" ]]; then
    #nulls terminate the string when printed, so change them
    printf '\e]0;%s\007' ${${${2//$'\x00'/\^@}//
/\\n}//(#m)[$'\x00'-$'\x1f']/$'\x16'$MATCH}
  elif [[ "$1" = "-t" ]]; then
    pts="$2"
    ct -e "$3" > /dev/pts/$pts
  else
    ct -e "$*"
  fi
}

Instead of that crazy printf, you can try this other crazy printf:
printf '\e]0;%s\007' ${${2//
/\\n}//(#m)[$'\x00'-$'\x1f']/${(V)MATCH}}

Also, pasting that I realize that the answer to your question is either
what Frank said, or:
cmd=${1/
/ /}
