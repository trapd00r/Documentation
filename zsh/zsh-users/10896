Hi everyone!
I'm a happy lurker of zsh-*, now I figured I could even be helpful to
someone else :)

If the `ls' command was command number, say, 15 in history, you would be
able to use its arguments later with:

!15:0 =3D=3D "ls"
!15:1 =3D=3D "x1"
!15:2 =3D=3D "x2"
=2E. And so on

Note that you can do it also this other way:

!ls:0 =3D=3D "ls" # very useful example :)
!ls:1 =3D=3D "x1"
!ls:2 =3D=3D "x2"
=2E. And so on

HTH, bye
