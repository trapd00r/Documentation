compconf has been obsolete for a while now, and was removed just after
the 3.1.9 release (i.e. it won't be in 4.0).  I rather suspect that you
are running the new 3.1.9 binary but you still have the old 3.1.6 set
of completion system functions; this won't work at all.

} Did the completion initialization change without me noticing?

It changed a whole lot, beginning last November, and has gone through
several sweeping changes since then.  "autoload -U compinit; compinit"
is about the only thing that remained constant.
