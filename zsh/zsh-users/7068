I have bound[1] the cursor keys to "up-line-or-search" and
down-line-or-search. Unfortunately this only completes the first word
of the search; meaning when I type

wget http://foo.com
wget ftp://bar.com

and then...
wget http[up cursor]
...it completes to "wget ftp://bar.com" and not to the desired "wget
http://foo.com". It only searches matches for the first word ("wget")
of the already typed command line in history.

Is it possible to make zsh search for matches of the whole command
line ("wget http") - and not only the first word?
