I've put tarfiles containing the complete archives of the old
zsh mailing lists in my ftp site:

    ftp.math.gatech.edu

The archives of all three of the former zsh lists are there.

    /pub/users/coleman/zsh-archives/zsh-announce.tar.gz
    /pub/users/coleman/zsh-archives/zsh-users.tar.gz
    /pub/users/coleman/zsh-archives/zsh-workers.tar.gz

I have aliases so that mail sent to the old zsh lists will be
forwarded to the new lists.  I left a note in the alias file to
leave this in the file until at least 6/99.
