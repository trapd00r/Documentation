Hi Bart,

See Chapter 9: Functions -> Special Functions -> zshaddhistory:

| A hook function may call 'fc -p ...' to switch the history context so
| that the history is saved in a different file from the that in the
| global HISTFILE parameter. This is handled specially: the history
| context is automatically restored after the processing of the history
| line is finished.

Yes, it does, I tried that before finding the doc cited above.
