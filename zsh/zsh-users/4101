well i'm sorry if this is a dumb question, but i really did rtfm... just
haven't been able to figure this one out for a while....

in bash if it hit
% cd /home/* and hit tab, it just sits there (although i can tab complete
other stuff)

in zsh, it'll split out the whole list unless i put the slash after the
asterisk, which can get pretty messy

% cd /home/abuse /home/andrewh /home/ben /home/brad /home/brett /home/brian
/home/charis /home/dadmin ...... and so on and so forth

glob_complete is almost what i want, only ideally i'd like it to not display
the entire array.

i think the second question has been brought up before, but is there a way to
do:
% cd /usr/l<tab>bin
and have that complete to /usr/local/bin as in bash (without putting a space
after /usr?

i do have complete_in_word set, but that's not exactly the same thing...

i love zsh, but there are a few little things that i still haven't been able
to aproximate.  i'm sure i'll get over it eventually....
