Subject: PATCH: floating point output
Date: Wed, 09 Jan 2002 13:55:52 +0000
Message-ID: <27391.1010584552@csr.com>
From: Peter Stephenson <pws@csr.com>

I just noticed:

(( A = 1.2e12 ))
print $A

prints `1200000000000', with no decimal point.  Hence if A is a scalar the
number is treated in future as an integer.  This causes problems for
example if you try to square it: try entering `1.2e12' then `$1 ** 2' in
zcalc.  The math code correctly returns a floating point number, but
convfloat doesn't check there is a `.' or `e' in the result.  This might
simply be an effect of the Solaris sprintf() implementation.  The same
occurs with e.g. 1.0000, although that's usually less of a problem.

This is the simplest patch I can think of.  I haven't added any extra
digits because the number of digits has already been worked out, just the
`.'.  I don't think this should cause problems.
