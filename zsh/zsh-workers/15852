This all sounds fine except that I don't see any reason to declare any of
the existing options obsolete.

There is a bit of an issue with respect to combining with -s and -z, as
those at present imply -n, and -z also implies -r; the question is what
to do with trailing newlines if they appear in the format string.

(This'll be my last message until late Sunday, as I'm off to a wedding in
Yosemite National Park.)
