hmm, maybe i'm missing something, but i want to do something like that:

simple example:
"compctl -u huhu"
"huhu emp<TAB>" expands to "huhu emperor"

well and now it would be cool if vared had a completion option (maybe -C) 

"vared -p 'enter a username> ' -C '-u' returnvar"
"emp<TAB>" expands to "emperor"

                                  ^^^^ the compctl options that vared
                                       should use in input-line

anyway, thanks for the script, i will try to understand it :)

ciao,
Heinz
