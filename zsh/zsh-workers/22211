It's just a guess, i'm not sure if the problem is there.

When zsh is invoked as /bin/sh, shwordsplit is disabled, so that's
why i though that something went wrong because libtool was receiving
splitted parameters.

It happens with all zsh versions and libtool versions. I tested with
zsh-2.4.0 and zsh-4.3.0-dev-2 and several libtool 1.5.XX versions, from 1.5.6
to 1.5.22.

Thanks again,
