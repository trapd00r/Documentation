OK, I think that's a bug in 3.0.5 then.  It could be your
configuration (if things work properly with "zsh -f" then you should
look there), but it may be something that was added since.  I only
have 3.1.2 and later (which are still beta, but which will be released
properly relatively soon, I hope), so I can't easily check 3.0.5.

What does the manpage zshcompctl say, under the -C option?  For 3.1.2,
it explicitly says:

	 -C     controls completion when the command word itself is
		   being completed.  If no compctl -C command has been
		   issued,    the  names  of  any  executable  command
		   (whether in the path or specific to the shell, such
		   as aliases or functions) are completed.
