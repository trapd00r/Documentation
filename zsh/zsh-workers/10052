O.K., sorry, I was confused by manual. The description in (k), (K): "the first value whose
key matches the EXP" means (unless my english completely fails me) STRING key is matched
against PATTERN EXP. The usual usage is "string matches pattern", is not it? I hope,
somebody with native english can clarify it.

And the reference in (k) description "this behaves like `r'" just adds to confusion.

Sorry for the noice (yes, I actually meant (I) in this case)
