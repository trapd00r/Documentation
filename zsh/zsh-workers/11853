} This is dying at complist.c:1733 while trying to dereference p,
} which is set to NULL because mmtabp is set to NULL, I think because
} mtab is set to NULL, which may be because mnew is set to 0.

And all of that is because the complist module is expecting the complete
module (I think) to have created the completion listing before it gets
started, but the listing isn't created because the terminal can't do
cursor motions and hence can't handle alwayslastprompt.
