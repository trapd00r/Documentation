I just hit one thing i forgot about. The minibuffer doesn't seem to
work at all. I just tried zsh -f and ran
bindkey '^a' where-is
and it doesn't work, so it's not my rc file being weird or something.
The prompt does show up but i can't enter any characters into it.
(ctrl-r history search still works fine though).
