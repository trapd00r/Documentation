} OK I see. The (GNU) ls algorithm uses variable column widths separated
} with 2 spaces, whereas zsh by default uses the same column width for
} all the columns separated by 3 spaces. List_packed makes the widths
} variable but still keeps the spacing of 3.

This is not the behavior I see.

With

listpacked            off
listtypes             on

	I get equally-sized columns with three spaces between.

With

listpacked            on
listtypes             on

	I *still* get equally-sized columns with three spaces between.

With

listpacked            on
listtypes             off

	I get differently-sized columns with *two* spaces between.

Finally, with

listpacked            off
listtypes             off

	I get equally-sized columns with *two* spaces between.
