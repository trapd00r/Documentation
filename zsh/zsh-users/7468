One thing that would help others to reproduce your problem is to provide a
minimal "zsh -f" cut&paste script that reproduces the problem.   It would even
be better if you can include a stack trace from your core dumps, or a valgrind
report.   All these will  make it much easier for the folks who might fix the
bug to find the problem.

Here is a possible start of such a script:
zsh -f
autoload -U compinit; compinit -C
zstyle ':completion:*' matcher-list 'm:[-._]=[-._] r:|[-./_]=**'
mkdir bug ; cd bug
touch a_f .foo .bar_foo .foo_bar bar.foo.fez
ls _f<TAB>
<CORE DUMP>


Note that matching specs depend on the possible completion matches.  So try to
find a minimal set of files to touch, that cause the core dump you see.  I
tried your spec, and didn't get a core dump.

Also, there could be other things in your .zshrc that are related to this bug. 
The "-f" flag will prevent your .zshrc from being read.

If you can reproduce it with a "zsh -f" script, then others will too.

Thanks
-FR.
