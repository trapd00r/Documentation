(at this point i would like to note there are a sad number of programs
that do sprintf(cmd, "%s '%s'", editor, file); system(cmd);)

ironically emacs,
% ALTERNATE_EDITOR="ls" emacsclient =emacs
emacsclient: can't find socket; have you started the server?
To start the server in Emacs, type "M-x server-start".
/usr/bin/emacs
% ALTERNATE_EDITOR="ls -l" emacsclient =emacs
emacsclient: can't find socket; have you started the server?
To start the server in Emacs, type "M-x server-start".
emacsclient: error executing alternate editor "ls -l"

So far, i have only found lots of strange code and programs that do
not split EDITOR, I have yet to find one that does (except for git
which i already knew about). To be fair, some of the "strange code"
does split it, but they also split filenames and run arbitrary code so
I don't think those count.

pam_unix in osx (i think?),

crontab in ditto,
http://www.google.com/codesearch?hl=en&q=getenv.*EDITOR+show:_00kONdzoCk:TrU12ZEvJTg:zznBZOnQrgA&sa=N&cd=111&ct=rc&cs_p=http://www.opensource.apple.com/darwinsource/tarballs/other/cron-12.2.tar.gz&cs_f=cron-12.2/crontab/crontab.c

here's one that purposely calls system() to split on spaces in EDITOR,
