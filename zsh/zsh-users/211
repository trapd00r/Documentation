FYI (& not much help if you're in Australia :-) I moved our mirror over 
to point at the new site when the change in maintainers was announced.  
It's updated nightly at five minutes to midnight local time - currently

PS WWW/FAQ/... references should be changed from <URL:ftp://mrrl.lut.ac.
uk/zsh> to <URL:ftp://ftp.net.lut.ac.uk/zsh>, since this may be going 
away.  They're equivalent at the moment.
