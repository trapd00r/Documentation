You can redefine any standard widget to get it to execute your own code
as well as its normal function.  This is sometimes done with
accept-line:

  accept-line() {
    my-code
    zle .accept-line
  }
  zle -N accept-line

However, I don't think there's anything you can intercept when zle is
idle.  You can "kick" zle with "zle -I" from outside it to cause it to
redisplay, but as far as I can see that doesn't go through any
user-redefinable widgets.  So that doesn't seem to help either.

There are a limited number of "real" hooks (zle-line-init and
zle-keymap-select), although I called them "special widgets" which
wasn't a particular clever name, but neither of them helps here either.
