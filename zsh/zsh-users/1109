Hi,

sorry but I don't get the zsh compiled with ansic (I have no gcc) on HP-UX 
10.x.
Does anybody have the newest zsh for HP-UX 10.x (10.20) and could provide
me the installed files?
Or does anybody have a idea what to change in the makefiles to make it compile?
I don't have the time to dig into the compile problems which occur already 
in the first files. I'm having HP-UX 10.20, ANSI-C compiler.


Thanks very much, Peter
