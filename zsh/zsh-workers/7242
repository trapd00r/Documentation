*uhm* So applying the patch and taking out the "*=3D36;40" would do the
trick?
It works now with that "*=3D36;40" and without that part...

I don't read all messages on the workers list (there's a lack of time on
my side), so I have missed that completely. reading the 3.1.6-test-1
announce was my reason to get a newer version than the 3.1.4 I was
using... And I read about that cool feature and wanted to check it out
:-)
Now... I just tested ls with LS_COLORS set to my ZLS_COLOURS (and there
was a bug in there, ma where mi should have been) - now zsh and ls do
the same colouring *cool*.
Anyways, there's a bug in GNU ls :) It ignores LS_COLOURS completely and
only honors LS_COLORS - while the manpage says both work. zsh is much
better here :)
BTW: The "*=3D36;40" makes no difference for ls and its colouring...
