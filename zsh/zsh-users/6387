So I've just had to confirm both of my last two postings to zsh-workers,
possibly because I'm only subscribed to zsh-users.  (This message is in
part being sent to find out if I'm going to have to start confirming all
my zsh-users postings as well.)

I thought someone had asserted that confirmations would only need to be
done once?
