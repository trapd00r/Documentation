It reports itself as 3.0.2-nt-beta-0.12. I am not shure, if it usable
without GNU environment - it doesn't understand either 'dir' or 'ls' ;-)
Also, I am having problems with ZLE (well, I just tried for ten minutes).
This site doesn't seem to have any docs.

Very interesting would be port of 3.1 (including modules support).
