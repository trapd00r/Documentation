Look in select-word-style, which is the simple interface, not requiring
explicit styles set by the user.  If you'd like the styles there shown
in the manual, too, fine.

It probably doesn't, but I turn that on as a matter of course, since
otherwise it's not there when I need it, or I've made it difficult to
turn it on later, etc.  In any case, whenever I use patterns I assume
extended globbing is present even if I don't use it.

Yes, I meant `undo' rather than yank.  You should find it undoes in one
go.

Indeed, there's a complete separate interface as used in the other
-match functions.  (I should have called this one
delete-whole-word-match for consistency.)
