Subject: completing automounts with fake-files setting hangs zsh

Hi,

Is the proper way to configure completion of automounts by using the
fake-files style setting?  It seems to work for small numbers of
automounts, but at work we have hundreds, and hitting tab to complete
when the fake-files style setting is fully populated hangs zsh pretty
badly - you cannot use control-C to abort and have to kill it from
another shell.

thanks,
Greg
