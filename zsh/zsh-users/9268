You're right.  I'd assumed the files were actually identical, but reading
back I see Meino did say they weren't.  The "broken pipe" is simply a
detail of the implementation of the <( ... ).

Meino, if you want a full comparison to the end of the file, you can
use "cmp -l", which will give lots of output.  Otherwise, you can redirect
2>/dev/null in the p7zip command.
