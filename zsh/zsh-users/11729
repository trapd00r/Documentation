It's been discussed before here. pinfo misses the most important
features that make info great: the completion on i and g. Once
you've tried (and I mean tried as in making the best use of
both), you'll agree with me that pinfo is useless.

The only pinfo thing missing in info is regular expression
searching.

You can do regular expression searching with info.
