} jobs here runs in a subshell, where there is no job control, so no
} information on jobs.  It has always been this way.  It's not particularly
} convenient, however.  Maybe it's time someone thought about changing it.

What do you suggest, that we special-case the "jobs" command?

Zsh runs the left-hand-side of pipelines in a subshell and the right-
hand-side in a current shell so that stuff like

	echo foo | read line
	echo $line

will output "foo".  Bash (I believe) runs the right-hand-side in a subshell
and the left in the current shell.  I like zsh's way better.
