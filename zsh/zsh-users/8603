    I'm seriouly thinking about that XDDD Probably the cause have
been the cosmic rays... hitting my brain. Or my poor eye quality, who
knows...

    Errr... yes. I'll fix it right now. I'm using this in a script
and in a couple of places I think I'll need double quotes (in
addition to the quoted ones...).

    I forgot. I use xtrace to see the progress in scripts, but I
never used it for seeing expansions O:) Thanks a lot for the advice.

    I'm using 4.2.x now.

    Nice :)) Thanks a lot, Bart. You're fantastic :)
