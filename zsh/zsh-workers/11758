Yes.  It's in Doc/Makefile.in, so it's not critical to building the shell
itself.  Thank goodness.

My only guess is that IRIX sed does not understand '-ne' and requires that
there be two options '-n -e' instead.  Could you try that?

What does line 111 of sys/types.h look like?

Configure has `#define'd as `unsigned long' something that IRIX wanted to
`typedef' instead.  We need to improve the configure test for that symbol,
whatever it is.
