Here's what I use.  Possibly overkill.  The extra escape string in the
$+WINDOW=3D1 case truncate the window names within screen to 10 chars so th=
at
"^A W" can still display a lot of titles even if your commandline in window
1 is long.  Truncating the title itself to 100 characters helps if you're
editing a huge commandline (say you manually expanded a 500-arg wildcard for
some reason; no need to send all that to xterm).


# strip control chars and replace with "."
# result is returned in $reply
function _strip()
{
  local i=3D1
  reply=3D$1
  while (( i <=3D $#1 )) ; do
    [[ $reply[i] > $'\C-_' && $reply[i] < $'\C-?' ]] || reply[i]=3D"."
    (( i ++ ))
  done
}

SHOST=3D$(print -P %m)

if [[ $+WINDOW =3D 1 && $TERM =3D screen* ]] ; then
  preexec () { _strip $1 ; echo -En "=1Bk${reply[1,10]:gs/ /_/}=1B\\=1B]0;$=
SHOST: ${reply[1,100]}=07" }
else
  case $TERM in
    xterm*|screen*)
      preexec () { _strip $1 ; echo -En "=1B]0;$SHOST: $reply[1,100]=07" } =
;;
  esac
