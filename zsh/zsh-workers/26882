Tags weren't being pushed, so the newest one (I assume you meant
4.3.9-dev-3) wasn't in the public repo, and older tags were pointing
to older hash values.  See if my tag push helps your other issue too
(since I'm not sure what visualization tool you were using).  The
various http://zsh.git.sf.net/ shortlog pages show the tags in their
right places now.
