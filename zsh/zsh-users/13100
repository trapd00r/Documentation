It isn't.  I built it for solaris (snv 77) recently and ran into some
build script issues.  IIRC nothing major.  It does require icmake
though, which was also similarly difficult to make.

I contacted the author, and the debian package thingy is the official
place for it, it seems.  I don't recall offhand where I got icmake,
but it isn't that hard to find with google.
