You'll need to unmetafy any string getting passed into
pcre_get_substring_list() and metafy() the resulting captures coming
out.  You should duplicate any string that needs unmetafying, since
otherwise it's in place and you may need the metafied form later (you do
for the string passed in as the first argument).
