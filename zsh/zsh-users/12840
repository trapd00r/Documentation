Yeah, that's what worked for me too.

This Is Not Obvious. (tm)

I was looking for information on how to load already-existing
widgets into zle, not creat new ones.  The -N option says:

    -N WIDGET [ FUNCTION ]
          Create a user-defined widget.  If there is already a widget
          with the specified name, it is overwritten.

This is clearly not what I was looking for, so I stopped reading at
that point and moved on to the next option.

I only figured it out because of comments in the source file for
edit-command-line.
