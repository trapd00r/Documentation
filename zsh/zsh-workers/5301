In the past couple of months we've identified several instances where patches
that went in to 3.0.x failed to be included in 3.1.x.  Does anybody have any
clever ideas how to find _all_ such instances?

Diffs are mostly useless because the file structure has changed so much.
Comparing change logs is no help either.
