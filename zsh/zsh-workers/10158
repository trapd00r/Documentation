Subject: ignored-patterns giving correction a go
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

I added the following to by .zshrc after seeing it in Peter's Zsh Guide
as an example:

zstyle ':completion:*:functions' ignored-patterns '_*'

This is often very useful because I don't get functions beginning with
underscores until I've actually typed the underscore. The trouble is
that the correction completer gets to have a go before completion is
tried without the ignored-patterns so for e.g which _co<tab> offers me
corrections such as co. Is there any way around this?

Oliver
