IEEE 1003.1-2001 claims that scalb is deprecated and that the prototype
is double scalb(double, double).  glibc 2.3 uses the same prototype, but
only if you define _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED, _BSD_SOURCE, or _SVID_SOURCE.

zsh passes an int as the second argument, and of course it links fine.

Should this be changed to scalbln or scalbn?  Should the $(( )) name
be changed as well?
