if i understand it correctly... if zsh (or most/all other shells) spawns a 
process that is "terminated" by a signal, the exit status returned (to?) 
by the shell is 128+SIGNAL. but what about processes that are 
stopped/suspended by signals (most likely ^Z, on the command line)? if a 
process is stopped/suspended by a ^Z, is there *any* way for the parent 
shell to figure out if the process was suspended? or to differentiate if 
the return status just happens to be the same as a TSTP signal number?

thanks...
