I find the zsh precedence more intuitive but that's not of much
help given that I get to use those binary operators mostly only
in C/perl, so I have to know the C precedence anyway.

And having zsh behaving differently doesn't help at all.

Actually, I reported that bug because I wanted to double check
what the C precedence was for & vs ==. I thought that was one of
those unintuitive cases where "==" had precedence, but in doubt,
I checked with zsh's $((...)) that told me I was wrong.
Fortunately, I did reread the C precedence chart and tried with
another shell, otherwise I'd have been fooled by zsh...

But I now know that zsh's precedence is not the same as
elsewhere so I hopefully won't be fooled again.
