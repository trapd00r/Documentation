 Hi Folks,

  Thanks for a really great shell. I would like to know if anybody is planning on supporting yum. I have used the completion for apt-get on debian and now cannot imagine a life without intelligent zsh completion any program.

  So is anybody working on Yum? Will it be really tough to port the apt completion routines to Yum?

  Thanks in Advance.
