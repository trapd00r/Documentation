hi all!

when i use bindkey -e, i can insert one character 10 times with
ESC 10 <character>.

With vi one normally uses something like 10i<character>.
This is not possible with ZSH ( bindkey -v set ).
One real advantage of bindkey -e here.
Has someone thought about inventing something like it?

(BTW: the bash cannot do it, too. nor can tcsh.)
Until now i just switch to EMACS-mode but of course it would be
something, if this usual vi-behavior was possible.

Matthias
