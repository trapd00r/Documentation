Hey, that's good, I didn't think about adding such files -- we could
use that to replace `_x_options', too (with `_x_arguments', which
could probably still be a pattern function).

Now that I've added `Pbmplus', I'd vote for `Completion/X' (and later
`Completion/Gnu', etc.). We'll have to move some things around when we 
come to the next open release anyway...
