} but maybe zsh should handle this type of problem..

The question is, what is "this type".  I think it's more likely that the
problem is:

} each line starts with one or more <nul> characters followed
} by the command strings..

Zsh assumes that a history file consists only of the commands themselves;
even when `extended_history' is set, it inserts time stamps in `: ...;'
form so that they can be interpreted as commands. 

Any idea which shell created the .sh_history file in the first place?
