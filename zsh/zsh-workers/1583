I recently asked your opininions about the CONTRIBUTORS file but noone
replied.  Does that means that noone is concerned about that and everyone
is satisfied with the present situation?

I cannot rewrite CONTRIBUTORS alone because I do not know what happened in
the development of zsh before 1995.  If you lost my original mail about
that I can send it again.

Zoltan
