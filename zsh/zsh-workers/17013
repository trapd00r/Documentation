} cvs server: nothing known about _chkconfig

If you really got that message from "cvs add", you are running it in the
wrong directory.  My guess from this:

} and later cvs up/diff just show
} 
} bor@itsrm2% cvs up
} ? Completion/Redhat/Command/_chkconfig

... is that you should run

	cvs add Completion/Redhat/Command/_chkconfig

Then, if you have a new enough version of CVS, you should be able to do

	cvs diff -N -u

to generate a patch that includes the entire new file.  (Older versions
of cvs choke on the -N there.)
