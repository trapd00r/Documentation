The server side /etc/zshrc:
http://pastebin.com/m65da7ea1

How can I see in zsh of server side if TGETENT_ACCEPTS_NULL is set?

On the server side (where zsh crashes) there is no command 'infocmp'.
The server is running FreeBSD. On the client side, here is the output
of 'infocmp -C linux':

Thanks in advance.
