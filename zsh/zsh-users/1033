Yeah, this would be nice.  Presumably this is kind of related to the EQUALS 
option, but for completion.  Also, for these particular options, then the 
brand new -/ flag is better than the -f flag, since these are all supposed to 
be directories.  (Or it will be, once everybody has a zsh which supports "-/".)

This would be nice for commands like make, too, where make variable 
assignments are often filenames (not necessarily directory names, though).  Or 
can this be done easily already?
