Incremental search relies quite heavily on internal handling of
character input.  See incremental-complete-word for why it's not a whole
barrel of laughs trying to implement incremental commands as a function
widget.

When I did the original multibyte conversion, I stuck in a note in the
isearch code saying that it would be neater to convert to multibyte
strings rather than wide characters for searching.  I'm not sure now why
I didn't: history lines are stored as multibyte strings, so there's much
less overall convesion that way, but for some reason that now escapes me
(but could become horribly clear again) I thought it was difficult.
Once that's done, it's a relatively straightforward change to add
internal isearch widgets that do pattern searching (with 99% of the code
in common with the current isearch widgets).
