Subject: Use of named directories in completions broken.
Date: Mon, 30 Apr 2001 11:37:27 +0100
From: Peter Stephenson <pws@csr.com>

Some recent change has broken named directories in completions.  It now
insists on trying to expand it instead.  I use _expand in my list of
completers to do expansion; removing this seems to fix it, and using
expand-or-complete instead works OK.

I don't have any of the prefix or suffix styles to anything non-standard.
