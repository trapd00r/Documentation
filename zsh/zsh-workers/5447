I think the completion stuff is one of the most important aspects of zsh 
(it is what motivated me to switch to zsh from tcsh).  So, I'd love to 
contribute to this discussion.

However, I must admit that I haven't understood most of the completion 
related discussion to date.  I think this is in part because it is a 
complex subject, but also because I came in in the middle of the 
development.

The thing that'd help me understand most is an easy way to see a 
function call trace when __complete_expand-or-complete and friends get 
called.  Is something like that possible?
