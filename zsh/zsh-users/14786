nomenucomplete (synonym for unsetopt menucomplete) is the default.

Using zsh-4.3.10, the only completion-related option I have is:

$ setopt | grep -E 'comp|menu'
noautomenu

(i.e. 'setopt noautomenu' or 'unsetopt automenu')

Firing up bash-4.something it appears to work the same.

If that doesn't work for you, your distribution might set something up 
in /etc{,/zsh}/{,z{,sh}}{profile,env,rc}
(i.e. a bunch of places w/ or w/o a preceding zsh in the name of the 
file or directory.)

I always look in 'man zshall', since I never know what submanual things 
are in.  For more information on this in zshall, you can find options 
relevant to completion by searching 2-3 times for 'Completion' or once 
for 'ALWAYS_LAST_PROMPT'.

In this particular instance, you should also take a look at 'man 
zshoptions', which starts off with a description of the ways to specify 
options (i.e. the facts that 'AUTO_MENU' is equivalent to 'automenu' and 
that 'noautomenu' is equivalent to 'unsetopt automenu'.)

I also see BASH_AUTO_LIST (i.e. 'setopt bashautolist'), which might have 
relevance here.
