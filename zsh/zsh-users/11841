Subject: Support for inverting of options?
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Content-Disposition: inline

Hi all,

I am wondering what other people think about an option like vim's

  :set invoption

for ZSH. At the moment, you can either set or unset an option,
but toggling it intot the other state is not possible without some
extra wrapper. While

  toggleopt () {
    [[ -o $1 ]] && unsetopt $1 || setopt $1
  }

works fine, especially with

  compdef _options toggleopt

it would still be nice to be able to do

  setopt invtransientrprompt

What do you guys think about this? Is this a worthwhile feature
or is this use case pretty much limited to myself?


Richard
