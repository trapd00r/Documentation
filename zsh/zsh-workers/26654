Subject: Re: Echoing of 8-bit-characters broken after 4.3.2 (solved)

Special thanks to Phil Pennock who made me see the light. Indeed it
suffices to

export LC_CTYPE=en_US.ISO8859-1

to get the old behavior back with 8-bit-chars echoed unchanged.
Tab-completion works also. This is for a shell with multibyte support
(--enable-multibyte) compiled in.

Bart, setting LANG would definitely be overkill, because I do not want
message language, time-format etc. to be affected. (FWIW, not even
a change to the collation sequence).

Now, since this is a silent change under the hood and I cannot believe
to be the only one to be hurt by it, may I suggest to place a hint
into the man page (or maybe at least the faq)? Something like (in
zshparams):

  LC_CTYPE <S>
       This variable determines the locale category for character
       handling functions. If you want 8-bit-characters echoed back
       and working tab completion on a system which does not use
       utf-8, consider to set the locale appropriately, e.g. export
       LC_CTYPE=en_US.ISO8859-1.

Many thanks to everyone!
