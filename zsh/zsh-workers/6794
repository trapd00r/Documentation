You are so fast in coding :-) that I don't have time to ask questions.

Local keymaps imply the ability to switch between keymaps (well, it was
internally always there). That returns us to the old question - is it possible
to siwtch keymap on-the-fly? Curently, it seems, that

bindkey -A viins main

will change your keymap from emacs to vi. Is it the correct way? Unforunately,
after

bindkey -A vicmd main

no more input is possible. I would expect, that at least `a' would bring me back
to viins.
