We could do something sneaky like fork a child with most signals blocked 
that does nothing but write the history file and exit, while the parent 
exits immediately to fake out _its_ parent.  That's not a very resource- 
friendly idea, though, because (among other things) it might fail due to 
inability to fork.  However, it's probably the only one that covers all 
cases short of catastrophe.

On the other hand, in that case the changes get lost entirely, which might
be just as confusing.

So a signal in the middle of that rewrite would still be an issue, even if
we change the exit-time behavior.
