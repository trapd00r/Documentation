} I won't check this in until you've had a chance to fault my logic.

It's not the first time it's come up, and I think changing the default
is the right thing, but perhaps there should be a way to cause the
value to be read from the tty.  Unfortunately I can't think just now
of a convenient way to express that.

However, I suggest that the new default be for BAUD to not be set at
all, rather than set to zero.  The only useful effect of having it
set to zero is that you can use $+BAUD to determine whether zsh was
compiled with HAVE_SELECT.
