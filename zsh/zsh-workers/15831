Dear Clint,

If you feel your time has been "wasted by the aftermath", maybe you should
consider not further wasting other people's time by submitting such an
insensitive post during this dreadful time. I personally feel I'd rather
"waste time" being saddened by the event than being offended reading your
post.

And how are hijackings and terrorism not our business?
