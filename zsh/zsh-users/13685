At the moment there isn't, but it would be possible to add the output
from

  cvs status ChangeLog | awk '/Working revision:/ { print $3 }'

to a variable such as $ZSH_PATCHLEVEL.  However, this needs careful
handling to make sure it doesn't get run where CVS isn't available.

I tend to refer to it by the command name "zsh".  If you want an
expanded version it's less standard, but "Z shell" as in the manual or,
in titles such as that of the book "Z Shell", is probably good enough.
