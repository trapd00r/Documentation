Builds and installs clean on cygwin.

I can offer little in the way of testing though, as it's so feature rich and 
I barely use it.
but at least ./configure, make, make install (just like that, no options or 
environment variables) offered no errors and the result runs.

MinGW was another story:

bkw@tv /cygdrive/d/src/zsh-4.3.4
$ ./configure:

But MinGW is such an odd environment this doesn't mean much. Plus I'm still 
just beginning to try this build so I'm not actually yelling for help yet as 
there are tons of things I haven't tried yet. (like join the mingw mail list 
even)
Mostly just wanted to report no problems on cygwin.
For the record the way I'm using mingw, so far, is to use cygwin with 
mingw's bin prepended to PATH, rather than msys, and it's working ok to 
build some other dead simple utils at least.
