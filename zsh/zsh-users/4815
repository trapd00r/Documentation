isn't this the constant tech (user) problem? when was the last time you
heard a user ask The Right Question[tm]? kind of a chicken/egg thing;
the techie can't read the user's mind and the user doesn't know how to
formulate his questionsi/comments. (FWIW, i think the user's guide does 
a pretty good job at reading minds although there should always be room for
improvment of course).

sorry, my comments probably weren't very helpful. :( just was thinking a
little about the larger problem.
