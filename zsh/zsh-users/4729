Are you sure this isn't a $path problem, that is, are you really
executing the same fdisk binary in both cases?  I don't *think*
filesize limits should affect a raw disk device file.

} Trying to set the filesize limit to 'unlimited' or a large
} value gives an error message saying it's not possible to
} use such a big value.

This doesn't sound like a zsh error message, but I can't be sure.  It
would be helpful if you quoted the *exact* message.
