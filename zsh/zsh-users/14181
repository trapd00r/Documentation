I have uploaded version 4.3.10 of zsh:

ftp://ftp.zsh.org:/pub/zsh-4.3.10.tar.gz
ftp://ftp.zsh.org:/pub/zsh-4.3.10.tar.bz2
ftp://ftp.zsh.org:/pub/zsh-4.3.10-doc.tar.gz
ftp://ftp.zsh.org:/pub/zsh-4.3.10-doc.tar.bz2

Please see if there are any significant problems before I upload this to
sourceforge and announce it on freshmeat.

Thank you to everyone who helped.


The release notes are fairly short:

Versions 4.3.10 largely contains bugfixes with a few minor additions.

See the NEWS file for more detailed information.



The new features in the main shell are:

The command "emulate <mode> -c ..." evaluates an expression in a given
emulation.  The emulation is sticky for functions defined within the
expression.

The variable CORRECT_IGNORE gives a pattern that can be ignored
in spelling correction.  CORRECT_IGNORE='_*' ignores completion functions.

The option POSIX_ALIASES improves compatibility of aliases with other
shells.

The variable ZSH_PATCHLEVEL can be used to test for unreleased versions of
the shell; it is present but less useful in released versions.

The variables ZLE_REMOVE_SUFFIX_CHARS and ZLE_SPACE_SUFFIX_CHARS allow more
control over the way automatically removed suffixes are treated in
completion.
