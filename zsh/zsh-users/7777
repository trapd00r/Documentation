Somewhere in one of the startup scripts someone has put `setopt
noclobber'.  You need to turn it off:

unsetopt noclobber

Putting this in ~/.zshrc should be late enough to cancel it if it's in
one of the system startup scripts.

The option actually exists in bash, too, but clearly wasn't turned on.
