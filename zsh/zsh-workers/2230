Well, if I adapt your suggestion to:

pushd () {
        setopt localoptions globsubst
        unsetopt ksharrays
        case $1 in
                +*) setopt pushdignoredups
                        builtin pushd ${${=$(dirs)}[$1+1]};;
                -*) setopt pushdignoredups
                        builtin pushd ${${=$(dirs)}[$1-1]};;
                *) builtin pushd $*;;
 
        esac
}

(since I need ~ expansion and I don't want to count entry 0 from dirs
in the array indexing) I seem to get basically what I want.  It's yet
another case of running very hard to stay in the same place.
