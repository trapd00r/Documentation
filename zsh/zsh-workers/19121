PWS already answered this, which I could have if I'd read the patch more
closely to begin with ...

} Or, yet more generally, specify a function to transform the array into

Aside from the problem PWS explained, that's creeping into the realm
of "discipline functions" which ksh supports.  That'll probably be
added to zsh at some point in the future.
