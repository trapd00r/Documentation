Yes, I feel like that myself.

Yep.  I was half-heartedly playing with the idea of a setopt-option,
something like silent_disown or, better, disown_auto_continue.

True.  I had forgotten about this shortcut.

I would actually prefer it if they would differ.  The only possible way
to implement this is adding a global variable that gets set in execcmd()
and tested in bin_fg().  Not nice, but since execcmd() actually inserts
a `disown' into the list of command words, these cases are
indistinguishable for bin_fg().
