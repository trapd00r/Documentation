it could be me alone, but i guess that arrays for one and then
parameters with another description would be nice.
perhaps because it is easier for the eye. have problems to have a
series of ::: after each other. (my biggest problem with the new
completion system. thats like using FPATH instead of fpath, i
like the new way that ZSH solves the problem of pathes with an
array. it's not the same here but it still is full of words.)

hmm, what do the others think?
