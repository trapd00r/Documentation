You mean with extendedglob turned off.

I tried it with extendedglob turned on (this is for aficionados only):

% [[ 'foo' = (#)foo ]] && echo yes
yes

It looks like it's valid to have zero globbing flags.  The manual
doesn't actually say this in as many words, but it's sort of useful:

% typeset approx
% [[ foo = (#$approx)fo ]] && echo yes
% approx=a1
% [[ foo = (#$approx)fo ]] && echo yes
yes

Note no globsubst trickery needed:  $approx can be a straight string as
long as the # is unquoted.  This probably needs documenting.  However,
I think all globbing flags can be turned off by other flags, so having
none isn't actually that useful.
