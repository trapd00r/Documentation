Subject: Bug with exit status of zsh -c
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

This recently bit me in a procmail recipe.

	zsh -fc '! print several words here | fgrep -i -s -e words'

returns an exit status of zero.  The leading ! should cause it to return a
nonzero exit status.  By contrast,

	bash -fc '! print several words here | fgrep -i -s -e words'

correctly exits with status 1.

This bug affects zsh 3.0.x, 3.1.x, 4.0.x.
