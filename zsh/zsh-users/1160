"<" does a string comparison.  For a numeric comparison, you want "-lt".

"=" (or the preferred "==") also does string comparison.  You should
really use "-eq" here.

I've just noticed that this is exactly the opposite convention from Perl.
I can even see why the difference was historically inevitable.
