Hi Mark,

I'm not a real vi mode expert, since I tend to use emacs mode, so I'm
copying this to the mailing list to see if anyone knows more about it.  I
do know one thing has changed sometime during the 3.x series: the bindings
for insert mode and command mode are now completely separate, whereas
earlier they were interdependent in a slightly ugly way.  For the TAB
problem, maybe

bindkey -a '^i' expand-or-complete

fixes things?  TAB is bound in insert mode, but apparently not command
mode; maybe someone else remembers this changing (it would have been a few
years ago now).  The -a refers to the `alternate' key map, which is the
command mode map.  Something similar may be going on with the other, but
I'd better leave it to someone who knows that better or I'll get in a
tangle.

I'd be happy to read through your chapter on zsh; there may be other
takers.

Regards,
Peter Stephenson
