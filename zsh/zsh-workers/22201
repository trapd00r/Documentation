Hi,

Would that:

http://groups.google.com/group/comp.unix.shell/msg/18e47b386da472bd

be an already known issue.

Essentially:

$ zsh << \E
heredoc> echo $(
heredoc>    case x in  x) echo x;; esac
heredoc> )
heredoc>
heredoc> echo $(
heredoc>    echo comment # with )
heredoc> )
heredoc>
heredoc> echo $(
heredoc> cat <<\eof
heredoc>       here-doc with )
heredoc> eof
heredoc> )
heredoc>
heredoc> echo $(
heredoc> cat <<\eof
heredoc>    '   # or a single back- or doublequote
heredoc> eof
heredoc> )
heredoc> E
zsh: parse error near `;;'
zsh: parse error near `)'
comment
zsh: parse error near `)'
here-doc with
zsh: command not found: eof
zsh: parse error near `)'
zsh: parse error near `$('

Best regards,
Stéphane
