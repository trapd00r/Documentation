Damn post sent before I finished

On this web site

http://fink.sourceforge.net/doc/porting/shared.php

They talk about porting to Mac OS X and some pitfalls in doing so

I thing it talks about is .dylib files.

I not a programmer and don't have much experience with compiling programs.

But I would be willing to test out any patches you have.

Or has this been fixed in the snapshots?

I am using Mac OS X 10.1 with Darwin 14.1
