What exactly cant you get to work? Have you compiled and installed it
in your own file space? Ive just compiled zsh on AIX 4.1/RS6000
and it built OK.

I know that you can't change your login shell to any shell not
listed in the file /etc/security/login.cfg. Either you have to
get your local sys admin involved or have your existing login shell
start zsh (which is a little unpleasant but Ive done it).
