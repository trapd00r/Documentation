A classic solution:

    function test1 () {
    exec 10<<"EOF"
    ...
    ...
    EOF
	awk -f /dev/fd/10
    exec 10<&-
    }

I didn't have to patch anything.  I just have to keep track of fd's
instead of external files.  If the here-documents don't change, then I
can put 'exec' outside the function.
