Roughly.

----- Forwarded message from Vincent Lefevre <vincent@vinc17.org> -----

Package: zsh-beta
Version: 4.2.1-dev-1+20041022-1
Severity: normal

When I do a completion like "svn st [TAB]" in a working copy, I get
the following error message:

_arguments:comparguments:208: invalid argument: display

Removing the .zcompdump file and restarting zsh had no effect on this
problem.

Completions still work with zsh from the zsh package (/bin/zsh4).

Note: I have subversion version 1.0.9-2 (current unstable).
