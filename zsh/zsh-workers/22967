My guess would be that the native-input characters are not bound to
anything in ZLE when multibyte is enabled, and zsh is seeing them as
mutli-character sequences rather than as a single multibyte character.

Try adding a few "bindkey -s" commands to bind some of the native-input
byte sequences to insert-composed-character keystroke-sequences.

If that works, we may eventually be able to add something similar to
"bindkey -m" to set up those bindings automatically.
