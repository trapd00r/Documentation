I tried that. While that cures the ~vim<tab> problem, it stops
variables from being expanded, like:

    % print $HISTSIZE<tab>
    % print 9999

Also, the compsys(1) manual advises one to use _expand before
_complete, for full pleasure. :)

Yes, I did that.

I do have similar bindings. But that's not what I'm looking for.
If there's no other way around it, I'll probably learn to use
'~vi<tab>' instead of '~vim<tab>'. :)
