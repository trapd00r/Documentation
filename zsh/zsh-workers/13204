I needed to quickly diff two files; what I did was

gdiff -u s/s/nssw/wb_TAB

that resulted in

bor@itsrm2% gdiff -u samba-2.2.0-alpha1/source/nsswitch/wb_common.c
Completing original file
wb_client.c        wb_common.c        wb_common.c.org    winbindd_cache.c 

I moved to wb_common and simply hit `{.org,}', that gave me command line

bor@itsrm2% gdiff -u samba-2.2.0-alpha1/source/nsswitch/wb_common.c {.org,}

note the space before `{'.

May be, it is misuse of completion - but I do it often in cases like above.
