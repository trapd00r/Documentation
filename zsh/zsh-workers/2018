That's mentioned about two pages down Etc/NEWS, but in the context of
globbing.  Globbing in assignments can be turned on with GLOB_ASSIGN,
but there's no option to do field splitting to generate an array.
You'll just have to use parentheses, which works with older zsh
versions anyway.

Zoltan: should GLOB_ASSIGN be extended to generate arrays based on
field splitting too?  Or do we now want to remove this option
entirely?
