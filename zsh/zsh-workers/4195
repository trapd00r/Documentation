Hi,

I've tried to compile zsh 3.1.4 on a HP-UX B.10.10 A 9000/712 with
egcs-2.90.28, and I had a little problem with the configure script. It 
detected utmp and utmpx to be defined by a system header, while this
doesn't seem to be the case, since I had to comment out these settings 
from config.h to make it compile.

After that it worked fine. I will track this down a bit and send more
information.

	Bye,
		Falk
