There's one other extremely minor problem with this.

I have my PS4 string set to begin with ": " and end with ";" because then
I can cut'n'paste xtrace output and the PS4 stuff is discarded as a `:'
command.  But with the parens in there around the `(eval)', I get globbing
errors when I cut'n'paste.

} Maybe we need to grab another prompt escape.

I was toying with something like %N{...}, where you could use other prompt
escapes inside the {...} the way you can use strftime escapes in %D{...}.

But really what we'd need is a %(X.T.F) sort of thing, where X is true if
you're inside an eval, so that one could write

	PS4='%(e.(%i:eval%).%N)... '

Except that then we'd also need a way for %i to specify that it's actually
the saved line number from the surrounding scope, etc. etc.
