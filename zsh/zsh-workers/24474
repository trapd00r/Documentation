The problem seems to come from the different formats of the "usage:"
line, so that the $usage variable in _subversion is wrong in the
svnadmin case.

vin:~> svn help help
help (?, h): Describe the usage of this program or its subcommands.
usage: help [SUBCOMMAND...]

Valid options:
  --config-dir arg         : read user configuration files from directory ARG

vin:~> svnadmin help help
help (?, h): usage: svnadmin help [SUBCOMMAND...]

Describe the usage of this program or its subcommands.
