I'm having a problem with zsh 3.0.5 on FreeBSD-stable.  Although the
arrow keys sometimes work, sometimes they just generate a bell and an
'A', 'B', 'C' or 'D'.

This reminds me of a problem that vi users often encounter.

I have experienced this on the console and in X.  If there's any more
information I can provide you with, please let me know.  Thanks!
