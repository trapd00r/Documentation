My current understanding of the situation is as follows:
bash, ksh, and zsh behave normally under glibc 2.3

under glibc 2.7, ksh behaves normally

bash does this
$ echo one >/dev/full
bash: echo: write error: No space left on device
$ echo two
one
two

and zsh does this
% echo one >/dev/full
echo: write error: no space left on device
one
% echo two
two

I can't reproduce this with a simple fprintf-ing to /dev/full.
