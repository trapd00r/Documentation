May be, you have heard about one. It is called Windows and (sometimes) runs on
x86 PC-compatible systems :-)

I checked bash and it behaves the same as zsh. On Cygwin bash is just as
ignorant about special Win32 names as zsh is. It does not mean we should
follow the suite - but, at least, we are in good company as it stand now :))
