Hi,

As the zshwiki's administrator, I'll be very happy if it can becomes the
main site for zsh :) If you're interest I can work to customize a
template for dokuwiki (for example http://syncid.org/ is also a
dokuwiki!).

And by the way, regarding how many space it requires, I can mirror the
actual main site.

Regards

ps: sorry to answer outside thread, but I don't have original references.
