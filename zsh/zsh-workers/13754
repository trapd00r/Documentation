Sorry, I lied about the bash version.  While I do have that rpm installed, I
compiled a newer bash release from source since then.  From bash --version:
GNU bash, version 2.03.0(1)-release (i686-pc-linux-gnu)

I'm fairly certain that pub/gnu/bash/bash-2.03.tar.gz on ftp.gnu.org is the
version I've got.
