This has been asked about before, if not discussed in any detail.  The
difficulty is that ZLE depends heavily not just on zsh utilities like
the heap memory manager but on the internals of the history mechanism
and command lexer/parser.  The latter is particularly critical to the
completion mechanism; programmable completion would be useless without
the contextual information supplied by the lexer/parser, and it would
require a significant effort to incorporate a programming interface to
allow other parsers to be used instead.

This is not to say that it's not possible, but I haven't heard anybody
announce that they're motivated to take it on.
