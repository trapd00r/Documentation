Subject: not running precmd - was: Re: PS1='%?'

while experimenting with displaying the previous command's return status 
as part of my prompt, i came across a test case that didn't work and made 
no sense at first:
 	return n>0

after some experimenting, i found that after running 'return', precmd is 
not executed. that kind of makes sense, but it still seems kind of buggy. 
should i think of this as a bug or an edge case that's a little over the 
edge?
