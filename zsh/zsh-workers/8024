Found this through mistyping #\a syntax :-)

% print $(( \#a ))
zsh: bad math expression: operand expected at `\#a '
zsh: 16508 segmentation fault (core dumped)  /bin/zsh

Here's another, maybe the same bug?

% (( 1 == #\M-/ )) && print yep
zsh: bad math expression: operand expected at `/ '
zsh: 17042 segmentation fault (core dumped)  /bin/zsh
