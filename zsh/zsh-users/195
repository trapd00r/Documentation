Hi,

between beta13 and beta14, the magic required to access directory
stack entries changed from '=' to '~' (i.e. 'cd /; pushd /tmp; echo
=1' was changed to 'cd /;pushd /tmp; echo ~1').  Was this an intended
change or merely a result of the code cleanup in subst.c?  It's at
least not mentioned anywhere (neither Doc nor ChangeLog nor README).
One effect is that the old '=-' for accessing the last pushed entry of
the stack is gone because '~-' is an alias for $OLDPWD.


    so long

	Norbert
