Hi,

I have a suffix alias "alias -s py=python". Now I can execute Python 
scripts by name that don't have a "she-bang" and aren't executable. 
That's great.

But now I noticed that I cannot execute Python scripts anymore that 
are placed in my path (/usr/bin for example) because zsh doesn't 
search the path anymore for the suffix alias.

Is there a solution for this problem?

For instance:
thorsten@cathedral% pwd
/home/thorsten
thorsten@cathedral% rst2html.py --version
python: can't open file 'rst2html.py'
thorsten@cathedral% unalias -s py
thorsten@cathedral% rst2html.py --version
rst2html.py (Docutils 0.3.6)

That's right - 'rst2html.py' isn't in the current working directory 
but in /usr/bin where the install put it.
