Subject: The test command
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii" ; format="flowed"

I propose this addition to the age-old test command:

   --verbose
        If the test does not succeed, print the reason why to stderr

The usefulness of this is shown in this example:

   if ! test --verbose -e "$file" ; then
     exit $?
   fi
