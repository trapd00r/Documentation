I've added a few things to my XML completion tool:

	1) Added a man page for help2simple.pl.
	2) Re-organized the help2simple.pl usage by  flag functionality.
	3) Added a flag to specify a getopt-style string to help2simple.pl.
		Which, allow you to tell help2simple.pl about single
		character flags, and whether they take arguments.

Hopefully the additional documentation will help other people understand
how to use these scripts a little more.

You can download the latest tarball from the webpage at:
