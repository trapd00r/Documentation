Hi all,

I'm writing a shell and I'm wondering if there would be an advantage
to trying to use zle instead of readline at least initially. My
impression is that it has a lot of additional features (multiline
editing?) that might be nice to take advantage of, but I'm not sure
how hard it would be to separate it from the rest of the zsh code.

Thanks,

Frederik
