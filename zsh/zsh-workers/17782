Oliver proposed a fix for the nc/netcat/nedit-nc confusion back in 16815.
It doesn't appear that anything ever came of it.  Or was there another fix
that I've overlooked?

Karl Tomlinson's termcap/terminfo segfault patch in 17482 got applied to
the 4.0 branch but not to the 4.1.0-dev trunk.  Is it not needed on the
trunk?
