I suspected as much, at least for the auto-suffx-removal stuff; after I
read largish portions of zshcomp*(1), I got worried ;)

Thanks a bunch for the help :) I appreciate it a lot.

P.S.: For the other poster to this tread asking why I needed it off, the
answer is: "I don't". I don't need it off, I want it off. I do a lot of
shell script writing for my work, and I do the prototypes live in an
interactive shell. Once I've poked it enough, I copy and paste it into
the shell script. Spaces around punctuation make things much more
readable. Have you tried to maintain a 50k shell script that wasn't
formatted nicely? :) I've just been having to go through re-editing the
paste, and it proves irritating. That's all. No "need" involved.
