Sorry, brain on hold.  zsh 3.0.4, Solaris 2.5.1, gcc-2.7.2.2, whatever libc
Sun ships withe Solaris 2.5.1.

Reproduced with zsh -f:

# pwd
/home/lsims
# zsh -f
lanshark:/home/sinclair# pwd
/home/sinclair

I've also checked to make sure both users have unique uid's and home dirs,
which both do.  Also, the auto_home file points correctly to two different
directories.
