What I do is two things: For commands that I never want to see in my =
history I make an alias for it that begins with a space character, like =
so:

  alias mkpwlink=3D' mkpwlink'

If the shell option histignorespace is set, the mkpwlink command will =
not appear in the history.

If I want to run a whole "session" of commands without history, I use =
the history stack:

  HISTSTACK=3D0
  alias histpush=3D"fc -p && ((HISTSTACK +=3D 1))"
  alias histpop=3D"fc -P && ((HISTSTACK -=3D 1))"

I use the $HISTSTACK variable in my prompt to keep track of my history =
level.
