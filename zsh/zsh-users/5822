i don't think so.  bash completers resemble the old completion style
with compctl much more.

exactly.  this is more a problem of documentation then programming,
because the facilities are already there.  i just got lost in all the
stuff.  the freebsd port maintainers put all the `_*' functions
containing zsh features at various levels into one single, flat
directory, so for me, who couldn't differentiate between widgets,
low- and high-level functions the interface layers were not clear.

but Borzenkov was nice enough to send me some pointers, so i think i
can take it from here.  thanks, Borzenkov!

zsh needs more documentation with elaborate examples, that's all.  i
know, it's the hardest part of it all ...
