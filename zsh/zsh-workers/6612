Any chance you could find out where in zsh's malloc() this is happening?
It's probably something like one of the structs m_hdr, m_shdr or heap not
having a size divisible by 8. I altered definitions of structures and sizes
to get this to work on one system (IRIX 6.2 with gcc), so there is some
compiler/system dependency here.
