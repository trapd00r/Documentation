Subject: Several "You have new mail." messages with zsh 4.2.6

With zsh 4.2.6 under Mac OS X, I have the following bug:

I retrieve my mail with getmail; it is stored to maildir folders.
But when I have new mail, I often get several messages
"You have new mail".

Note: $MAILPATH is unset, but $MAIL is set to my main mail folder.

I didn't have this problem under Linux (with zsh Debian package).
