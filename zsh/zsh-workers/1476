Yikes. I'm sorry. ;-)

(And you thought I was kidding when I asked if American Engish or British
English was to be preferred. :-)

Anyway, my 'working' copy of zsh.texi has changed much since the version
you are looking at (including many more spelling fixes) but currently has
too many tags and FIXME's for a patch to be posted right now, having taken

I have a couple of days before 3.0 is released ?

Clive.
