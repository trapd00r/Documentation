Thanks!  This is easier on the eyes in most cases than the standard 
zsh.vim.  I noticed one thing that was a bit odd, though.  Consider the 
following line:

${(M)${$(dscl /LDAPv3/127.0.0.1 . /Users/${USER} 
authAuthority)[(w)2]}#;*;}

Your updated file isn't confused by the final # like the standard 
zsh.vim file, but  it does color most of 127.0.0.1 a different color 
from the rest of the line.  I'm not sure how to go about fixing that, 
but if you ever do update your zsh.vim file, please post it to the 
list.

Thanks,
Ryan
