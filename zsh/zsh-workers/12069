It is not possible to install Zsh binary under Cygwin if another Zsh is
currently active:

/usr/src/zsh/mkinstalldirs /usr/local/bin
/usr/bin/install -c  zsh.exe /usr/local/bin/zsh-3.1.9-dev-1.exe
/usr/bin/install: /usr/local/bin/zsh-3.1.9-dev-1.exe: Permission denied
make[1]: *** [install.bin-here] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/build/zsh/Src'
make: *** [install.bin] Error 2

Any idea? Is it a problem of Zsh, Cygwin or NT? I recall recent
discussion on NTBUGTRAQ that under NT deleted files remain visible as
long as they are opened (as opposed to Unix where directory entry is
removed). It smells like this.
