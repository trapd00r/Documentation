Let's look again at Tomasz's pattern:

(#bi)($PREFIX:t)(?)*=00=$color[red]=$color[green];$color[bold]

It'd be very nice if there were a way to replace that "=00" with something
that means "everything left gets the color determined by the file mode."

Of course that assumes that we choose to make patterns take precedence over
file modes, see workers/25381.
