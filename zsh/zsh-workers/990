For me, mirror-2.8 works fine with perl-5.001m.

It can be found in

        src.doc.ic.ac.uk [146.169.2.1]
                directory: computing/archiving/mirror
                (shortcut packages/mirror)

        ftp.th-darmstadt.de [130.83.55.75]
                directory: pub/networking/mirror

        ftp.sun.ac.za [146.232.213.2]
