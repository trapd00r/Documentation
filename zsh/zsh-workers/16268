} That should obviously restore the original HISTFILE at the second last
} line.

Oops, well, yes, what's missing is that the second line should be

	local HISTFILE=$temphist

Originally I had that in the first `local', but then I decided to stuff
the name of the temp file into it's own variable rather than repeat it
twice, and then forgot to localize the assignment on the second line.
