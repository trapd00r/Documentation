Subject: RE: PATCH: Re: pws-10 RE: zsh-3.1.5-pws-9: _path_files  and symbolic links


I'm a bit slow today...

This uses `compgen' (i.e. the former `complist'), not `_files'. Was
the reason for this that `_path_files' didn't handle ignored prefixes
correctly? My big patch made `_path_files' give `IPREFIX' to `compadd' 
so this should work now.

Bye
 Sven
