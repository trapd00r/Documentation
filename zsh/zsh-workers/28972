Reply to message =ABunknown file attribute=BB,=20

by Manfred Lotz:

These are glob qualifiers: qualifiers `B' and `C' do not exist (that is why=
 you=20
see this error), but qualifier `A' means `group-readable files' and `D' mea=
ns=20
`set GLOB_DOTS option for the current pattern'. As there is no pattern then=
 no=20
files match it and zsh will behave according to its options:
1. If nullglob is set unmatched pattern is removed from argumnents list and
   `echo (A)' yields just a single newline.
2. If cshnullglob and nomatch are unset unmatched pattern is left as-is and
   `echo (A)' yields `(A)\n'
3. If either cshnullglob or nomatch are set then unmatched pattern prevents=
=20
command from executing and `echo (A)' will yield an error (either `zsh: no=
=20
matches found: (A)' if cshnullglob is unset or `zsh: nomatch' if it is set).

I suggest you to learn this glob quilifiers as they are really useful in so=
me=20
situations.
