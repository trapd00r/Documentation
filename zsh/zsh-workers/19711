It is easy for us to add `#ifdef __CYGWIN__' around changes or #define
O_TEXT to zero on other systems so if you do correct the problem,
please send the changes back to us.

It seems there is a setmode() function declared in io.h which will
allow the mode to be changed on any already open file descriptors.
