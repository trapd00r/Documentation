That's actually expected behaviour.  It's documented that aliases that
end with a space cause the following word to be expanded as an alias.
Since GREPCOLOR is empty, the alias for grep does end with a space.

You ought to do something like

  [[ -n $GREPCOLOR ]] && alias grep="grep $GREPCOLOR"

or

  alias grep="grep${GREPCOLOR:+ $GREPCOLOR}"
