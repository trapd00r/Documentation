As of the most recent CVS, every time I complete something which uses
_perl_modules to complete with, I get 

  _all_labels:34: command not found: -J

This could well be my faulty completion programming in _perl_modules,
but I'm afraid I haven't kept up-to-date with the many recent changes
so I have no idea how to fix it.

Also, _complete_help hasn't worked for me for a while now, e.g.

$ ls <TAB>
_complete_help:39: bad pattern: \n    all-files  (_files _default)
