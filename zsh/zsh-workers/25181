Well, the C language doesn't have a power operator (there's a power
function, with prefix notation, so no precedence problem with it).

Concerning the precedence of & and |, I'd say that zsh should do what
POSIX requires in sh emulation mode.

Also, when people don't agree about the precedence of operators, a
solution could be to require parentheses (but I don't know if this
is easy to implement such rules). At least ambiguity is avoided.
