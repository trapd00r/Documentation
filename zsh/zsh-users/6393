Can anyone tell me if any of the following can be done with zsh?

1.  assignments of the form:
      varname[word]=( [word]=word [word]=word ... )

2.  validating variable assigment using predetermined function.

3.  I would also like to be able to use reference variables.  This
      `feature' is a little less important since it seams that zsh has
      scoping capabilities (local vs. global).
