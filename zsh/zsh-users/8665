The -t flag tests to see whether an fd is open *and attached to a
terminal*.  So it's probably no good for what you need.

I think that the only way you could do this would be using the stat
plugin.

    % zmodload -i zsh/stat
    % stat -f 3
    stat: 3: bad file descriptor
    % stat -f 3 3</etc/hosts
    device  365
    inode   8285
    mode    33188
    nlink   1
    uid     0
    gid     0
    rdev    32807
    size    177
    atime   1113201458
    mtime   1100873702
    ctime   1100873702
    blksize 4096
    blocks  4
    link

You should be able to make that do what you need.
