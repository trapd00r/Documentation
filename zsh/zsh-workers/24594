Weird... that's the variant I wasn't expecting since it implies
a run time failure in iconv, and not a dynamical link failure, either.
That means this call failed (Src/utils.c:4878 in the current source):

    	    	    cd = iconv_open(nl_langinfo(CODESET), "UCS-4BE");
		    if (cd == (iconv_t)-1) {
			zerr("cannot do charset conversion (iconv failed)");
			CHARSET_FAILED();
		    }

Any idea if your iconv supports UCS-4BE?  GNU iconv will tell you with
"iconv --list", but if you have a Solaris variant it's likely to be
different.  Otherwise, could nl_langinfo(CODESET) not be returning
anything?
