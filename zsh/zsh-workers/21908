   For the Cygwin port, I'd updated Src/main.c to use a Cygwin specific
"feature" to force all read-only files opened by the shell to strip out
CRs.  This was necessary for reading shell scripts which might have been
created with dos carriage-control.
   Unfortinately, this only applies to read-only files (opened with
O_RDONLY), allowing for files opened for write to be influenced by the
filesystem settings.  Since the console stream is r/w, the above
"feature" doesn't apply.
   Since we are talking about console input, though, there may be a tty
setting to control weither CRs are passed to the input stream.  I'll see
if I can investigate this.
