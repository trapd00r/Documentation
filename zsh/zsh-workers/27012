Yes, that was my guess. Completion.

Since I don't use matcher-lists, I cannot comment any further. Compsys
experts will have to take on that one. :)

That's my point. CORRECT_IGNORE has *nothing* to do with completion.
It's about correction. That is precisely why I was asking about what
Richard meant by 'final goal', because the thread initially had
nothing to do with completion.

Final goal in completion - based on what you described - will have to
be solved within compsys.

Final goal in correction (for the problem I described), can be
achieved by what CORRECT_IGNORE provides. If someone wants more
control in _correction_ than that, that someone would probably have to
reimplement the correction code into a more flexible system (maybe
even function based - like compsys). But I doubt it would be worth it.

Could a compsys guru shed some light on this? :)
