I love Zsh, but is it the right tool for this job? If dependency or
contrib software minimization is a requirement, I'm not sure how Zsh got
picked. In the past, when I've only been permitted one tool to do a job
that a system's supplied Bourne(-like) shell wasn't capable of perform-
ing, I've chosen Perl. If that hadn't been appropriate, I would have
perhaps next chosen BusyBox:

    BusyBox
    (combines tiny versions of many common UNIX utilities into a single
    small executable, providing a fairly complete POSIX environment for
    small or embedded systems)
    http://www.busybox.net/

Everybody likes screenshots. Here's BusyBox's:

| $ ./busybox                                                                |
| BusyBox v0.60.3 (2002.04.27-10:33+0000) multi-call binary                  |
|                                                                            |
| Usage: busybox [function] [arguments]...                                   |
|    or: [function] [arguments]...                                           |

|     BusyBox is a multi-call binary that combines many common Unix          |
|     utilities into a single executable.  Most people will create a         |
|     link to busybox for each function they wish to use, and BusyBox        |
|     will act like whatever it was invoked as.                              |
|                                                                            |
