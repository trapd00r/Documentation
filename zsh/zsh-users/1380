This sounds suspiciously like the problem I reported a while ago when
my xterm would mysteriously disappear as I typed. The was a message
on the screen that I didn't have time to read but I am sure the
word .zlogout was in there. I have never been able to reproduce this
but it still happens very infrequently. BTW I am using an unpatched
3.0.5 on Solaris 2.6.
