well, I don't have the file part, but I use this

pid () {

for i in $*
do
        echo `/bin/ps -auxwww | grep -v grep |
        grep -w $i | awk '{print $2}' | tr -s '\012' ' '`
 
done

}

and then use it for something like

kill -HUP `pid sendmail`

but it doesn't have the nice expansion/matching stuff... more often than
not I know exactly what I want to kill.  Note my version is only going to
match exactly (grep -w) and is case sensitive.

I don't know if this is anything like you wanted, I'm just trying to
contribute rather than just always asking ....
