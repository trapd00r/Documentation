} We want something to be displayed instead of a listing.

Oh!  *I* didn't want something displayed instead of a listing; I just
wanted to be able to dynamically change the explanation.  It didn't
sink in exactly what it was you were implementing.

Given that, it all makes *much* more sense to me.

I hope it wasn't me you thought was treating your suggestion with scorn.
That wasn't my intention; I was just trying to find out why you chose the
implementation you did, but starting from a misunderstanding of what it
was accomplishing.  Sorry.
