Unfortunately zsh can get confused, especially with missing end quotes (my  
favorite error to make)... it can tell me the line number that's really far  
from where the open quote goes.

I've got all my complex functions (those which span more than one 70-char  
line) in separate files in a folder $ZDOTDIR/Functions/Complex/ for this  
exact same thing.... any problem with one doesn't hurt the others.

It makes things much easier, especially when you do several different  
changes in a row (as I seem to tend to do).
