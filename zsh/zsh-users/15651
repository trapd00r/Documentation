I've uploaded a test versions of zsh:

ftp://ftp.zsh.org/pub/development/zsh-4.3.10-test-3.tar.gz
ftp://ftp.zsh.org/pub/development/zsh-4.3.10-test-3-doc.tar.gz

If this seems not to be broken I'll turn it into 4.3.11, either early
next week or early in the new year if there turns out to be more to do.

I will then attempt to promote it to 4.4.0 shortly thereafter.  The
minor oddities to do with completion that need fixing aren't that
important and aren't likely to happen quickly.
