I dare say Mark will fix this.

Unfortunately, Mark does not have the latest working copy (with spelling
corrections) and will not have until I return home and upload it this
evening.

Yes, the above is wrong.  I will correct it when I return home this
evening before I upload the latest version to Mark.

This is a direct copy of zshcompctl.man.
Perhaps it needs to be clarified in the man page.

Again, this is a direct copy of the man page.

I did not set out to re-write the man pages, just port them to texinfo.
zsh.texi (at present) is a copy of the man pages in texinfo format with 
an expanded "Introduction" that includes the META-FAQ.

This is a problem with doubled single-quote characters ie. ''
They are correctly handled (@iftex / @ifinfo) in the source so I would
assume that the problem is with texi2html.
