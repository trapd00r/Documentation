Ah.  I tried it with the latest -dev version, compiled out of my CVS
sandbox.

If I try with 4.2.5, I get the same results as you.

I just noticed that, even in the latest build, if LC_ALL starts out set
(even to nothing), but not exported, then when "LC_ALL=C foo" is run
LC_ALL becomes and remains exported, even though its value gets reset
to the previous state.

I don't know what differs between 4.2.5 and the latest CVS that would
affect this.
