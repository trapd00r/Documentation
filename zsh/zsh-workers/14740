Yes, you have to
  cvs -d '<the-sourceforge-stuff>' checkout -r zsh-4_0-patches zsh
and apply it.

In general they shouldn't go straight onto the 4.0 branch until after a bit
of testing, but this one is presumably an improvement.  Bart's suggestion
is someone (probably me, it looks like) applies all the 4.0 changes, but
I'm not enthusiastic about doing it all myself at the moment.
