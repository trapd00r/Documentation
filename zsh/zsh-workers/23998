I recompiled zsh with --enable-zsh-debug and the attached patch, but
it crashed again at the same place, without any debugging information.
Again, this happened after a ssh that lasted several days, but this
time, I closed the connection with Ctrl-D.

If I understand correctly, the crash occurs here in preprompt():

        /* The PROMPT_SP heuristic will move the prompt down to a new line
         * if there was any dangling output on the line (assuming the terminal
         * has automatic margins, but we try even if hasam isn't set). */
        char *str;
        int percents = opts[PROMPTPERCENT];
        opts[PROMPTPERCENT] = 1;
        str = promptexpand("%B%S%#%s%b", 0, NULL, NULL);
        opts[PROMPTPERCENT] = percents;
        fprintf(shout, "%s%*s\r", str, (int)columns - 1 - !hasxn, "");
        free(str);
