I had problems with the tilde test (below, if it means anything --- part of
the problem is my /etc/zshenv which isn't as clean as usual on my PC), but
it seems clear that zpty is functioning OK, so I'm committing the two
changes (with the #ifdef __CYGWIN__ for now).

By the way, we probably need to be clearer about tests that might fail on a
network mount.
