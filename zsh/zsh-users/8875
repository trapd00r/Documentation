Hello,
Is there a way to ask for confirmation here? It's not always history
contains what you expect, for example if you share history and just
ran rm -rf . in another terminal, and press this bind you might not be
so happy with the outcome. Ie something like
zsh: are you sure you want to run $history[$((HISTCMD-1))] again? [yn]
Is the read builtin what i want? I never quite got the hang of that one.
