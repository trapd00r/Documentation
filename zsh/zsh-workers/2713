What's even worse,

% echo executing command unexpectedly... \

internal:  uncompleted line in history
executing command unexpectedly...

Probably ^D shouldn't behave like EOF within zle unless it's the first
character on the first line of input only.  After all, it's expected
to behave like a continuation of the current line, not a new line.  I
think the following patch fixes the behaviour.  It's so simple I can't
help wondering if somebody removed the isfirstln before for some reason?
