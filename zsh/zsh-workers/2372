When I rewrote the Makefiles, I spent a good deal of time trying
to find a portable way to handle the conversion for K&R compilers.
In the end, my conclusion was that using the _file.c makefile rules
was the only way to go.  Nothing else was portable.  The only
alternative would be to require people to have GNU make (which has
the ability to do some fancy rules based on pattern matching).  I would
be against this.  The current way of using _file.c makefile rules is
simple and portable.  I don't see any need to change it.
