The list management software (qconfirm) also uses SMTP Envelope Sender
to test for membership and does not understand BATV envelopes.  Other
mailing-list managers use Sender:/From:/etc and so are unaffected.

A result is that I'm having to individually confirm every message I
send.  So I send less and start feeling frustrated any time I want to
post to zsh-workers.  I'll have to confirm this post before anyone else
sees it.

On May 1st (2009) I mailed staff@dotsrc.org to ask about this;
dotsrc.org appears to be the new name for sunsite.dk, etc.  I've had no
response.

Does anyone have any contacts with sunsite.dk that can get this fixed?

Thanks,
-Phil
