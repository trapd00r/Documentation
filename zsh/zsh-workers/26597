I've reported the following bug on

  http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=516998

POSIX.1-2008 says[*]:

  2.3.1 Alias Substitution
  [...] However, reserved words in correct grammatical context
  shall not be candidates for alias substitution.

[*] http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/V3_chap02.html#tag_18_03_01

but zsh gives:

vin% emulate sh
vin% alias !="echo OK"
vin% ! foo
OK foo
vin% 

instead of running command "foo". ksh93, pdksh, dash and bash
in POSIX mode all behave correctly.
