You have a problem with understanding the order of evaluation.

%(#.true.false) is evaluated only when a prompt is printed, not at
other times when variables are interpolated.  What's happening is that
the value of $fg[%(#.magenta.green)] is looked up at the time of the
assignment to "host" -- and there is no key "%(#.magenta.green)" in the
$fg associative array, so that returns nothing.  By the time the various
remaining %-expandos in the PS1 and RPS1 strings are interpreted, it's
too late.

What you need is:

host_color="%(#.$fg[magenta].$fg[green])"
host="%{$host_color%}(%m)"
warninfo="%{$host_color%}^^ ROOT ^^ "
