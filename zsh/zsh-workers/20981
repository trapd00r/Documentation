Currently, there are a lot of modules marked as link=dynamic, which
means that they are unavailable when the shell is statically linked, or
when --disable-dynamic is specified.  Changing them all from
link=dynamic to link=either doesn't add that much to the executable
size, and ensures that modules are always available when requested:

  OS           dynamic  either

  FreeBSD 5.3  1364036  1455012
  AIX 5.2      1207448  1360814  
  Solaris 10    923180  1000104

Could this be made the default (link=either instead of link=dynamic)?
