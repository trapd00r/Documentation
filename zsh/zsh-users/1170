----------

Hello:
	I have the ZSHELL in my HP C160 ws, and I have a couple of questions: 

1.- How can I put my time zone in order to obtain the correct hour with "date" command?
2.- Can I customize my z-shell in the sense of obtaining  the date and the system messages in spanish (with cshell it was by means of the LANG environment variable)

	Thanks a lots in advance.
