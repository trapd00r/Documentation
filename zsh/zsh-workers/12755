Um, really. Which is even worse.

By definition, INTERACTIVE is set "if the standard input is a tty and commands
are being read from standard input". In the above case standard input is not
tty and commands are not being read from standard input.

Well, I am concerned now how to prevent all definitions from .zshrc to be used
in subshell. I definitely do not want that (ls foo| ...) use my alias for ls;
and I do not want window title be mangled. Any idea? Is it possible to provide
"clean sandbox" for subshells?
