Forgot to include the documentation that mentions this:

       The following flags (except p) are followed by one or more
       arguments as shown.  Any character, or the matching pairs
       `(...)', `{...}', `[...]', or `<...>', may be used in place of a
       colon as delimiters, but note that when a flag takes more than
       one argument, a matched pair of delimiters must surround each
       argument.
