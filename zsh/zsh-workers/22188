Might want to strip out IPv6 addresses as well:

  -e '/^[0-9a-f]\{0,4\}:/d'

And I'm not sure I see what the "/p" is doing there, other than doubling
each entry.  Would

    ${${${(u)${(f)"$(<~/.ssh/known_hosts)"}%%[ ,]*}:#(#s)[0-9]##.[0-9]##.[0-9]##.[0-9]##(#e)}:#(#s)[0-9a-f:]##(#e)}

be any better (if more arcane)?
