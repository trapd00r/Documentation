Use Explorer to associate files with extension, i.e., .zsh, with the zsh.
I have two actions associated with it - Edit and Run; Edit invokes pfe32
on the script, Run just runs it ( you point to your current zsh.exe
location for this to work ). 

>From CMD you can run zsh scripts by specifying the extension:

C:\ >  script.zsh

The trouble now is you apparently can not pass any parameters to the
script, therefore you might resolve to using 'read' for them in the script
itself.  Any ideas here?
