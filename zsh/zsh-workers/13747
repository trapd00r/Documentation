I don't really understand why it is "correct somehow". It seems to occur
only with options ending in a colon and there shouldn't be anything
special about the colon, only that if not quoted, it would mean
something different. Isn't this _arguments failing to account for the
quoting somewhere? Or is 13725 fixing this?
