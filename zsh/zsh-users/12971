Hi all,

I am using setopt shortloops, which allows me to do

  for i in *; echo $i

Along the same lines, I would want to be able to do

  while true; echo this is neat


Is there any reason this is not possible? Is it an oversight? Could
something like this be added at some point in the future?


Richard
