In this particular case, you don't need it, since return will function
like exit in a script.

I've thought of a hack which is pretty much guaranteed to work (I
think):

  foo=global
  local foo >/dev/null
  if [[ $foo = global ]]; then 
    print At top level
  else
    print Inside a function
  fi

The nasty bit is the `local foo' which prints the status of $foo if it
already exists.  I keep thinking we ought to do something about that.
