Actually, don't worry - they are not using your server name. Everyone got
their own domain in the From: header (I got:
	From: twoheartsofgold.com@mailgw1.technion.ac.il
). I'm not sure why that happened - apparently some mailer on the way, either
the mailing list program or our own mailers, so a From: without a "@", and
decided to stick the local domain at the end.

Anyway, how come such spam is distributed to the mailing list? Is it open for
posting for non-subscribers?
