You mean function symbols?  Variable symbols are easy, the definition can
just be shifted.  For the rest, if it can't be simplified it should
probably be left.  I was wondering about the possibility of defining the
pointer to the list of thingies in comp1, and calling any of those via the
list.  But that doesn't seem to cover very many.

However, if it's not going to work there's no point compiling complist.
There needs to be a warning much earlier on, or we need to suggest building
zle into the shell.
