} Adding SIGERR as an alias where there's no system signal is trivial.
} Now it should show up in the trap lists under ERR, too.  I've removed
} the ALT_SIGS definition because there isn't really any justification for
} making the mechanism optional now.

I just discovered another reason why we use ZERR:

In file included from ../../../zsh-4.0/Src/Modules/terminfo.c:53:
/usr/include/curses.h:195: warning: `ERR' redefined
/usr/include/sys/ucontext.h:74: warning: this is the location of the previous
definition
