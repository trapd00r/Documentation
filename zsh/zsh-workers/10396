} The program we use at work does cope with commits spanning multiple

I almost never mention *any* files or directories on the command line.
I just "cvs commit" (implicitly recursively) from the top-level dir.

I often find myself editing the commit message at each directory to be
specific about what's changing in that set of files. Aggregating by the
process ID of the originating cvs process, rather than by time, would
be far more useful.
