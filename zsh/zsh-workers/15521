Part of the point about a number of the things that were mentioned was
not that they're suitable for standardization, but that they should be

I don't see any significant omissions or mis-inclusions on your list as
strictly a list of the things that might be standardi[sz]able.

I don't want it to drag on either, but because I think we need to send
off our list to DK et al. as soon as possible.  Either the ball is not
