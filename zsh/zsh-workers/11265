Yes, this is valid response (just look through cvs source :-) The problem
is SOCKS - I once compiled cvs with SOCKS5 and lost modifications. Now I
tried to do it once more - without success; I tried it both with 1.10 and
1.10.8 with basically the same results. Obviously, something more is
needed than just including socks.h and compiling with -DSOCKS.

When I'm back, I probably try to make real patch for CVS+SOCKS stuff
=2E.. currently, I just restored old copy that works.
