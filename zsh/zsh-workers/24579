} You're invoking $fndir/Misc/sticky-note with a full pathname?

No ... my point was that

cp $^fpath/sticky-note(N) ~/bin
chmod +x ~/bin/sticky-note

is a lot less of a PITA than

cp $^fpath/sticky-note(N) ~/bin
vi ~/bin/sticky-note
O#!/bin/zsh -fiESC:wq
chmod +x ~/bin/sticky-note

especially given that it's non-obvious that "-fi" is necessary in order
for it to work correctly.

It's entirely possible that there's a better place than Functions/Misc/
to put scripts like this, but that place doesn't exist yet in the tree.
