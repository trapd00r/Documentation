It isn't. Perhaps it could be done the same way as _kill?
One other issue is that killall also behaves differently :

- On Debian (and probably most Linux distribution) it kill
  process by names;

- On Solaris, Digital Unix, RISC/os and maybe others, it kills
  *all* actives process and thus completing with process name is
  inappropriate.

Maybe there could be two _killall in Zsh ?  Let's say one in
Completion/User/_killall and one in Completion/Linux/_killall.  Then
./configure and Makefile would be hacked to install Linux/* only on
Linux system and in such a way that Linux/* functions would overwrite
previously installed User/* completions.  Look quite ugly :(
