OK.  I'll try to do that this weekend when I have some time.  Maybe
you'll have thought some more about the next item, and the formatting
issues of insert_positions will be decided.

That hadn't occurred to me.  It does seem like it would be useful in
other situations to know if the current string is equal to one of the
matches.

To add even more information about insert positions, it might be useful
to know if a given insert position can match a null string or not.  For
example, if the choices are A.C.D, A.B.C, A.B.C.D, and the input is A.C,
it might be useful to know that the insert position after the A, for
some matches, doesn't need any input.

I've been using the latest changes all day and haven't had any problems.
Thanks again, Sven!
