} this is rather long standing. I do not see any easier way to fix it.

In Test/ztst.zsh is

# Ensure the locale does not screw up sorting.  Don't supply a locale
# unless there's one set, to minimise problems.
[[ -n $LC_ALL ]] && LC_ALL=C
[[ -n $LC_COLLATE ]] && LC_COLLATE=C
[[ -n $LANG ]] && LANG=C


Perhaps this just needs LC_NUMERIC added?
