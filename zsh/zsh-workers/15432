Subject: PATCH: bash-transpose-words
Date: Fri, 20 Jul 2001 11:49:55 +0100
From: Peter Stephenson <pws@csr.com>

This one I definitely plan to use, I've been frustrated by the other one
too often.

Now what I'd really like is for the cursor to stay at the point between the
words it's transposing instead of hopping around after it, but that
requires either doing the whole thing in a shell function, or some trickery
with marks --- which I still don't trust if text has been moving around,
but I haven't analysed what I don't trust well enough to suggest what needs
fixing.

 These work similarly to the corresponding builtin zle functions without the
 `tt(bash-)' prefix, but a word is considered to consist of alphanumeric
 characters only.  If you wish to replace your existing bindings with these
 four widgets, the following is sufficient:
 
 example(for widget in kill-word backward-kill-word \ 
-forward-word backward-word; do 
+forward-word backward-word transpose-words; do 
   autoload bash-$widget 
   zle -N $widget bash-$widget
 done)
