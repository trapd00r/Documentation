Thanks for investigating.  OK, so that has to come out for openbsd.  I hope
the following patch does the trick:  it's a bit complicated in order to
ensure we get the definition before any system header files.

Clint, can you remember why we needed _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED for curses.c?
We should at least document it.  This seems to have been there since the
start.

It should now be OK not to use --with-term-lib (and to ignore the previous
patch): it looks like this is ultimately picking up the same files anyway,
and I'd like to be sure it compiles without special options.

Thank you.
