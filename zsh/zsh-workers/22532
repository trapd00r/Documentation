} I don't see why one should work rather than the other, but the first
} thing to check is rlimits.h.

Patch was posted to RedHat's bugzilla:

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/attachment.cgi?id=115795

This looks like it's related to workers/20728 and workers/20816, except
that there's also a change to (if I read it correctly) allow a double
leading underscore on the RLIMIT macros.

That's also a year old, so why RedHat hasn't included it in any of the
several quarterly updates since then, is something of a mystery.

I still don't have an answer to why the autoconf perl modules aren't
working.
