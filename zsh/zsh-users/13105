linux on some fairly new enterprise server hardware. i don't think
it's the machine's fault. :)

ah, looks like it's part of compaudit

+compaudit:84> IFS=: +compaudit:84> read GROUP _i_pw _i_gid GROUPMEM

is it trying to do something like read all users/groups from the
authentication system for completion? that might explain it, as our
directory server is 10,000 miles away. if that's the problem, is there
a way to get rid of it without having write access to the /etc/z*
files?
