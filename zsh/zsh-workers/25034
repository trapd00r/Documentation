Debian has been shipping this in the global zshrc, which could lead to
the situation you describe.

zstyle ':completion:*:sudo:*' command-path /usr/local/sbin /usr/local/bin \
                             /usr/sbin /usr/bin /sbin /bin /usr/X11R6/bin

I have all the sbins included in my $path, so I've never noticed.
