Cool.  I ended up with the following in my ~/.zshrc:

_xmake () {
    if [ -r ./ENV ]; then
        . ./ENV
    fi
    _make "$@"
}
compdef _xmake xmake

It seemed to be too small to put it anywhere else :-)  Amazingly
enough, I already had a function and a compdef call; I just hadn't
thought that I could just call the existing function _make...  D'oh.

Thanks a lot!

Kai
