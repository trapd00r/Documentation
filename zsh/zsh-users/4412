Ooops, Sorry I was reading the man page, and right after I sent this
email, I saw the restricted shell section.  I have another question:

When I setup a restricted shell for a user, and let's say I put
PATH=/r in his .zprofile and /r contains no binaries, he is still
able to execute certain commands (like echo, pwd, export, etc).
How can I restrict the execution of those commands as well?

Also there are programs like pine that allow users to break out of
restricted shells.  Any tips on how to limit that as well?

Thanks for the prompt reply, and any help ;-D
