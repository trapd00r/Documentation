Hi!

I just recently switched from tcsh to zsh and I really like it!
But there's on thing I can't get the way I'd like it:

I want to bind to ^P a widget that acts like
history-beginning-search-backward, but always moves the cursor to the end
of the line, like history-search-backward does.  Or said the other way:
I want history-search-backward to look at more than the first word.

Do you know a way to get this behavior?

Thanks a lot in advance,
 Andy.
