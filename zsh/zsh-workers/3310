I have installed 'zsh' and tried it a little, also read a bit of the
manual and it seems very powerful.

But I can't seem to get "dircolors" to work with it.

It does not pertain the color settings from "tcsh" underneath, and
also when doing "eval `dircolors`", the eval inserts "setenv" and
stuff that "zsh" does not understand.

Do you know how I can make "zsh" give different colors to files,
directories, links, file types, etc?

I'd be grateful for any assistance.
