Subject: _rsync duplicated options in completion
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0205151349520.26901-100000@phong.blorf.net>

I've noticed that the _rsync completer duplicates most (all?) of the
options.  For instance, if I type "--include-f<TAB>" it lists one with
a description and one without, but won't complete the option name any
further.
