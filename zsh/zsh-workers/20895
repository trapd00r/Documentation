Suppose you have

  alias LL='ls -lL'

Do you want run-help to display the man page for "ls", or do you want it
to simply fail because there is no LL command?

However, it's probably possible to rewrite the run-help function so that
it skips command prefixes (coproc, nice, time, etc.) in alias expansions
and displays the help for the following word instead.
