Looks OK to me.

} If this syntax is being developed, it seems weird that it's deprecated.

The syntax isn't really being developed (except for my cshjunkietests
suggestion, which I put forth because I used to be a csh junkie).  What
has happened is that a special case to *reject* an otherwise reasonable
syntax has been *removed*; this is deconstruction, not construction.

} Does anyone really want to get rid of it?

Just before 2.5.0 was released, there was a big push among some of the zsh
maintainers to remove csh-like features from zsh in favor of faithfully
emulating ksh.  That faction no longer seems so vocal, probably because
zsh is now a more complete superset of ksh, so the fact that some extra
non-ksh syntax is available is less noticeable.

} If so, fine.  But if the sentiment is that these forms should be
} available without setting options

That isn't quite an accurate depiction.  These forms work for the same
reason that this kind of thing works:

	if true ; ; ; then
	    echo bash or ksh would give a syntax error on ';'
	fi

Zsh permits things like empty commands in a "list" syntax element and
other unambiguous combinations because it makes for a simpler parser.
It's actually more work in most cases to reject it than to accept it.

} shouldn't they:
}   a) be supported;
}   b) not be advised against in the manual?

I'd be all in favor of that.
