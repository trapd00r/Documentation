Subject: Overriding a yank* widget in zle

I'm trying to figure out how to override the zle yank widget without
breaking the ability to use yank-pop, and this does not appear to be
possible in the current code.  A query in early 2005 on the subject went
unanswered, so hopefully I didn't miss some simple solution to this.

I've coded up a patch that adds the -y option to zle so that I can define a
"zle -Ny yank" widget (as well as yank-pop), which marks it as being a
ZLE_YANK equivalent.  I'm not sure that this is the right solution, so see
what you think of the change.
