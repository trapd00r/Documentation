See the zshcompsys manual page.  The simple way to start is
"autoload -U compinit; compinit".  The patch I posted is for the lastest
version of zsh; I've committed a change to the 4.2 branch to the archive.
You probably need at least 4.2.something for any half-way reasonable subversion
completion.

Once the system is installed as above, it will find completions for
subversion automatically.

Same answer.  There's just the single step for activating the entire
system.  There are lots of configuration options using "zstyle", however.
