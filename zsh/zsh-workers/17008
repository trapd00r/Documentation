Subject: datasize limit when building zsh
X-Mailer: VM 6.97 under Emacs 21.0.106.1

Hello, 

I need to increase the datasize (limit) when building zsh because it
is set to 2047MB by default. 

Is this a zsh config option or a OS option (I'm on Solaris 2.6 but
there is nothing in /etc/system about this).

I tried searching on zsh.org but the search server was refusing
connections and google produced nothing useful.

What file do I modify before I build zsh with a higher datasize limit?
