    But it's treated like a file on the master side (well, sort of),
especially with "zpty", that's why I didn't even think about
translation problems.

    I forgot about STTY parameter, sorry O:) And I didn't noticed, in
the zpty info page, that the parameters were run as in an eval
command, sorry again O:)

    Thanks for the help, Bart. You're really great :) If you keep on

a house XD
