Thanks.

I prefer inline patches if your mail system doesn't mangle them:
experience suggests anything to do with Microsoft is likely to ensure
plain text is messed up in some way or another (no matter how many
attempts you've made to tweak Outlook or Exchange).  Attachments are
always fine, however, in any case of doubt (patch even handles DOS line
endings, thought that's a bit baroque).
