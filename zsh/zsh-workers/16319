You can always delete the functions you don't want or, probably better,
create a link farm in a directory pointing to all those functions you want
and then put only that directory in you $fpath before calling compinit.

And of course, for those places where you don't want to complete: just don't
hit TAB there. For the things you like doing your own way you can also write
your own functions or use compdef to make _default be called there. (Unless
you tell us more exactly what and where you do or don't want whatever, we
can't help you much more than this, I think ;-).
