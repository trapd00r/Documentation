I tried to look around if perhaps other shells implemented a similar feature,
and what syntax they had used.

I found one implementation in a shell called psh, the parallel shell, also
known as (amusingly :-)) "the Pourne Shell". The syntax they used is this:

# Do 4 jobs concurrently
set -j4 
# same as a for loop, but pays attention to the j flag.
pfor i in 3 5 11 21 8 9 13 7
do
	...
done

The only trace I can find of this shell on the Internet, however, is this
page in Google's cache:

Nadav.
