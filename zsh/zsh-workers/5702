After applying last patches (5696-5699) I get some strange results:

1. bor@itsrm2:/tools/src/zsh-3.1.5-pws-11%> ./configure --pre<TAB>
bor@itsrm2:/tools/src/zsh-3.1.5-pws-11%> ./configure --pre44
fix=

2. l ~/.z/C<TAB>
    Beep
~/.zsh.d/Completion exists and was correctly completed before a couple of
last patches :-)

3. (I think, it changed recently)

./configure --e-d<TAB>
./configure --enable-dynamic <^Xu> (bound to undo)
                             ^cursor here (one blank after line)
./configure --enable-dynamic <^Xu>
                             ^cursor still here
./configure --e-d

Well, IMHO ``--enable-dynamic '' (including blank) was inserted in _one_
step and should be removed by _one_ command as well. And it was the case at
least with 3-1.5-pws-10.
