Running with current CVS (including last patch from Peter) gives me:

! MESSAGE:{arg}
Test /tools/src/zsh/Test/53completion.ztst failed: output differs from
expected as shown above for:
 comptesteval 'compdef _tst tst; _tst () { _arguments "-x" ":arg:" }'
 comptest $'tst -\t'
Was testing: _arguments
/tools/src/zsh/Test/53completion.ztst: test failed.

I cannot say, if it failed before, because output may have been scrolled
away.

This is in addition to cursor positioning problem (this consistently
fails here).
