I know this is dumb, and I know I've asked before, and I know I should be  
able to figure it out.

Ignorance, expressed, I'll still ask:

if I want to make a loop to go from 0 to 100, how do I do that?

for i in 0-100; do
	echo $i
done

but the "0-100" part is the part I can never remember....

ps -- what is this actually called, so I can possibly find it in the man pages ?
