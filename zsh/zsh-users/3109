So far I've learned that zsh-3.1 is very stable, contains a dosen of new
features and deveoped since a couple of years.

May I suggest closing the 3.0 series declaring it "obsolote" -- no more
bugfixes in it, and "freezing" the 3.1 series to a distibutable package --
probably with versioning 3.2.*.

It would have the advantage that the "development" and "stable" series would
have a smaller Eucledian distance, facilitating the patching of both versions.

I'm only a humble user so I haven't got any word here.  It's up to you, dear
developers.

Thank you for listening.
