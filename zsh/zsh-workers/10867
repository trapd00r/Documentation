Okay, I've added the AIX completions. I've cited 10857 as the patch -
there didn't seem any point in resending them in a proper patch although
I actually made a few minor changes (using _wanted without &&).

What about completions for other applications which are not system
specific but are not going to be of much use to most people. For
example, I have a number of completions for Rational Apex commands.
Maybe we could have an Apps directory which could contain further
directories for such things as Apex and also things like rpm maybe?
