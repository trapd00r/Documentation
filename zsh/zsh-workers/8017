I don't know what you had in mind, but it occurs to me the major potential
use of that sort of math function is with keywords.  For example,
$(( limit(coredumpsize) )) could return the appropriate limit, with MB's
and KB's expanded out in this case.  That would be quite neat.

if (( limit(coredumpsize) == 0 )); then
  print "Warning:  programmes will not dump core" >&2
fi

But I'm sure someone else will have fun writing such things.
