Right, that's why I stuck with + there; you've got to guess if
something's a delimiter, which adds a non-quite-obvious bit to the
existing delimiter rule.

If you've got Z you don't necessarily need z+ as well.  I was trying to
avoid using up yet another letter, but once you do there's no great need
to do anything with the original one.
