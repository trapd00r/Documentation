Two main differences:

1) matcher is tested for the most specific contexts possible,
   including the tags, matcher-list, as you said, only for the
   completer

2) matcher-list uses its values on after another (there is a loop),
   matcher uses all its values in one go

But, yes, with completer-labelling one could replace matcher-list with 
a couple of matcher styles settings. Exactly because of that `couple of'
I kept matcher-list -- it's so much more convenient.
