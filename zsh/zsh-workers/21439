I really don't understand what you're trying to say here.  Are you
saying that defaults are hard to get right, as the ones that were being
set messed up your environment and made Zsh work in a way that you
didn't expect it to, to the point that you had to use the word "heck"?
Why do you think that the defaults that are being set are going to make
life easier for Zsh-converts?

The global RCs shouldn't really be doing very much anyway, in my
opinion.  On my system they set ZDOTDIR and a default PATH, that's about
it.  I do agree that having completion set up properly by default would
make Zsh a lot more appealing at first glance, but completion can be
quite difficult to set up to a default that suits the largest number of
converters,
