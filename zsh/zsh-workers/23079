Subject: problems in zshcompctl.1, zshcontrib.1, zshmodules.1

This is automatically generated email about problems in a man page for which
you appear to be responsible.  If you are not the right person or list, tell
me and I will attempt to correct my database.

See http://catb.org/~esr/doclifter/problems.html for details on how and
why these patches were generated.  Feel free to email me with any questions.
Note: These patches do not change the mod date of any manual page.  You
may wish to do that by hand.

Problems with zshcompctl.1:

1. List syntax error. This means .IP, .TP or .RS/.RE markup is garbled.
This confuses doclifter, and may also mess up stricter troff
interpreters like Xman, Rosetta, and TkMan.
