this seems to work:

_cvs_existing_entries() {
  local expl match linedir realdir files disp
  match=()
  : ${PREFIX:#(#b)(*/)(*)}
  linedir="$match[1]"
  realdir=${(e)~linedir}
  [[ -f "$realdir"CVS/Entries ]] &&
  disp=(${(@)${(@)${(@M)${(@f)"$(<"$realdir"CVS/Entries)"}:#/*}#/}%%/*})
  files=( ${linedir}${(@)^disp} )
  (( ${#disp} )) && _wanted files expl file compadd -d disp -a files
}

except it now breaks when 'linedir' contains a parameter substitution,
presumably the whole reason for the 'realdir' logic above, because the
'$' in the parameter substitution gets escaped with '\'.  But
presumably adding '-Q' to compadd would break completing files that
contain characters that need to be escaped.  Should I do that, and
escape characters that need it in $files?

Otherwise I'm running out of ideas; maybe I should look into why
whitespace in file names was not handled before Peter's change in
2003.
