In zsh 4.1 there is a -w option to _values that will fix this. _values
isn't as good as I'd like. The issues were discussed in depth in
relation to _dd if you want to search the archives for it.

I think you've misunderstood what -s to compadd does. -W and -g are
options to _files and not compadd.

How you should write it depends on whether you want to complete
subdirectories along with .pf files. If not,
  compadd ${BASEDIR:-/usr/local}/${area}/conf/*.pf(:r:t)
should do it.

That's what you told it to do in the line:
   compadd -qS = -a area_dirs

At least in 4.1, your -s = argument to _values is redundant. -S specifies
the separator between values and their arguments (default =) while -s
specifies the value separator.
