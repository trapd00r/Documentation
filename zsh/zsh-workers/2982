zsh can't really do anything about this.  It's the kernel that doesn't
distinguish between these two error conditions.  zsh could, I suppose, try
to stat(2) the executable if execve(2) returns ENOENT, but it's a kludge.

It's been discussed, but there are some major issues to be overcome.

The new `clone' module can do this.  With a couple of enhancements, it
could be very useful for purposes like this.
