I've played with it for a little without success.

I've come to the conclusion the only way to do it will be to rewrite it
internally exactly how you've shown it --- i.e. insert a current-shell
construct (the normal effect of braces) inside the list construct and
attach the redirection to that, but it's a bit of a mess unless we
always parse functions as a current-shell construct.

Maybe later.
