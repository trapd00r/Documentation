Of course -- totally forgot.

It is when trapping SIGINT and SIGTERM, it says unknown signal. SIGQUIT
and SIGSEGV are not problematic..

_From the bash manual (2.05):
SIGNALS
       When bash is interactive, in the absence of any traps,  it
       ignores  SIGTERM (so that kill 0 does not kill an interac­
       tive shell), and SIGINT is caught and handled (so that the
       wait  builtin  is  interruptible).   In  all  cases,  bash
       ignores SIGQUIT.   If  job  control  is  in  effect,  bash
       ignores SIGTTIN, SIGTTOU, and SIGTSTP.
