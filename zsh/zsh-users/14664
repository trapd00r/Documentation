I suppose some of these aren't returning a status indicating they've
failed.  You're right, of course, that if so it's a bug but it's also a
pain to track down (since most people wouldn't notice if they don't
expect anything else to be completed there).  This sounds rather hard to
track down *completely* automatically.
