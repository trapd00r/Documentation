If I press TAB on empty line, nothing happens. Yes, I remember, it was
done on purpose for normal command line completion (to avoid listing all
system commands), but nslookup just have a couple of dozens commands -
and I do not remember all of them :-) So, is it possible to turn on
completion in this case?
