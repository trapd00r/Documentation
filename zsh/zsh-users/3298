Does someone know any good elisp-file that would implement major mode for
editing of zsh-scripts with emacs? Even vi-clone called Vim has own mode for
Zsh, but emacs does not have it, yet.

Or how about creating one? Maybe it could be based on ksh-mode, that comes
with XEmacs. Here is its first lines:
