The problem is with _perl_modules.  It expects all commands for which it
complete to be synonyms for perl; it's attempting to run

	foo -e 'print @INC'

to find the include-path for the modules to complete.  When foo does not
exist it falls back to

	perl -e 'print @INC'

but when foo does exist and does not behave like perl, it simply fails.
