Hi,
	My name is Dan Norris and work as a Unix Systems administrator. I have =
a request to install zsh for a user.=20
I have down loaded and installed a HP-UX 11.0 version of zsh shell. I =
can not get the backspace or delete keys to function in zsh.
Tried setting stty erase `^H` < /dev/ttyconf. This is set, but backspace =
and delete still does not work.=20
I have tried a pre-compiled version of zsh (Version 4.0.4 and 4.0.6) and =
have compiled myself from source and neither works. Same problem.=20
This same version works fine on Solaris.
Any suggestions?


Thank you,

Dan Norris
