I'm kind of down on bin_notavail anyway.  It's pointless compiling the
module if it's not going to provide anything.  Failing to load it
with zmodload is a much more transparent way of finding that the
feature isn't available.  Otherwise, you're lulled into a false sense
of security about something which could fail to work in a lot of
different ways --- as in this case, we're not always concerned just
with builtins.  These multiple possible failure modes are asking for
trouble.
