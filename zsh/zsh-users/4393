Hi all,

question #1 from a newly-converted bash-user:

I can't get my histfile to work. I have put these lines in my .zshrc:

HISTFILE=~/.zsh_history  
HISTSIZE=5000
HISTFILESIZE=5000

setopt APPEND_HISTORY
setopt EXTENDED_HISTORY
setopt HIST_IGNORE_DUPS
setopt HIST_IGNORE_SPACE
setopt HIST_REDUCE_BLANKS


But this doesn't seem to work; my histfile never gets started. When I
exit zsh, no file is created or written to. What am I doing wrong?

TIA,

Jesper
