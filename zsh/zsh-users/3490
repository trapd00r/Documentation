The `exit value of exit command' is defined in second sentence that was taken
from the description of exit command. This is `n, if specified'. That is, exit
status of command `exit 59' is 59. Actually, this makes sense - it sets $? to
59 and exits shell, leaving it with `exit status of last command'.

Of course, Unix standards are known to use the most obscure wording possible.

The last command executed was `exit' not `false'. So, the above is a bug in
any case - exit status is either 0 or 59 (depending on exit status of exit ...

Well, it adds to functionality in any case; and youor example IMHO counts as
bug. sh and ksh scripts do not expect this anyway and won't be broken. But
there are more chances that bash/ash scripts will run properly.
