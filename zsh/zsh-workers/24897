With the new pattern isearch thingy, if i search for whatever and
press ctrl-r a couple of times, it finds older items as it should, but
when i press backspace, it seems to somehow erase the ^r going forward
in history again. I would expect it to just delete the character right
away...

Actually it seems like the non-pattern isearch behaves in the same
way, but somehow i never noticed it. The reason i found it now is i
was experimenting with the new color hilighting and typed ?(#c10) but
wanted to change it to ?(#c80) after pressing ctrl-r a couple of
times.

Is it a bug or a feature? :)
