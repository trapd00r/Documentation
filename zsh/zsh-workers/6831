I've just put in Sven's, since it's simpler and it does the job required,
which is getting the names of widgets.  The one I sent is still in the mail
list marked as `deferred', which suggests it hasn't been trying very hard,
and I've deleted all the patches on the disk here due to chronic disk space
shortage, so it may have gone now anyway.
