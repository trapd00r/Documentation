} On the subject of releases (as opposed to CVS revisions), what is the
} situation with 3.0.8?

I have a couple of issues that came up after the prerelease to resolve.
I should just get busy and resolve them, sigh.  They are:

The locale globbing thing.  I missed that it had already been changed in
3.1.6+, because I was expecting the strcoll() in glob.c to go away too.

The "read -q" bug that Sven patched in 10727.

The <n> == <n-> globbing thing that Zefram patched in 10444.  I'm tempted
simply to not deal with it, but  the "initial digit gets swallowed" bug
bothers me.

The "no such job" problem as discussed in 10016.
