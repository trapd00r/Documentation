I am running xemacs-21.1.14 but that is a behavior I have noticed in
shell-script-mode for years.  I do not have regular emacs installed
right now to test, but it was always my understanding that both emacs
and Xemacs mostly use the same lisp libraries for the different modes.
I will test again the next time I upgrade Xemacs.
