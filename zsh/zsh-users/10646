At least with gnome-terminal and putty,

bindkey "^[[Z" reverse-menu-complete

makes shift+tab cycle in reverse order. The inverse binding I'd like is
shift+control+r to history-incremental-search-forward to complement
control+r for history-incremental-search-backward, although I did find out
^S (although it's currently used for XOFF) and ^Xs are bound to it.
