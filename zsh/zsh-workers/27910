Yes it is. I used LC_ALL here because that was the only one that made "svn
info" switch to English when default locale is set to "fr_FR.utf8".

% LC_ALL=3DC svn info    =20
Path: .

% LC_MESSAGES=3DC LANG=3DC LC_CTYPE=3DC svn info
Chemin=C2=A0: .
[...]

I had not tested what non-ASCII encoding became, and you're right that the
shell can't handle utf-8 anymore.

% LC_ALL=3DC svn log =20

So setting LC_ALL=3DC globally is indeed a bad idea. But why not just local=
ly in
VCS_INFO_get_data_svn? I don't think that behavior would hurt much vcs_info.
The only problem I can think of is when the repository name is not un ASCII,
and doing this really calls for troubles ;-)
With a "fran=C3=A7ois" repository and LC_ALL=3DC:
% vcs_info command ; vcs_info_lastmsg                         =20
$vcs_info_msg_0_: "svn:(franfran=C3=A7ois37ois:1) "

The other solution would be to use the line numbers to fetch the data from =
"svn
info".
