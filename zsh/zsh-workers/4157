I've been meaning to mention that I think menucompletion and listings should
evaluate -all- the alternatives in an alternative completion, not just the
first one that happens to return something non-empty.

I realize that the current behavior permits one to avoid evaluating a very
slow completion until all previous alternatives have returned nothing, but
it's misleading to have the menu or listing omit some possible completions.
