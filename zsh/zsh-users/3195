    Thanks. I don't know both preexec and periodic before, it is very
    usefull to know for my other stuff. But preexec is a bit expensive,
    and periodic does not really fit well since I only really need to
    update the proxy settings once.

    Thanks again. This is my perfect solution. Putting an extra line
    killall -USR2 zsh in the ip-up script made it all happen.

    Also, I am just wondering, are all these features unique to zsh, or
    other shells have got them as well?

    Thanks.

Shao.
