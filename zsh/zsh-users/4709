Dominik does seem to be correct.

I have
	"^N" history-beginning-search-forward
	"^P" history-beginning-search-backward
	"^[OA" up-line-or-history
	"^[OB" down-line-or-history
	"^[[A" up-line-or-history
	"^[[B" down-line-or-history

ie ^P and ^N bound to the history-begining-search-* versions and the
arrow keys on my keyboard bound to *-line-or-history.

When I'm in a multi-line command ^P does try to search back in the history
which is what Dominik is seeing.

This doesn't worry me because after using ^P to get the multiline command
I wanted I naturally swap to using the arrow keys to edit it.

I'm using zsh version 4.0.4.

Is there an easy way for Dominik to add this 'up/down-line'
functionallity using the widget stuff?
