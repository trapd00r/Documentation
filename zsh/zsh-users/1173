I recently saw a post concerning zsh 3.0.5 unexpectedly
terminating.

I am also seeing this.

To reproduce:

# cat ~/.zshrc | more

 < Hit "q" for quit >

zsh terminates

If you type:

# more ~/.profile

 < Hit "q" > 

everything works fine.

I am running a "clean" install of zsh 3.0.5.  I have not
applied any patches.

Regards,

John
