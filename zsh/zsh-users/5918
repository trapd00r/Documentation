The completion for ssh uses ls -F on the remote machine to get the files
and then takes trailing *, =, |, / and @ characters to be the characters
added by ls -F to indicate the type of the file. I don't tend to have
file names ending in those characters and find it useful that it does
this. The ssh completion should perhaps honour the list_types style but
it'd still need ls -F to be able to do add `/' suffixes for directories.
