While I'm sending lots of emails, I think `we' (i.e. Sven) should just go
ahead with adds and removes.  We don't use the history enough to make this
too annoying --- and the history isn't lost, just a bit sequestered.
Bart's idea of a global tag first is sensible.  At the worst, you can then
check out that version of the completion functions and look at the history
from there.
