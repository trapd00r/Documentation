Greetings,

After reading the manual and the user's guide, I found that in
order to get case-insensitive completion everywhere, one would use:

zstyle ':completion:*' matcher-list 'm:{a-zA-Z}={A-Za-z}'

That works fine indeed, but what if I want case-insensitive
completion only for files?  After reading about contexts and
fiddling with C-x h, I figured that

zstyle ':completion:*:all-files' matcher-list 'm:{a-zA-Z}={A-Za-z}'

should do the trick for at least echo and some other general cases
(but not for example cvs), but that does not seem to affect
anything; if I have file ChangeLog in the current directory and I
say `echo cha<tab>', I don't get `echo ChangeLog'.

Then again, the more I look at output of C-x h for various
commands, I think I don't want to alter matcher-list for all-files
tag even if it worked but for all stuff that _files function
handles.  Perhaps.

In any case, how would I get matcher-list working with contexts
that specify a tag or with a function such as _files that is used
to generate completions in a specific context?
