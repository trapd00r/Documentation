$ZTST_testdir is where we are running the tests.  Unfortunately this will
break if you are compiling separately from the source tree and then running
individual tests in the test directory, which is quite useful since you
don't need to insert lots of paths.  It's not a big problem since you're
`supposed' to run it via make in the appropriate Test subdirectory, and
actually I can't see an easy fix anyway.
