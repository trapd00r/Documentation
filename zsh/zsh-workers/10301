} Damn. That doesn't work, because the printing functions just output
} `foo "$@"' for the not-really-existing call.

And the    [[ -o kshautoload ]] || foo "$@"   trick doesn't work if we
were to really emulate that ksh behavior, either, does it?

} Hm. What are we supposed to do here? Handle positional parameters
} differently?

For now, I think the answer is:  Handle positional parameters like zsh
always has done for kshautoload (as you pointed out in 10298) and fix
the problem of accurately emulating ksh at a later time.
