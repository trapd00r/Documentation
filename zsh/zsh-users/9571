    Hi Ronald :)

    That version you're using is pretty old, but I personally doubt
the here docs are broken, because that's heavily used and any bug in
that particular part of the shell would have been spotted rapidly.

> #!/bin/zsh
> cat << EOD
>   xxx
> EOD

    This prints "xxx" for me in 4.2.5 and in 4.0.9 :?

    I don't know. Do you have here documents in any script in your
system (working heredocs, I mean)? Then the problem may be in your
startup zsh scripts, but I can't think of where :??? The problem is
weird.
