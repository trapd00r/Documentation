Yes, it's not completely comprehensive but it's quite good at testing low
level stuff.  (The major weakness is interactive features; we need a
pty-based test harness for that.)  After building the shell, run "make
test" in the Test subdirectory.  Either all tests should pass, or you
should see a plausible message why a test wasn't executed or actually
failed on a given platform.
