Hmm.  Why not just append _files to the completer style, so that file
completion is always tried if everything else fails?

In fact, why not this:

    _unquoted_files { compset -q; _files }
    zstyle ':completion:*' completer _oldlist _expand _complete \
	_match _ignored _approximate _prefix _files _unquoted_files
