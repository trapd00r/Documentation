I can't reproduce the seg fault but valgrind says:

==12379== Invalid free() / delete / delete[]
==12379==    at 0x40047262: free (vg_clientfuncs.c:180)
==12379==    by 0x808ED08: zsfree (mem.c:1399)
==12379==    by 0x8075A15: freehistdata (hashtable.c:1517)
==12379==    by 0x80759B4: freehistnode (hashtable.c:1503)
==12379==    Address 0x80C995A is not stack'd, malloc'd or free'd

It gives line numbers if that is any use beyond what Clint has already
sent.
