Hello,

This is with zsh as packaged by cygwin.  

~=> zsh --version
zsh 4.3.9 (i686-pc-cygwin)
~=> x==(echo hello); ls -l $x
ls: cannot access /tmp/zshLYRlmE: No such file or directory

The alternative earlier package is 4.3.4, which is fine

~=> zsh --version
zsh 4.3.4 (i686-pc-cygwin)
~=> x==(echo hello); ls -l $x
-rw-r--r-- 1 ajrh None 6 Dec 11 06:08 /tmp/zsh7IfKiD
