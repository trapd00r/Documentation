Haven't you seen the flame wars on lkml every time someone asks for
one?  Debuggers don't really help.

Korn shell has some fairly sophisticated degugging facilities.
Perhaps reading up on them will point you somewhere useful?  They're
likly supported in zsh.

No tool is perfect for every job.  Perhaps you're using the wrong
tool.
