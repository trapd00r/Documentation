--enable-multibyte is more conventional. "with" options are meant for
enabling support for things that use external components.

Although including zle in the name as Peter suggests is accurate at the
moment, I assume that we'd not want multiple options once multibyte
support is added to other parts of the shell.

Seems right for my system too.

I think so. Unless you want --disable-multibyte to disable \u and \U.
Note that \u and \U could be useful even in a non-multibyte locale.
