Colour escape sequences are also avaliable from termcap/terminfo
databases, although they are rarely documented even for colour capable
terminal types. So colour can be added quite generically, with no
special hacks (setopt use_ansi_colour, although you might want a
setopt use_colour). And somehow you need to specify what colours mean
what.

Personally, I think this can be implemented best in compctl, e.g. If
you complete with the following rule, colour the completed word to
colour x.

Doesn't sound too hard either....
