Subject: zsh POSIX_TRAPS option


Hi,

Regarding the POSIX_TRAPS option, I can't help but wonder if making a
difference between f() { ... } (POSIX functions) and function f { ... }
(ksh functions) instead of adding more and more options would make
things less complex. In ksh93, ksh functions have their own traps, while
POSIX functions share the invoker's traps.

ksh93 does not support function f() { ... } (a stupid bashism), but mksh
does, treating it as a POSIX function.
