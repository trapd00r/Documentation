I have dynamic loading disabled on cygwin, which builds fine.  However,
running install insists on making the .dll (for which I probably need a new
dllwrap anyway).  So there may be a dependency wrong.  Unfortunately, I
don't have time to clear everything away and start again from scratch to
check (which isn't ropey but is very slow).  Seems to come from `make
install.bin'.
