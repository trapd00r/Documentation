The problem is that zsh/zle is a prerequisite, but zsh/deltochar does
not "know" that.  Which is strange, because there is a "moddeps" line
in deltochar.mdd.

schaefer<508> zmodload -d zsh/deltochar
schaefer<509> zmodload -d zsh/complist 
zsh/complist: zsh/complete zsh/zle

It must have something to do with "link=dynamic" or "load=no".  Anyway,
this means that loading deltochar doesn't automatically pre-load zle
the way that (e.g.) loading complist does, so you'll have to load both
yourself.  Which should happen in .zshrc, not .zshenv -- you don't need
these modules for non-interactive shells.
