Er, no, you misunderstand.  Placing a ^ after the $ *means* "turn on
the option for this one expansion only."  The option *is* off, under
all other circumstances, when emulating sh or ksh.

Zsh does not alter its parameter expansion (variable) syntax, except
for using 0-based vs. 1-based arrays, even when emulating.

This is not "a csh abomination."  Csh does nothing of the kind.  It's
been standard zsh syntax for quite a long while now, and only zsh has it
that I know of.

Then let's not bother info-cvs with any more of this thread.
