Sorry, I could find it in the FAQs althoug it should be a common problem.
On my machine (SGI,IRIX6.1) I often get the error "zsh arg list too long".

Last time I only tried   rm  ~/.netscape-cache/*
and it failed because there were (only) 576 files (filename length 24)

Is this a general restrictions of my OS or is ZSH configurable to allow
longer parameter lists?

Thank you for your help,

Helmut Jarausch.
