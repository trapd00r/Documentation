    Sorry, my fault. You cannot select a keymap and bind a key at the
same time. Anyway, since you already did 'bindkey -v' the 'viins'
keymap is selected so the key binding is placed in the appropriate
place.

    Just one more question: do your 'alt-.' key combo works the same
as 'esc-.'? Here I only can do the 'esc-.' combo, the alt-. doesn't
work because I don't have any action defined for 'alt-.' in my keymap
(I use Linux). Just curiosity O:)
