Well, if you really almost never use job control you can "unsetopt
monitor" until the occasion when you actually need it... but note that
that will unhide any job you didn't actually disown, so swapping between
the two modes isn't particularly helpful.  In other words, turning off
the option doesn't actually stop the shell recording jobs, only
reporting them.  I've a vague feeling this is supposed to be a feature.
