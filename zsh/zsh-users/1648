	this is probably just going to show my colossal cluelessness, but is 
there an easy way to get a zsh script to read from standard input?  i have a 
script that i'd like to convert into a cgi, but that means that rather than 
reading input from a file, i'd have to have it come from stdin.  i tried a 
"while read ... ; do ... done" loop with no redirection of input, but that 
didn't seem to work right.  what am i missing here?
