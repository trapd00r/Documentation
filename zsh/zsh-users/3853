I just tried building zsh on Solaris 7 from the latest source off of CVS.
Sun's compiler doesn't like inet_aton and inet_pton being declared as static.
Here are the errors:

"./zftp.pro", line 4: identifier redeclared: inet_aton
        current : static function(pointer to const char, pointer to struct in_addr {union {..} S_un}) returning int
        previous: function(pointer to const char, pointer to struct in_addr {union {..} S_un}) returning int : "/usr/include/arpa/inet.h", line 52
"./zftp.pro", line 6: identifier redeclared: inet_pton
        current : static function(int, pointer to const char, pointer to void) returning int
        previous: function(int, pointer to const char, pointer to void) returning int : "/usr/include/arpa/inet.h", line 54
