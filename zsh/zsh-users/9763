Version 4.2.6 of zsh has been uploaded to ftp.zsh.org/pub and to
Sourceforge.  The changes are minor: mostly bugfixes, with a few
enhancements to completion functions.

In case you haven't been following development, you should be aware that
a development version 4.3.1 will be released soon (before Christmas,
unless I get really tied up) which will contain support for multibyte
character sets such as UTF-8 in the line editor (though there's not yet
not much support in the main shell).  This appears to be working quite
well already.

(4.3.0 was the version number used during initial development on the
branch, so doesn't correspond to a release.)
