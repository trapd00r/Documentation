} Hmm.. How zsh searches command when I type 'sudo <TAB>'
} It will be better to get $path from that logic.

That just calls _command_names, which doesn't do anything magical at
all; in fact I'd expect it not to find modprobe if calling modprobe
later will fail for path reasons.  The path needs to be set where I
set it in that patch, before any completers are invoked.

} But it's not very difficult.. ? (:

It means dismantling the simple _arguments call into something that uses
state transitions to capture values as each argument is examined.

I don't believe that's worth the effort (it's certainly not worth *my*
effort, as I'm perfectly happy with the way it's been working for the
last seven years).
