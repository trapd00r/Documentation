The info files go in a directory named info. Usually something like
/usr/share/info or /usr/local/info. You'll have zsh.info and a few
other numbered files starting from zsh.info-1. They can be gzipped to
save space. You may need to point to the info directories using the
INFOPATH environment variable.

In zsh, you might use something like:
  typeset -Tx INFOPATH infopath
  infopath=( ~/info )

Each info directory has a file named `dir' which serves as a sort of
menu. If you have installed GNU texinfo, you can add an entry for zsh to
this file with something like the following command:
  install-info --info-dir=/usr/local/info /usr/local/info/zsh.info

Then you need a program to view the files. GNU texinfo comes with a
standalone program named info to do this. I don't like it and tend to
use tkinfo instead. There are other options such as the gnome help browser
(which seems to insist on a huge font) and one built-in to emacs.

The other option is to use the HTML version of the manual.
