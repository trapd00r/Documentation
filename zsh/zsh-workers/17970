Hm.  All right.  I suppose if I'd gone a step further and started
hitting tab to complete to one of them, I would have noticed that the
"a/" would have been inserted.  But the list "1 2 3 4" at "..//" just
looked wrong.  Maybe "a/1 a/2 a/3 a/4" instead?

Anyhow, thanks; I've now set squeeze-slashes.

Yeah, I've been seeing this for some time -- since 3.1.x at least, I'm
pretty sure, but I don't have a copy around to check -- but have always
blown past it too fast to have noticed what exactly it was that
triggered it.
