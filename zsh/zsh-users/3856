} I just tried building zsh on Solaris 7 from the latest source off

} declared as static.

Those declarations should be used only if HAVE_INET_PTON and HAVE_INET_ATON
are not defined.  Obviously you do have them, or at least you have a header
that declares them, or you couldn't have the conflict in the first place.

So the real question is, why are HAVE_INET_{A,P}TON not defined?  Was an
old config.cache used, or is there a library missing from the link that
is needed in order for configure to find them?
