Looks fine to me.  Are you going to handle 4.0.2?  It probably stands a
better chance of working.

It would be good to get the AIX changes out of the way.  Andrej, you've
been keep track of this better than me, has Timothy Miller got the latest

I don't think we should necessarily wait up for the IRIX problem, there's
no sign it's really under control at the moment.
