1. The manual says that array elements are numbered beginning with 1
unless the KSH_ARRAYS option is set. But actually array[0] works fine
and seems to be a synonym for array[1]. Bug or feature? This has the
great disadvantage that you cannot rely on "$array[i,j]" always being
empty if j < i.

2. There is an inconsistency in the behavior of the expression

   ${a:h}

which is said to give the "head" of $a. If a=x/y/z, the result is x/y;
but if a=x, the result is x. My understanding of "head" is that the
result in the latter case should be empty. Again: Bug or feature?

Regards,
	Bernd
