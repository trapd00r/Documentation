} Sorry, it looks like I made a bit of a mess of this when trying to
} simplify it. My original used $terminfo.

Does that mean that with $terminfo you were able to employ a destructive
backspace?  As I said, for me \b isn't destructive, at least not in the
sense of making it impossible to mouse-select previously-printed spaces.

The next complaint, of course, is going to be that zsh clobbers the word
"RIGHT" in the following:

zsh% echo -n "${(l.COLUMNS-6.. .)}RIGHT\015LEFT"
