Maybe you want something as simple as the following?
ls -Ssh -- **/*(.)
That'll sort all the files in descending size order and show the
sizes. It will sort _all_ files by size, not just internally sort in
each subdirectory, maybe that was what you wanted and then this won't
help. Also obviously suffers from the too many arguments possibility.

ps
sorry if i messed up the cc and/or to fields, gmail really doesn't
want me to use mailing lists. When i hit Reply, it just replies to the
last person and not the list, and when i select Reply To All it puts
the person in To: and the list in Cc:, I'm not sure what I'm expected
to do, don't use mailing lists a lot.
