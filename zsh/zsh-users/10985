Is it "named directories" you are looking for ?                            =
                                                                 =20
ex : I have :                                                              =
                                                                 =20
hash -d doc=3D"/usr/share/doc"                                             =
                                                                   =20
in my .zshrc, and cd ~doc always puts me to /usr/share/doc                 =
                                                                 =20
Take also a look at CDABLE_VARS option                                     =
                                                                        =20
                                                                           =
                                                                 =20
It's not exactly what you are asking, but may be it could help.            =
                                                                 =20
                                                                           =
                                                                 =20
