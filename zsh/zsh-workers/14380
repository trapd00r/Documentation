While I was waiting for that drive to check (it never did succeed, sigh)
I wrote up the test script for the zmodload command and committed it.

Currently one of the tests fails:  After defining an autoloaded math func,
you can't undefine it again, even if the module has not been loaded.  It's
probably something incredibly simple, but I'm not up to pursuing it right
now, so if you want "make check" to pass you have to comment out the line
`zmodload -uf bogus'.
