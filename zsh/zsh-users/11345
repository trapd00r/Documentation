}  How can I make the script act like the commandline ?

The script is not reading your ~/.zshrc et al. files (except for the
~/.zshenv file) because it is not an "interactive" shell.

If you have "setopt" commands that you want to apply to all shells,
move them to ~/.zshenv.  In this case it's "setopt GLOB_DOTS".

However, a better idea in this case would be to use

	print -l **/*(D)

which turns on GLOB_DOTS just for this one file expansion.
