Thanks for the extra info... I think there is an extra line here (to
make six characters of four bytes each) but I'm already a bit worried
because the first character appears to be a NULL which should make the
length zero.

... and also an extra five lines here (making 64 bytes)

With a bit of luck the history file will tell me enough: it will needed
to be synced with the internal history; if you use incappendhistory or
sharehistory it automatically will be.  If it's OK it would good to get
that (you can send it to me directly).  What are you typing after ^R to
get this to happen?

It would be preferable to sort this out before making a release, if
possible, and I'm on holiday for two weeks from tomorrow, so it might be
best if I make another dev release (incorporating the Solaris fixes)
today.
