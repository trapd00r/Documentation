I'm glad you answered zzapper's question because I was scratching my
head over why it made a difference if the bzip'd file was also tar'd.

}  "instance" of extension ("tar.bz2" instead of "bz2") from "$afile"

You mean e.g. ${${(M)afile%%(.tar|).(7z|bz2|gz)}#.} except that you
don't want to have to enumerate (7z|bz2|gz)?  Otherwise I'm not clear
on the question.

Incidentally if it's important to know about the "tar" part, then have
you considered what to do with e.g. ".tgz" files?
