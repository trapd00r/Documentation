Well, going to the start and using down-case-word (ESC l in Emacs mode)
until you get to the end is the obvious way.

But it's not hard (after you've worked out the offsets, anyway) to write
a widget that transforms the region---I hadn't realised there wasn't
one:

  down-case-region() {
    emulate -L zsh
    integer p1 p2

    if (( CURSOR < MARK )); then
      (( p1=CURSOR+1, p2=MARK ))
    else
      (( p1=MARK+1, p2=CURSOR ))
    fi
    BUFFER[p1,p2]=${(L)BUFFER[p1,p2]}
  }
  zle -N down-case-region

Unfortunately ${(L)...} and parameter indexing don't handle multibyte
characters yet, so down-case-word, which is implemented internally,
should be safer.  You could use some kind of hybrid.
