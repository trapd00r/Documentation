Just occured to me: people don't need to repeat the patterns, of
course, as long as they use their own little naming convention for the 
tags they invent:

  zstyle ... tag-order --foo=files --bar=files
  zstyle '*-foo' ignored-patterns '*.ps'

Or maybe ':completion:*:-foo' or something like that. Onewould only
have to make sure that either

- these tag names are not used more than once,
- or (better) they are used consistently wherever one wants the
  behaviour configured for the tag (avoiding multiple tags with the
  same styles set for them)

Anyway, I'll first get the other stuff done and then we can discuss
(and play with) ways to make the style setup easier.

Bye
 Sven
