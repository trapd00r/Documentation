What has it to do with cdpath? _path_files completes partial file path; it is
used by many other completion functions, _cd including.

I do not understand. _path_files basically evaluates

/path*/to*/dir*

so unless you try to complete something like

/cd/some/path/file

/cdrom will never be touched. Can you give specific example of what you try to
do? Together with zstyle -L output.
