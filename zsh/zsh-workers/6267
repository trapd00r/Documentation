Subject: 3.1.5-pws-18 (NeXTStep) fixes some globbing problems


(FWIW: I had to build 'zsh' with 'cc -posix -traditional-cpp'
	I think I had erroneously reported not using any special
	flags previously.)

OK now I don't get this at all

This now works:

# echo /*s*
/LocalApps /NextApps/ /Users/ /drives/ /lost+found/ /usr/

# echo /*
/LocalApps /LocalLibrary /Net/ /NextAdmin/ /NextApps/ /NextDeveloper  
/NextLibrary/ /Users/ /bin/ /dev /drives/ /etc /lib/ /lost+found/ /mach  
/mach_kernel /mach_kernel.OS42 /mach_kernel.nonY2K /private/ /tmp /usr/

# ls /U[tab]
# ls /Users/[cursor here]

OK so that's solved.... EXCEPT this (seemingly identical problem) still exists:

# ls /drives
IBM3/      kickdisk/  win95/

# ls /drives/[tab]
# ls /drives/kickdisk/[cursorhere]
# echo /drives/*
/drives/kickdisk/
# echo /drives/*i*
/drives/kickdisk/
# echo /drives/*B*
zsh: no matches found: /drives/*B*

# mount -p | egrep 'kickdisk|IBM|win'
/dev/rsd0h	/drives/win95	vmount-353 default	0 0
/dev/sd3c	/drives/IBM3	4.3        rw,noquota	1 2
/dev/sd0a	/drives/kickdisk	4.3        rw,noquota	1 2

Any guesses?
