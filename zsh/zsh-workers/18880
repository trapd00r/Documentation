I don't think the parameter module should be showing unset parameters
when you ask it for a list of parameters which are set.

I can't show up the bug with braceexpand, which is probably something
different.  There was a bug fixed back in March:

	* 18325: Src/Modules/parameter.c: options on by default weren't
	handled correctly.

but I don't think that's it either.
