I was trying to set up completion control for scp like this
% compctl
scp -f -x 'n[1,:]' -K RemoteFileList - 'p[1,1]' -k '(tuomo@jymy: tupyhala@zonex.cop.fi:)'
i defined function like this
function RemoteFileList { hname=`echo $1 | cut -f2 -d '@'`; reply=(`ssh
$hname ls`); echo - $1 - $2 -}
[last echo for debigging purposes]. It seems that function isn't getting
parameters as it is told in man page. Is this a bug, or is it feature? If
i have misunderstood documentation could me point me how to do this then.

I'm running zsh shipped with RH4.2 (3.0.2) on Linux-i586.

TIA
