I should point out that it's possible for sysconf(_SC_OPEN_MAX) to return
zero even when the actual descriptor limit is greater than OPEN_MAX.  So
there is still potential for zsh to leave high-numbered descriptors open
in closeallelse() et al., should the OS have a particularly brain-damaged
POSIX implementation and someone really wishes to force it.
