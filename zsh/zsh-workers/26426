If you are defining function in a *zsh* script, why not simply define it=20
as *zsh* function?

While I see usage cases for sourcing file under specific emulation (and=20
probably making it "sticky" for functions defined in it), I really do=20
not see why would you want to define a csh function in a zsh script.

Actually you can always do

foo=3D$(<<-\HERE
 	function foo {
 	 ...
 	}
 	HERE)
emulate -c sh $foo

Assuming this is supported by zsh internals it is trivial to add option=20
to emulate to set "sticky" bit during code evaluation.
