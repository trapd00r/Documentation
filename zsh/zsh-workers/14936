} Why it does not complete the last part?

I sort of explained that back in 14218, with the patch that made it work
even that far:

The problem is that to complete the file name, it needs to look at the
CVS/Entries file, but until the directory has been completed it can't
possibly know _which_ CVS/Entries file to examine.  Even if there's only
one possible directory, there's no way to extract that information from
_path_files in order to use it to find the Entries file.
