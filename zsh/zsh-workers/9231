I vaguelly remember, Zefram changed zmodload so, that it works the same way in
dynamic and static builds of zsh.

Is it possible to compile in all modules in static versions and use zmodload to
enable/disable them at runtime? In this case, xmods.conf would list modules
enabled by default.

Or is it already the case?
