I have an enhancement request for zsh:

When piping a series of commands, e.g.

cat X | sort 

zsh apparently only lets you access the error status of the last 
command in the pipe; I need to know if any command in the pipe 
has failed.  

(Bash will let you access the error codes for any command in the 
pipe as an array, which is overkill for me--I just need to know if any 
of the commands returned a non-zero value.)
