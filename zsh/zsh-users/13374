This fails to compile on Solaris 11 with the Sun Studio 11 compiler, with
the following error:

    "zle_refresh.c", line 1796: operands have incompatible types:
             const struct  {long chr, int atr} ":" struct  {long chr, int atr}
    cc: acomp failed for zle_refresh.c

With SS12, this is just a warning.

I believe that by the time I get around to putting 4.3.7 into Solaris,
we'll have switched to using SS12 (if we haven't already), so it won't be a
problem, but it might still be a useful data point, if anyone out there is
using SS11.

Thanks,
Danek
