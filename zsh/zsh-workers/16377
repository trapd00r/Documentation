Subject: Can not complete automounted directories

I have network shares automounted under /net/<system>/<sharename>.
So, for example, on my workstation I have access to a filesystem
located at /net/mithril/opt.  The filesystem is actually mounted at
/.automount/mithril/root/opt - automount puts a nicer path on the
front end.

Using the new completion system, I can not complete files under
/net/<system>:

zsh -f
zion% echo $ZSH_VERSION 
4.1.0-dev-3
zion% echo $MODULE_PATH
/usr/local/zsh-2001-12-22/lib/zsh/4.1.0-dev-3
zion% ls /net/mithril/opt/b<TAB>
successfully completes to /net/mithril/opt/build, but

zion% autoload -U compinit
zion% compinit
zion% ls /net/mithril/opt/b<TAB>

just beeps.

zion% ls /.automount/mithril/root/opt/b<TAB>
completes correctly to 'build'.

I find this behavior both under 4.0.4 and zsh built from CVS sources
on 12/22.

'uname -a' reports: 
Linux zion.rcn.com 2.4.8-34.1mdk-smp-acs #2 SMP Sat Dec 1 14:47:30 EST 2001 i686 unknown

Please let me know if there's any more information needed to debug
this problem.

Thanks,
  vin
