Well, first: you can always use expansion for things like this. Then:
The problem is that we would suddenly have to deal with paths with
different numbers of components. The easiest way to implement
something like this which I can currently see is to have _path_files
try */, then */*/, and so on, up to a configuarable maximum number of
components. But if you have a/foo and a/b/foo, this would only
complete the first one.

Bye
 Sven
