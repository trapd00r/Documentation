Subject: Problems with the functions[] parameter
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

I think that wordcode storage of functions has messed up the function[]
assoc from the parameter module.  The value of functions[something] no
longer accurately reflects the current state of the function `something'
and assigning to (or using vared on) functions[something] no longer
changes the definition of `something'.
