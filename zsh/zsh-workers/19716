I can believe that adding ifdef's to all is ugly. That's what I meant
by "#define O_TEXT to zero on other systems" - just one thought on a
possible more "elegant" approach.

Are the diffs just the line endings? From what I understand, the
reported problems were with text files used as input to the shell (i.e.
scripts, sourced files, autoloaded functions and stdin). Quite whether
it is also right for redirected output, I wouldn't know.
