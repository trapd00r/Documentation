Hi,

Hi thanks 2 whoever 4 these 2 binds


bindkey -M viins '^O' copy-prev-shell-word
bindkey '^L' push-line # push current command into a buffer


the push-line allows you halfway thru a command to temporarily break-away 
and type and excute another command, you then automatically return to the 
command you were editting

You WANT this!

& your best binds? (Much binding in the Marsh : Obscure cultural 
reference))
