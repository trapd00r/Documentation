The patch below fixes both of the observed problems with REC_EXACT (one
of which was present in beta10 and probably earlier betas too).  The
problem of the completion prefix being inserted a second time was due
to a missing invalidatelist(), just like the previous case of this
problem (that Zoltan pointed out).  A quick grep for do_single
indicates that all calls to do_single() that should be followed by an
invalidatelist() now are.  The older problem is due to listambig being
set, and remaining set, when REC_EXACT is invoked, letting AUTO_MENU
start menu completion on the next tab when it shouldn't.  This is fixed
by moving the line that sets listambig.
