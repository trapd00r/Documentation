} This doesn't work with eval "echo /bi<^xf>

It works, but it's treating everything starting at the double-quote as
a single argument, so it's looking for a directory named "echo " with
a file inside whose name starts with "bi".

If what you're asking for is a way to force all the context-sensitive
command-line parsing but replace the context-sensitive completions with
file completion, then no, there's no simple way to do that.

(Ignoring for the nonce that _precommand doesn't unquote the first arg
for "eval" in any case, so context-sensitive completion doesn't do the
right thing either.)
