 We have a problem converting some ksh-Scripts to zsh.
 In one of our Scripts we use the IFS-Variable of ksh.
 We encountered problems with the zsh, not recognizing the IFS-
 Variable. Is there a different Syntax in zsh? Is the ksh IFS-Variable
 assigned to a different name in zsh?


 We´would like to hear from you,
