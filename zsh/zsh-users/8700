I would suggest something like

a=3D(fotos*) mutt eric '-a '${^a} -s "all images attached" </dev/null
or
mutt eric '-a '${^$(print *)} -s "all images attached" </dev/null

This creates a temporary array containing all file names in the
globbing pattern and expands it with the RC_EXPAND_PARAM option set.
