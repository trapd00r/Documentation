How often are you running single user?  If the system is so badly hosed that
you can't get it to go multi-user, having zsh doesn't help much.

ed? I use cat. :-)

But seriously, you didn't read what I said.  I keep "root" simple for
emergencies.  That is, to make sure I can login in an emergency.  I have a
pretty fancy set of zsh startup scripts and I don't want a stupid mistake or
an oversite to shut me out of root.  An alternate root account with a
different login name and zsh gives me the best of both worlds: safety and
functionality.

I manage a lot of machines remotely too and I also like having a good shell.
But, I don't mind an extra root account.

However, my main point was: you can have it exactly the way you want it with
a three line script.  Trying to make configure be all things to all people
seems unwise.
