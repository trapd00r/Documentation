But this only runs if configure or config.status is run, and this
doesn't happen every make.  Sometimes a new module also alters one of
the configure files; then the top-level Makefile will pick up that
things have changed and run this code.  There is no direct dependency
*simply* on piling in some extra .mdd files.  I would guess socket
didn't need to change the configure stuff, but db did.
