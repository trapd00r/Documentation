But at least it doesn't do the same thing twice over again once more...

About the only alternative is to hold the values in a fixed array or
(preferably) associative array and allow functions to grope around in it.
That would eliminate the explicit expl which crops up everywhere.
However, it would need setting and unsetting for each function where
expl is currently local.  I suspect it needs lower level help to do it
neatly.
