I just want to go on record as stating that I think this is really NOT a good 
thing.  IMO, *way* too many scripts and functions are going to break.  Bart's 
example is a good one:

: grind Mon 15 11:04; echo $ZSH_VERSION
3.0-pre2
: grind Mon 15 11:04; [[-z $foo]] && echo foo is not set
foo is not set
  
: grind Mon 15 11:05; echo $ZSH_VERSION
3.0-pre3
: grind Mon 15 11:05; [[-z $foo]] && echo foo is not set
zsh: bad pattern: [[-z

Big picture questions: How can we have major changes like this shortly before 
a release?  What's the timeframe for the 3.0 release?  When do we stop making 
incompatible changes?
