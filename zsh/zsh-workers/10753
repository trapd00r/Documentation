Yes, I've been thinking about adding something like this to the
manual, too -- and then forgot, as usual. I would have used the match
spec used by the functions that complete X colour names as an example, 
which allows to use the uppercase letters (and digits) as shortcuts.

The same is possible with digits. The point is that, different from
what the examples we give seem to imply, the anchor need not be
anything special:

  % ls
  foo1 foo2 foo3
  % zstyle ':completion:*:*:foo:*' matcher 'r:|[0-9]=* r:|=*'
  % foo f2<TAB>
 ->
  % foo foo2

See? The colour thing:

  % xterm -fg IR<TAB>
 ->
  % xterm IndianRed
  IndianRed   IndianRed1  IndianRed2  IndianRed3  IndianRed4

or

  % xterm -fg IR4<TAB>
 ->
  % xterm -fg IndianRed4

Isn't live just fun? Sometimes.

Wow, someone offers to improve the manual... I'd be very thankful.
