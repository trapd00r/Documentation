Very nice, Bart.  I didn't know about zle-line-init.

You could gzip and base64 encode some representation of it..

Cool!

What would you think of adding another "special" widget like
zle-line-init but run when the line editor is finished, call
it something like zle-line-finished or zle-line-done?

Is that as simple as copying the zle-line-init code just below
the call to zlecore() and changing the function name in zleread()
in zle_main.c?  Maybe I'll play with that..

thanks,
Greg
