You could pass the file "mail" as an argument to url-extract, then only
redirect from it internally for the chunk which needs it.  That avoids
any dependence on /dev/tty.  Remember you can do things like:

  {
    # stuff with mail as input
  } <mail

  # stuff with normal input

without having to create subshells.
