Fair enough.  If there's a good way of separating out the SVr4 bits from
the Solaris-specific bits, I'm happy to do that, but I definitely don't
want to dump it all into something labeled SVr4 just for someone to find
they can't actually use it.

Any ideas on what we should do about that?  It could be in a more general
directory, and have a test to see if it's Solaris, adding the Solaris-
specific bits if so ... would that work for you?

Okay; I'm definitely curious to see how general some of the Solaris
commands are w.r.t. other SVr4 systems are.

You're quite welcome.  Thanks for the review.
