OK, you're right. But then, "cd so" should complete to "cd soft" (and
not "cd software"), then give the choice between "soft" (because it
is a named directory) and "software" (directory in the cwd). In fact,
just like if CD_ABLE_VARS added a special virtual directory to the
cdpath, containing the named directories.

BTW, can I define an alias "c." in such a way that it behaves as if
cdpath were (.), or as "cd ./"?
