With useradd/usermod, it's very useful to have /bin/false as a match. If
the user account won't need to login then that's a common way to ensure
it can't.

I don't use screen but does that option only get used with actual
shells?

That branch is still adding /bin/false. If screen's -s option is
commonly used, you may want to expand this a bit.
