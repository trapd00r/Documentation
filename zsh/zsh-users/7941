I'm sorry, I missed the second (result="foo") assignment when I was trying 
the examples, so I thought you always had a multi-word scalar to start 
with.  Ignore my previous message.

A scalar is a scalar, and the result of splitting a scalar is only an 
array if the split actually does something.

Further, using $=array forces the array to be a scalar and then applies
the preceding rule.

So your only safe bet is to actually assign the scalar to an array, and
then use subscripting on the array.
