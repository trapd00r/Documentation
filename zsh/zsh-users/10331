  I did:
  solfire:/home/mccramer>ls -l /bin/zsh
  -rwxr-xr-x 2 root root 754456 Mar 28 18:32 /bin/zsh
  solfire:/home/mccramer>

  and it is no problem for me to execute /bin/zsh from the commandline
  -- just getting another shell.

  With vim I loaded the script in question and did a 
  "set list", which displays anything, which normally is suppressed.
  After the "h" of "#!/bin/zsh" there is only a "$", meaning that
  this is the end of line.

  Same results with another editor (Microemacs).

  Are there any other "bad invisible things", which may cause this
  effect ?

  Kepp hacking!
