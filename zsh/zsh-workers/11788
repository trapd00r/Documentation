} If you look back it my previous message (11755), you'll see that I had
} stuck a section of types.h in at the end.

Oops, I thought that was part of the diff and never even looked at it.

} after a preprocessor check for _MIPS_SZLONG == 32.

Where does _MIPS_SZLONG come from?

The test for ino_t passes this:

#include "confdefs.h"
#include <sys/types.h>
#if STDC_HEADERS
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stddef.h>
#endif

through the preprocessor and then egreps to find ino_t.  From the snippet
you sent, the egrep should fail only if _MIPS_SZLONG is neither 32 nor 64.
Unless IRIX's egrep is broken, which is not impossible ...
