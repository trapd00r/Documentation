    I have exactly the same problem. It has to do, if I recall
correctly, with PTY handling. I cannot give more details because I
had the problem a long time ago and I simply forgot it :((

    A quick'n'dirty search in zsh-workers gives zsh-workers-19343 as
the message that started the thread last time I had the problem. I
Never solved it, unfortunately :((
