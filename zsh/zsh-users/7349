Heh.  You *can* do ${array[EXP][Whatever]},
or you can do ${${array[EXP]}[Whatever]},
but you can't do what you said you tried.

schaefer[228] array=( "this text [that text] those texts"
array> "more text [less text] some text"
array> "any text [other text] neither text" )
schaefer[229] print ${array[2][(r)\[,(R)\]]}
[less text]

Also there was a bug until recently where if EXP is a negative number,
then the result of $array[EXP] is still an array rather than a string,
so then the [Whatever] fails to slice the string.
