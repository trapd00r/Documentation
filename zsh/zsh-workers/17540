    Hi Bart :)

    Well, when my login zsh starts, the only modules that are loaded
are zsh/zle and zsh/main. zsh/compctl is not there. Maybe I'm not
invoking any builtin in my rc's so compctl is autoloaded :??

>messed-up module_path, but

    Yes, they are statically linked. I'm having an idea... What if I
configured compctl prior to compilation as being statically linked
but NOT autoloaded (I mean, with load=no in the .mdd file)? I don't
have the mdd that I used for compilation, I'm afraid :((( But this
can be the problem, true?

    Yes, you are right, because if something is wrong, then other
fails will arise sooner or later... Just that I have bigger problems
than that ;))) Fortunately zsh works fine always ;))

    Thanks for your help again, Bart.
