} If you put the following into a loop it won't work. Is there a
} workaround?

What exactly do you expect to happen when you run "ed" in the background?
As far as I can tell it simply exits immediately, which would explain why
you only have one of them running at a time.

} zsh -x shows that it's not even taking the &.

You are misled.  "zsh -x" does not print the "&" because it doesn't print
*any* command separators.  Compare with:

#! /bin/zsh -f
while :;do
sleep 5 & sleep 6 &
jobs
sleep 1
done
