Hi workers,

The zkbd function currently fails to start. In particular, it seems to
be the following test (I don't actually understand how that test works
at all :-):

[snip]
[[ -o interactive ]] && {
    local -i ARGC
    (ARGC=0) 2>/dev/null || {
        print -u2 ${0}: must be run as a function or shell script, not sourced
        return 1
    }
}
[snap]

Since this worked before, I git-bisected my way through the younger
zsh code history and I was able to find the commit that breaks it for
me.

The last working commit that works is this:

  2007-05-28 13:08 pws
      23478: crash in reverse-menu-complete if no completion

And the next commit (the one that breaks it) is:

  2007-05-28 22:57 pws
      see 23479: add initial features support for modules

Since these are commits in a cvs->git conversion of the zsh tree, here
is some extra information to locate the change I'm referring to (in
case the conversion is not accurate enough):

The commit adds this Changelog entry:

Unfortunately, the commit is rather big, so I won't be able to find
the problematic part on my own. I did create a diff between the two
commits in question and uploaded it to:

  <http://ft.bewatermyfriend.org/tmp/zsh_breaks.diff>

I hope that helps.

Regards, Frank
