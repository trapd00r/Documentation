This may have already been fixed but the diff completion seemed to call
diff with /dev/null as stdin but not stdout and stderr. This causes me
to get an error messages about -v not being an option in the middle of
my command line. I take it that redirecting stdin was a typo?

I seem to remember a recent discussion which I didn't follow fully about
how to call programs from completion functions and a proposed
configurable function for doing it so I haven't patched the use of
'command diff'. I leave the original diff and link GNU diff to 'gdiff'.
With the current _diff, I can't then get GNU style completion for gdiff.
Having both the GNU and supplied utilites are fairly common place on
commercial UNIX installations. For this reason, I object to using
non-local variables like _diff_is_gnu and calling 'diff' instead of
pulling out the first word on the command-line.
