Greetings!!!

First of all, I have searched the documentation and I haven't found
the answer so I write to you.

Is there any way in zsh to make a function declared with "function
name() {..." syntax a global one? That is exported to environment
of child processes of zsh which means also other instances of zsh.
I would like to define a function in /etc/zlogin or zprofile (a *login*
scrpit) and not in zshrc and make it defined for all subprocesses.

Have nice day...
