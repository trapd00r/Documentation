No, this is not really a bug.  It also has nothing to do with the themed
prompt system; the prompt is always reprinted whenever the window is
resized.  However, you can't *see* this happening unless the prompt has
a newline character in it (which most of the themed prompts happen to).

The prompt is reprinted because it might contain conditionals that depend
on the width of the terminal, or because there might be an RPS1 (right-
side prompt) that has to be repositioned.
