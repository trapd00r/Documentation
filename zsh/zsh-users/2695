Hello,

I was wondering yesterday if there is a simple way to rename all my song
files(mp3) from


name with spaces.mp3   ->  Name With Spaces.mp3

with something like:
for i in *.mp3; do 
mv -v $i (UNKNOWN_PART_TO_ME)
done


I tried using sed there but with no luck. Can anyone give me a clue here?
