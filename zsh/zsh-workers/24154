No, the shell is quite cautious what it executes in signal handlers;
system errors are pretty much inevitable, but there's no module handling
there so no call to dlerror.

strerror_r() is the way of ensuring thread safety in printing the
message by providing a buffer into which data is written.  The GNU
library manual entry does actually claim it's thread-safe; that
means that any hidden back-end functions it uses are thread-safe too.

To put it another way, I don't really care how it solves the problem; if
it doesn't it's broken.

There is a possible problem that strerror_r() might need more memory
than we pass it if it's doing random additional things, I suppose, but
the manual doesn't give any guidance.

No, I was testing I hadn't broken anything.

There isn't; I was referring to an existing test that failed while I was
writing the patch: diff assumed the difference in output was binary and
didn't show it.

If strerror_r() really doesn't do what it's supposed to then it needs
fixing.
