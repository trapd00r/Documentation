} Ok, here is the patch how I'll commit it in a few moments.

Hrm.  I got a conflict when merging this into my local CVS repository
at home.  For some reason I have

zstyle -t ":completion:${curcontext}:" completions && compstate[insert]=all

at line 27 of _match.  I'm going to presume it just shouldn't be there,
but I thought I'd mention it.
