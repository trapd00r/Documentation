Yes, except we already screwed that up long ago; the configure file is
full of tests of that kind and adding one more isn't going to make a
difference.  (I'm doubtful whether it could be got to work without a
whole pile of extra run-time tests, and extremely doubtful that it's
worth the effort trying.)  Andrej's solution will be good enough when it
works.
