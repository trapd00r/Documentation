On this crappy system (AIX 4.1.X), it must be the multiple level of
indirection problem that Bart mentioned.  I also duplicated this behavior
on HP-UX 10.20.  Using the actual binary:

#!/afs/pdx/proj/otools/bin/AIX/zsh -f

instead of the wrapper seems to make it work.  Bummer...  Compiling a
wrapper program again defeats the purpose of having an
architecture-independent launch point.
