I got this bug report...

Although I don't get quite the same behaviour (probably due to options),
I can see the / being removed and put back and no completion in the
directory being added.  This boils down to a bug with the following code:

  _tst1() {
      local dir=${PREFIX%%[^/]#}
      # The details of this don't matter much, only
      # the fact that it adds a completion with ... after the
      # directory.
      compadd -J subdirs -p $dir -W $dir ...
  }
  _tst() { _alternative "files:file:_path_files" "dots:dots:_tst1"; }
  compdef _tst tst

Now completing after "tst" exhibits the same symptoms.  I hadn't noticed
because it's suppressed by some option I'm using, I think to do with
tag grouping (but simply putting the subdirs in another group doesn't
work, since that's what I've done in _tst1).

Before I simply try to work round this, does anyone have the first
clue what might be going on in the completion system to cause this?
