I doubt anyone here keeps up with opensolaris much, but there's a proposal
to integrate some DTrace probes into Solaris' Bourne shell, with the
explicit idea that other shells could have this functionality integrated
later on.  If anyone is curious, or wants to comment, the thread archive is
here.

    http://mail.opensolaris.org/pipermail/opensolaris-arc/2008-January/005562.html

Discussion should time out next Wednesday, though there's a chance it could
be short-circuited tomorrow.
