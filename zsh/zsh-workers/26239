It nevertheless stops whatever is going on and makes you hit enter, which
is not that much better than answering "N" to a request to correct the
command name.

Well, on Ubuntu under bash when a command is not found you get told what
to do to install it (e.g. what package to apt-get install).  This could
be the basis for something like that for zsh.
