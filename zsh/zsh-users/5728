  If we're being blunt, what it boils down to is doing whatever it is
that keeps the admins happy.  If people are going around creating and
supporting an outstanding piece of software for me, for free, I
certainly am all in favor of having their tools work the way _they_ want
them to.  Compared to that, you, me, and Joe Schmoe can all bug off.  :)=20
