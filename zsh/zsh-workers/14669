Many thanks to everybody who contributed to this, who know who they are.

I still have to post announcments to comp.unix.shell (have to do that from
home) and freshmeat (trying to get ownership of the project registered
there, which is currently owned by `N/A' --- I'm guessing taking it over
won't be too hard).  Other than that, I think it's in the bag.

There's a tradition that something major breaks at the last minute and we
have to do another release immediately after.  If that doesn't happen by
the middle of next week --- by which time any problems are hearby declared
to be non-disastrous --- any patches being held off can go in.

At some point we will probably need to create a 4.1 branch.  I hadn't
intended doing this until there was some major change in the pipeline.
If anyone has some significant changes planned, we can create it any time.
But managing two branches is a pain in the neck if they're both just
getting small tweaks.
