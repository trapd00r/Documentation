1. matcher control does not suggest ** matcher. I still find it the hell
useful (even as last resort).

2. Should compinstall provide default values for different prompts?
Espicially, for scrolling lists? It is hard to invent them on the fly.

3. Setting styles after finishing compinstall does not purge current
styles. I am not sure, if there is any way to do it.
