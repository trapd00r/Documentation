Ah.  You're right.

That looks good enough.  You can optimise out the subprocess by changing
this to

   if [[ $1 == .* || $(builtin whence $1) == .* ]]; then

the point being that in your case, where . isn't part of the path, you
are actually relying on the . being part of $1, so you never need the
code in the $(...).

You could probably change the patterns to (.|..)/* (as we're in
zsh-specific land) for a little extra safety but it doesn't make much
difference unless you have files starting with ".".
