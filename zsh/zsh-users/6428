Exactly.  I got bit by this a few years ago when I had a .zshenv file
and was using gdb -- it runs a $SHELL to start the debugged program,
and this overrode some environment values that I did NOT want touched
(ouch).  I now use no .zshenv file at all, and I cannot think of any
good reason for me (or for most typical users) to need one.

I now use .zprofile and .zshrc, and I even have a special line in my
.zshrc file that sources .zprofile if it discovers that .zprofile has
not been sourced yet (which had happened to me in some circumstances
before, but is not a problem in my current situation where I first
login, and then run X Windows).
