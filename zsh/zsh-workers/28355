Actually the problem is when the previous line ends in a wide char in
the new line, doesn't matter where the cursor is.

Hmm, it seems the problem is somewhere in refreshline (surprise,
right?). First all the characters of "echo =E3=81=AE" are printed one by on=
e,
but then ol is advanced past the end of the old string "uuuuuu" and
somehow after that are =E3=81=AE=E3=81=AE=E3=81=AE which causes

/* skip past all matching characters */
for (; nl->chr && ZR_equal(*ol, *nl); nl++, ol++, ccs++)
    ;

to trigger, which is why the rest of the string isn't output. Why this
happens is a bit of a mystery to me still.
