Great!  I think the only thing that's missing is a description of the command 
line editing keys.  That's something that would be suitable for a reference 
card, I'd have thought.

Also, if you just print it out, the text looks very big.  It would be 
comfortable printed 2-up, IMHO.  That may be personal taste, however.

So when can I buy the O'Reilly zsh book complete with reference card?

Heck, throw in some descriptions of the wackier functions (compctl springs to 
mind), and I'd buy a desktop reference, like the Perl5 one.  Needs a bit more 
to justify that, but not much more.
