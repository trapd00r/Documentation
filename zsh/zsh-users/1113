i sometimes love to view only a few new mails in a newsgroup.
then i take my lynx and let it view the newsserver with a special
newsgroup.

only the newsgroup should be a variable. because i read many newsgroups.

lynx news:<variable>

<variable> should be completed.

say, i wanted to search for unix in newsgroup-names with the script below:.

cat ~/..nn/ACTIVE | cut -d  ' ' -f1 | grep $1

now i want zsh to complete all found unix-newsgroups for me to choose from.
and then invoke lynx news:<all-unix-newsgroups to choose from>

anyone here, who has a solution?
i simply do not get it.
i think, -P "news:" should be there with compctl, the rest i am not sure.
I only think , i need a function which should be completed somehow.


please help me!
