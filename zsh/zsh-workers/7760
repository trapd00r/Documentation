} I have constant problems with

If there were a way to fix it with pure patch, I don't think Tanaka would
have written a patch for patch.

If you use "cvs patch" (aka "cvs rdiff") instead of "cvs diff", the output
is much more patch-friendly; but you need two tagged revisions for that to
be very useful.  I have no idea why the CVS developers didn't make diff do
the same output format as rdiff.
