I was thinking of this myself, and someone else mentioned it as well, so I  
went ahead and made the change.

The problem with the previous setup is the the file was in HTML.  It was  
hard to download and even if you did you'd have to convert it back to ASCII.

So I changed it.

1) zsh@peak.org is now subscribed to zsh-workers
	a) you don't have to CC zsh@peak.org.

	b) any post you send to the list which begins with "PATCH:"
		will be archived
		
2) patches will be stored at: http://www.peak.org/zsh/patches
	(note the lowercase of the URL)

3) patches are in ASCII

4) patches are named:
	PostNumber-Subject.txt
	
	The Subject has the spaces removed.  As long as people don't use
	really funky characters (ie !#&^(*@!&$^_ etc) in the Subject:
	we ought to be ok.


I think that's it.
