Hi,

in a german newsgroup there was a discussion about undeleting files and
someone came up with zsh's option 'rmstarwait'. However I tried to
'setopt rmstarwait' and to delete a (previously copied) directory ('rm
test/*'). It was deleted without any waiting or comments. Further
testing gave me same results. What could be the problem here (zsh
4.2.5)?
