That's fair enough, but I don't think a change in the redirection
syntax qualifies as something likely to produce a portability problem.
The underlying features used are the same; the addition is an internal
shell parameter assignment (which had also better work).  Unless you
think using file descriptors over 10 is likely to be problematic?  But
the shell has used those internally for a long time.
