Peter,

Using the latest sources from CVS, I cannot link.  Here are the errors:

Modules/parameter.o(.text+0x31b5): In function `setpmdisgalias':
: undefined reference to `setgalias'
Modules/parameter.o(.text+0x31e5): In function `setpmsalias':
: undefined reference to `setgalias'
Modules/parameter.o(.text+0x3215): In function `setpmdissalias':
: undefined reference to `setgalias'
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status

Did you not check in part of your latest patch?

  - Vin
