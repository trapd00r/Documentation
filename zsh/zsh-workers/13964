} No, that's bad.  Don't commit it.  <term.h> is not included by system.h

It appears everything in the #ifndef HAVE_TERMCAP_H block in prototypes.h
is declared in <term.h>.  So rather than #ifdef just that one line in
prototypes.h, it's probably better to (1) change system.h to conditionally
include <term.h> (only when not HAVE_TERMCAP_H) and (2) make the entire
block in prototypes.h be wrapped in

#if !(defined(HAVE_TERMCAP_H) || defined(HAVE_TERM_H))
