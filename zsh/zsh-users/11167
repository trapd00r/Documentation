Thanks for the reminder, now I think I have cooked up an ideal
solution, at least for me. I summary:

~/.zshenv does only setopt no_global_rcs
~/.zprofile sources /etc/profile using sh emulation, then adjusts
paths, sets environment variables, i.e., things that get inherited
~/.zshrc defines aliases/funtions/completion control
~/.zlogin handles ssh keys using keychain(1)

In my "use cases" this works perfectly. (I always do one of the
following: on local computer, console login / on local computer, using
X/xterm / logging to a remote computer via ssh.)

Thanks!
