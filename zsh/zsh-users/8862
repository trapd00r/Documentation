No, it must simply be that you have globassign set interactively, e.g.
in .zshrc or /etc/zshrc.  It always assigns an array; you'll find
in the interactive case $files[1] is /bin/cat.  It's "for backwards
compatibility only" exactly because of this confusion: the syntax says
"scalar", but the glob says "array".

files=(/bin/c*)

is the right way to do this.
