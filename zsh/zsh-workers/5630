I may get a chance to reply to more of this later, but for now:

As long as we're revisiting this discussion and adding things like the
new NUMERIC parameter, allow me to direct your attention to these old
zsh-workers postings and any associated threads:

http://www.zsh.org/cgi-bin/mla/redirect?WORKERNUMBER=3D4067
http://www.zsh.org/cgi-bin/mla/redirect?WORKERNUMBER=3D4073 (Bug report=

I'm strongly in favor of having zle widget functions return a useful
value (see 4067) and Zefram even agreed with me, but I don't think
anything ever came of it.
