Wize guy, eh?

If you want a decision, then we'd better stick with `-ize' (apart from
-wise, of course).  Many of the changes were necesssary because I spelled
it the other way (I can't rememember how Sven does).  The authorities agree
that -ize has a perfectly good pedigree on both sides of the Atlantic,
although other oceans may be a different matter.

On the other hand, I'm not sure I can bring myself to face `honor' and
`color'.  Luckily, they don't occour, err, occur; we'd better keep it that
way to avoid an incident.
