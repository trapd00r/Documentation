Debatable.  Arguably the setting of a prompt shouldn't trigger
potentially large amounts of work (reading in the list of users from
LDAP, for instance, with >10k users).

There are arguments either way.

The shortest match wins.

/var/www is the same length as www-data and shorter than ~www-data; zsh
will take the shortest match.  If ~name is the same length or shorter
than /path then ~name will be used.

It's actually a complete scan through the entire list of all known
names, searching for the one with the "best" difference in length.
