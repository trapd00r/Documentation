Note also that this (prefix-needed=yes) is the default value for the
style, so it will hurt only people who explictily turn it off.

I second that.

I think Clint's patch was in response to the article/mail on one of
the Debian lists which I found and which made me add file-completion
to _x_arguments. Hm, we could make it call _default instead...

The patch is relative to the CVS so it also turns the #autoload back
into a #compdef (with a slightly different pattern then before; are
there still systems with X11R[45]?).
