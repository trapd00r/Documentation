} Are you aware of any applications which _do not_ split EDITOR on spaces
} or is this all theoretical?

I suspect that most applications do the equivalent of

	eval "$EDITOR $1"

which accomplishes the splitting of $EDITOR at some security risk if the
environment is tainted.

Then the spaces-in-the-path problem is solvable by embedding quotes or
backslashes in the value of $EDITOR.

Zsh could meet the two extremes halfway by using ${(Q)${(z)EDITOR}}.
