I think it was I (all right, me) that changed it, so that if you type
\<RETURN> then typing a ^D acted as list-choices instead of eof.  This
seemed logical since lexically you are in the middle of a line.

Actually, if we have a mission statement ("...proactively integrate
synergetic industry metaphors into a dynamic system-invariant
state-of-the-art user interface..." ???), I vote for inclusion of the
phrase "flexibility in user-space configuration is absolutely no
substitute for a satisfactory default" (suitably disguised, of course).

generator.
