The problem appears to be that the UTF-8 string coming from %D{%a} is
not being metafied, so zputs() is outputting the string wrong.  The
above PS1 setting on a Thursday results in this 4-char string being
assigned to lpromptbuf:

    \304\254et

The second character does not pass the itok() test, so it is skipped,
mangling the output.

If I assign the above 4-character string directly to PS1 via a variable,
the second character is properly metafied:

    \304\203\254et

And the string outputs correctly.
