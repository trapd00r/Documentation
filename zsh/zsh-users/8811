Hello.

I'm on a Pentium 120 with FreeBSD 5.4-STABLE, and zsh-4.2.5.
When I log in, I have to wait in between 5 to 10 seconds before
the prompt displays. Even though I use a functional zshrc file
that has proven to work on other systems, things like auto
completion doesn't seem to work in this case.

# cat /etc/zshrc
#
http://www.home.no/hedhnta/zshrc

# cat /etc/zlogout
#
http://www.home.no/hedhnta/zlogout

# zsh -x
#
http://www.home.no/hedhnta/zsh-x

Somebody know?
Thanks.
