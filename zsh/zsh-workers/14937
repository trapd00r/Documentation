This is because it doesn't load the tcp module, which is new and still
being debugged, and we haven't thought of a way of telling the shell about
dependencies for modules that aren't loaded automatically.

I'd highly recommend using zftp via the shell function front end; autoload
and run zfinit and preferably read the zshzftpsys manual page.  If you have
the latest version of that, loading of the tcp module is handled.
