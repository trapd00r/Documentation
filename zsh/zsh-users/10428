Hi Bart,

No, thanks for the hint!
Hm, the description of the function sounds great but I don't understand how
it's supposed to work.  I've got TAB bound to complete-word and now use:
 zstyle ':completion:*' completer _expand _expand_dots _complete _match _correct _7slash
but the behavior is still the same: when I press TAB I get to see all the
possible completions but they don't get written to the command line.
Do I need any other style definitions?

Correct.  nocaseglob would help in this example of mine but there are many
different cases where the completer shows all kinds of different types of
possible completions, e.g. the "partial match" style:
 zstyle ':completion:*' matcher-list 'm:{A-Zöäüa-zÖÄÜ}={a-zÖÄÜA-Zöäü} m:[-_]=[-_] r:|[-./_]=** r:|=*' '+l:|=*'
which gives:

I tried calling the _expand function manually (via Alt-x) but that just
hogged the CPU so that I had to kill zsh. :-(

Thanks,
 Andy.
