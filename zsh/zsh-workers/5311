I know as little about yodl as most everyone else, but this patch fixes 
the first problem I had when trying to compile the yodl zsh docs under 
cygwin.  Maybe it was because I'm running a recent development snapshot 
of yodl, but whatever the reason I was finding that using CHAR(+) was 
barfing, so I changed it to CHAR(43).
