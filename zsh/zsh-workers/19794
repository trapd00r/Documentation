declare not accepting -m goes back to before the mailing list archives
so unless you have older archives, it won't be easy to find out. My
suspicion is that it was an oversight when -m was added but it may have
been bash compatibility.

The oldest list of declare options I see in the mailing list is
"LRUZfilrtux" (workers/1966). -U is the one non-ksh[1] option in there
(bash has fewer but ksh options may have been considered safe). We've
added a good few more since. -F is even incompatible with bash and that's
ksh93 too.  So I really don't see much harm in adding -m to declare's
options. Or do you disagree?

[1] ksh88 or 93. -U is unsigned integer in pdksh
