Does anyone have any experience running zsh inside GNU Screen? On all 
the boxes I've used them on until now, zsh always started inside screen 
as a non-login shell--i.e., zshrc was executed, but not zprofile. 
However, just today I set up my usual environment on a box running 
GenToo linux, GNU Screen 4.00.01, and zsh 4.2.0, and it appears to have 
changed--zprofile seems to be executing too. This poses something of a 
problem, as my means of executing screen is through zprofile, so if 
when screen creates a new window, zsh calls zprofile again, I end up 
with nested screens, and a possible infinite recursion problem. Does 
anyone know why this is happening (or what I can do to prevent it)?

BTW, one example of a box that gives the correct behavior is Mac OS X 
10.3.4, zsh 4.1.1, screen 3.09.15.
