My guess would be a lot fewer than bash or tcsh.  Both bash or tcsh
are far more likely to be people's default shells.

In my company of 120 people or so, I'm the only one who uses zsh.  And
that was pretty much by accident.  I couldn't figure out how to get
bash to do what zsh does when you:

setopt AutoList
setopt AutoMenu
setopt ListTypes
setopt ListAmbiguous

so I went looking for another shell.
