Hi all,
	Am I missing something?  It appears that the Darwin completion 
functions aren't installed by default.  Here's what I mean:

% tar xjf zsh-4.2.2.tar.bz2
% cd zsh-4.2.2
% ./configure --prefix=$HOME/zshtest --enable-function-subdirs
% make && make check && make install

Here's the relevant output:

mkdir /Users/install/zshtest/share
mkdir /Users/install/zshtest/share/zsh
mkdir /Users/install/zshtest/share/zsh/site-functions
mkdir /Users/install/zshtest/share/zsh/4.2.2
mkdir /Users/install/zshtest/share/zsh/4.2.2/functions
mkdir /Users/install/zshtest/share/zsh/4.2.2/functions/Misc
mkdir /Users/install/zshtest/share/zsh/4.2.2/functions/MIME
mkdir /Users/install/zshtest/share/zsh/4.2.2/functions/Prompts
mkdir /Users/install/zshtest/share/zsh/4.2.2/functions/TCP
mkdir /Users/install/zshtest/share/zsh/4.2.2/functions/Zftp
mkdir /Users/install/zshtest/share/zsh/4.2.2/functions/Completion
mkdir /Users/install/zshtest/share/zsh/4.2.2/functions/Completion/AIX
mkdir /Users/install/zshtest/share/zsh/4.2.2/functions/Completion/BSD
mkdir /Users/install/zshtest/share/zsh/4.2.2/functions/Completion/Base
mkdir /Users/install/zshtest/share/zsh/4.2.2/functions/Completion/Cygwin
mkdir /Users/install/zshtest/share/zsh/4.2.2/functions/Completion/Debian
mkdir /Users/install/zshtest/share/zsh/4.2.2/functions/Completion/Linux
mkdir 
/Users/install/zshtest/share/zsh/4.2.2/functions/Completion/Mandrake
mkdir /Users/install/zshtest/share/zsh/4.2.2/functions/Completion/Redhat
mkdir /Users/install/zshtest/share/zsh/4.2.2/functions/Completion/Unix
mkdir /Users/install/zshtest/share/zsh/4.2.2/functions/Completion/X
mkdir /Users/install/zshtest/share/zsh/4.2.2/functions/Completion/Zsh
mkdir /Users/install/zshtest/share/zsh/4.2.2/functions/Zle

Note there was no 'mkdir 
/Users/install/zshtest/share/zsh/4.2.2/functions/Completion/Darwin' 
line.  If I edit zsh-4.2.2/config.modules after running './configure' 
so that the line starting with 'name=zsh/complete' contains 
'Completion/Darwin/*/*' I get the Darwin completions installed.  Was 
this an oversight or done on purpose?

Thanks,
Ryan
