It's to do with the code that joins parameters with what's next to them,
which is why the RC_EXPAND_PARAM option is different.  Quite why it does
what it does I don't understand either, however; but I don't really
understand this particular piece of traditional behaviour at all.
If I were changing it, rather than try to sanitize it I would simply
remove it.
