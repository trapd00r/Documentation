} It could be either.  What causes the autoconf 2.10 version of the
} lstat test to fail?  (Find out by looking in config.log after running
} configure.)

I included that in the original message.

/tmp/cca194791.o(.text+0x14): undefined reference to `lstat'

That's all, nothing else.  I just figured out why it fails, though:  lstat
is an *inline function only* that expands to a call to _lxstat.  If you
don't include <sys/stat.h> (which the conftest does not), you can't detect
lstat.

Perhaps AC_CHECK_FUNCS is the wrong way to test for lstat?  I don't have
autoconf 2.10 installed to check the info for a more specific AC_* test.
