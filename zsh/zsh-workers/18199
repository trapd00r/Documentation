    Hi Stephane :)

    Neither have I O:)) And the number of specs seems to grow on a
daily basis...

    Oh, sorry, didn't know that the development branch of zsh
implements a printf builtin O:)

    I think that is better to stuck to an standard, being that POSIX
or SuS. Since SuS gives its spec freely (I mean, you don't have to
pay for giving free software to the community that is SuS compliant)
I prefer that standard over the rest, but obviously is a personal
choice ;)))

    Being bash-compliant is, IMHO, just a way of standardize bad
behaviour. If GNU printf is broken, non POSIX or SuS compliant, then
submit a bug report. The shellutils developers care about standard
compliance, I've submitted such bug reports in the past.

    Bye :)
