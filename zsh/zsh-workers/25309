Subject: Is there any interest in indentation patches?

I have been going through a few functions and there is no clear style
when it comes to indentation. Some files use whitespaces, some use tabs,
many use a combination of the two. Some use 2 chars, some use 4. No idea
if the commit noise is wanted, but I could prepare a batch of patches to
fix this. It's work no one wants to do, anyway :p

Is that wasted effort or a worthwhile thing to do?
