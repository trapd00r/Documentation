Maybe select-prompt is more consistent than select-status, which implies a
returned value, although it should be the same as the parameter.

It occurs to me that you can display other stuff in this prompt, e.g. info
about the currently selected file in menu-select mode.  But that's nothing
to do with scrolling.

Yes, I think that would be OK.
