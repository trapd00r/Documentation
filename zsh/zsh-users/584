I've noticed the slash sometimes gets doubled, which I've never
tracked down, but I think it's internal to zle_tricky.c (some
confusion with suffixes?), since if you type one slash and list the
completions with ^D, they appear correct.  I haven't seen it fail to
complete subfolders, however.  I presume there is more than one
subfolder, so it can't start a completion.  It should still be able to
autolist, though.
