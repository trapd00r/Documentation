Because Paul didn't want to use the GPL license.  The original license
didn't allow commercial usage.  When I became maintainer, I convinced
Paul to let me switch zsh to a BSD style copyright (and at the time, he
specifically didn't want to use GPL).  The current copyright is from an
older Tcl/Tk distribution.

Also, part of the zsh distribution is copyright by me, but I have agreed
to use whatever copyright that Paul wants to use on the rest of the
zsh distribution.

Personally, I think Richard Stallman is just being overly paranoid
about this.  I think the current copyright is fine.
