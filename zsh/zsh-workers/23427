For that, I've very idea.  I have so far steered clear of touching zle
and input processing on the "learn to walk before you try to run"
principle.

What I have noticed is that the configure tests for multibyte changed
between 4.3.2 and 4.3.4.  It might be helpful for those who _can_ debug
these if you can dig out config.log and config.h from both the 4.3.2 and
4.3.4 builds and put them on a webserver, posting the URLs here.  At a
_very_ brief look, it seems that there was a move to checking for
existence of the standardised API for widechar handling.
