The bugs listed in the Etc/Bugs file (assuming version 2.5), fixed or is
this file outdated.

I've encountered the present problems so far in zsh-2.6-beta12

running Linux 1.3.20, compiled into it are the shared libaries

libtermcap.so.2.0.0
libc.so.5.0.9

my compctl for cd which worked in version 2.5.03 now causes a segmentation
fault.  i'll try to get a trace on it, but it's damn near strange.

cd -g '*(-/) - +' -x 'c[-1,~/]' -g '(-/)' - 'c[-1,~]' -u

if i type cd /ts<tab> i get a beep as consistant with option nolistbeep.
if i type cd /tsp<tab> i get the seg. fault.

i'll email the trace, but i'm wondering if anyone else can duplicate.

also with the new termcap code introduced recently, my watchfmt no longer
acknowledges escapes codes (%[BbSsUu]).  i'm working on tracking down where
in the code this inconsistancy is happening.
