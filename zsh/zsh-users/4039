It works fine for me, using FreeBSD 4.3-STABLE and zsh 4.0.2 from
ports.
I think it works fine for you too, you just don't see it :-)

What happens is that perl prints 'aaa' as it should and then zsh
regains control and prints the prompt.
This prompt overwrites the 'aaa'.

Bash apparently does not return the cursor to the leftmost column
before printing the prompt while zsh does.

Solution: Make sure that your output ends with a newline.
Eg.
perl -e "print 'aaa'" ; echo

This should give the expected result.

(You might try to replace the 'echo' on the line above with 'sleep 5'
to observe what happens. This will let the 'aaa' be displayed for 5
seconds before it is overwritten by zsh's prompt.)
