That's probably the same bug for which Peter sent a fix earlier, which is
included below.  Please try this, and tell me if it fixes your problem or
not.  There will be a zsh-3.0.5 release, and that's one of the reasons
that zsh-3.0.4 was not announced on zsh-announce.

That one I cannot reproduce.  Does this happen with zsh-3.0.4?  Does this
happen when you use ttyctl -f before calling tclsh?  If it doesn't, what
stty shows without ttyctl -f after running tclsh?  I guess you also have
to use ftp with readline to get this problem.  Could you reprocude the
problem starting zsh with the -f option?
