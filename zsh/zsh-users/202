Hi,

I've been using zsh for over a year now, but it seems that it has
recently come to the attention of the sysadmin who wants me to stop
using it on the grounds that "it is not a supported shell" on the
machines I work on.

I'm hesistant to give up zsh and all its great functions, which I've
come to depend upon, so I was hoping some of you could give me some
specific examples of how zsh has not caused problems for you sysadmins
out here.

I need to make a pretty convincing argument if I'm going to keep this
thing.  Any help appreciated.
