I'm configuring zsh for the first time and trying to understand the 
features.

I find menu completion very useful, and I like seeing the list of candidates 
below it. <tab><tab><tab> yes, that's the one I want<enter>, and it 
executes.

Then I found menu *selection*, which let me see where I was as I tabbed thru 
the candidates by highlighting where I am in the list, which is very 
convenient. Unfortunately, when I reach the one I want and hit <enter>, it 
no longer executes. Now it just inserts a space and sits there waiting for 
me to enter more. I have to hit enter again to make it execute.

I like being able to see where I am on the list more than tabbing thru it 
blindly, and I like being able to navigate particularly long lists by using 
the arrow keys (very nice), but how do I get it to execute when I hit 
<enter> the first time, just the way it does when I'm tabbing thru the list 
without highlighting? If I want to enter two parameters -- which is the 
minority of cases -- I should be able to just hit the spacebar and start 
tabbing again the way I can when the "selection" highlighting is turned off, 
I would think.

Can menu completion with selection turned on be made to execute on the first 
tab like it can with selection turned off?

Thanks.
