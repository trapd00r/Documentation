No then you simply add a built-in test to zsh that is true iff that
argument is a text file.  No extra exec-s, but still clean.

But you apparently can't even attribute text in emails properly.

The point isn't whether I could figure out such a line, it's whether
being able to throw together nonsensical characters correctly after 8
attempts proves anything.  Yes, zsh can [almost] do it, but it's way
easier to just use find or a cmd-line filter that removes arguments that
aren't text files.
