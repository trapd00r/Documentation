That's because you're running the "sched" unconditionally to schedule
a new task, even if the function is called from precmd.  It would
definitely be better to avoid that.  You can delete any existing
scheduled job with something like:

sched | while read line; do
  if [[ $line = *clear-zle-screen* ]]; then
    sched -${line%% *}
  fi
done

(It would be nice if sched provided an array to access scheduled events
but it doesn't.  That's an easy tweak I may look at.)
