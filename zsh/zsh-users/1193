Not directly, I think, but the mailing lists also appear on web pages, which 
seems like a probable way they might have got hold of email addresses.  It 
seems improbable that anybody would bother going through mailing lists 
nowadays (it's just too awkward, I'd have thought), but it's known that people 
do web crawling.
