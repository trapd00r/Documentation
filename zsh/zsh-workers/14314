Subject: PATCH: cygwin stat code (again)
Date: Fri, 11 May 2001 13:54:41 +0100
From: Peter Stephenson <pws@csr.com>

I sent this before, but it seems to have gorn.  I believe we've been having
problems with outgoing mail and it doesn't seem to be in the mailing list
archive.

mflags in stat under cygwin shouldn't be const, since it needs to be
initialised at run time.
