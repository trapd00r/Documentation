I can't tell, probably not. 

Best would probably be to do a quick search for (f) and (s:...:)
in /usr/share/zsh to see if any of them rely on that.

I can see for instance:

4.3.4/functions/Completion/Unix/_java_class:for i in "${(s.:.)classpath}"; do

But in that case, it probably is more correct (if CLASSPATH is
meant to behave like PATH) to not strip the empty elements.

I agree with you that not removing the empty elements at that
stage makes more sense, given that it can be done later on by
not using @+quoting...
