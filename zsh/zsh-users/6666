Hello people,

When running V01zmodload.ztst in an environment with a profiling enabled
gcc, zsh hangs burning 99.9% CPU. Adding an strace to the process gives
no output at all.

So I was wondering how to enable some kind of debug info to the module
in order to have it e.g. print how far it gets, in order to nail down
what causes the loop?
