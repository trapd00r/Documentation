Not yet. We have this `discussion' (well, at least we mentioned it
already) about giving information about the `current' state to
completion widgets. I.e. information like `there is already a se of
matches', `the matches are listed', etc. Then we would like to have a
way to say what should be done with this list (`ignore it, build a new 
one', `use it, but do ... next', etc). Anyone who wants to think about 
this is welcome.

For further information, see 5479, 5501, 5551 and probably others I
have forgotten.

Bye
 Sven
