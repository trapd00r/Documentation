These lines work for me, too.
But they probably have to, as the FAQ says:
   be sure your .zshrc defines all of your
   aliases before it defines any of your functions.

So the problem probably starts when there are more aliases after the
definition of bar.  I'll attach my (lengthy) .zsh/alias file.  Please try it.

That's one solution.  Using mutt is another. :-)

Thanks,
