Hiya,

I had an odd behavior here.

~$ a() echo foo
~$ vared functions\[a\]\
        echo foobar
zsh: not an identifier: functions[a]
~$ dpkg -l | grep zsh
ii  zsh-beta                             4.3.4-dev-4+20071212-1      A shell with lots of features (dev tree)

Above, the trailing "\ " was added by the completion system.

Still, vared showed me the content of $functions[a]. I would
have expected it to return with an error before (well instead
of) allowing me to edit the content.

Same goes for:

a=foo
vared "a "

Not a big issue, though.

Cheers,
Stephane
