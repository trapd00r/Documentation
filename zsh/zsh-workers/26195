Please don't CC 276187@bugs.debian.org any more -- my fault for mixing
two bugs into one email. Won't happen again.

doing the 'right' thing and suspending {1;2;3} :
ksh93

swallowing 3 :
bash, csh, fish,

running 3 the second 2 is suspended:
ash, dash

freezing the whole shell:
Solaris 9 /bin/sh

not allowing you to suspend within a command chain at all:
ksh88

not catching ^Z and suspending themselves; when stopped from
another shell, they do:
posh :
  runs 3 the second 2 is suspended
sash :
  does the 'right' thing and suspends {1;2;3}

being so weird i had to kill the shell from outside:
scsh
