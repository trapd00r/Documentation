That seems like a good idea. The only other thing I can think of is
another precommand modifier - noalias, like noglob.

I remember that actually. I'm undecided on it myself because source -U
would be useful. Incidentally, tcsh has a -h option to source (but no
options to eval). I suppose a noalias option would avoid the need for a
source -U.
