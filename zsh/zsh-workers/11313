} Does anybody really use ^G to switch from menu selection to menu

} really cancel selection and revert line to it's original state (before
} match was inserted). This is also consistent behaviour for ^G, that
} normally cancels actions in other places.

I, too, would prefer this behavior.
 
} As a related (to me at least) question or request - is it possible to

We discussed that, but I don't recall whether it's possible.  The doc
for the `menu' style doesn't mention it.

} OTOH if menu selection can be quit with ^G it can be
} used as replacement for listing, but replacement that supports scrolling,
} paging, going back etc.

Listing already supports scrolling; set the LISTPROMPT parameter.  There's
a list-prompt style, too.
