Using current CVS ^Z behaves weird. Pressing ^Z has no visible effect; but if
I press ^D after ^Z program is suspended and, of course, immediately termnated
after fg:

mw1g017@MW1G17C% md5sum
               <= ^Z^D here
zsh: suspended  md5sum
mw1g017@MW1G17C% fg
[1]  + continued  md5sum
d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e *-
mw1g017@MW1G17C%

This works in bash so it does not look like cygwin bug (but may be bad
interaction with cygwin of course).
