Hi All,

I am Pavan, I am working at a company called Symbian, we make a Smart 
Phone OS called symbian.
I am trying to port Zsh to Symbian, though Symbian does not supprt direct 
native posix api's we have a platform called P.I.P.S
which provides subset of Posix APIs. Could someone please tell me if and 
how i can get access to the Zsh design document as just going 
through the code i am not able to understand anything substantial.

Thanks in advance.

Regards,
Pavan
