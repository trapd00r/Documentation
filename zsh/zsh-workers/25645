Hello!

I'm attempting to determine what could cause zsh to provide this error:

Sep  4 02:13:51 gts018 zsh: [ID 288304 kern.warning] WARNING: zsh: clone 
device 2 must be attached before use!

Reviewing the source, it looks like that the user is attempting to write 
to a queue using zsh_wput() and that intended device is both null and 
the mblk is not of the M_PROTO type.

Is there any better way to determine the device? (Yes, I know, ask the 
user...they are... uncommunicative on the matter.)

my thanks in advance, and please, reply to this mail as I am not 
subscribed to the list.

-Ben.
