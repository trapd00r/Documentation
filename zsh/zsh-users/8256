Anyone have a better version of zsh.vim?  The version that comes with
vim 6.3 is ok, but could be much better.  It has a few bugs, like
unmatched single quotes within double quotes, confuse it.   Also, it's
missing some standard keywords (e.g. repeat, until, foreach, select). 
 It would be nice if it recognized completion related functions,
variables, syntax (e.g. #compdef lines).  The _chown completion
function exhibits some of the problems.
