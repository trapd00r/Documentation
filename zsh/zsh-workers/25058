} It's possible --enable-zsh-mem has simply had it's day.

The only major problem I'd *expect* with zsh-mem is one of getting
the alignment right.  But if that were failing I'd expect the errors
you see to be less random.  Unless you seem to be hitting them most
often in cases where the allocated blocks could be getting entirely
filled up?  Maybe reading/writing part way into the header of the
next (or an unallocated) block?

Although I'd think writing like that would cause a crash in pretty
short order ...
