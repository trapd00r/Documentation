	First, Tcl has got to have the ugliest syntax of any language known to
man.  Second, Tk is a very poor rip-off of Motif and almost as ugly as Athena.
What I'm talking about is something that actually allows X/Xt/Motif calls from
within the shell (a la dtksh).  This wouldn't be zsh but a parallel and
derivate
work ( wzsh ).  This, of course, would best be accomplished through a dynamic
(or even not so dynamic) extension interface for adding builtins.  These
changes would be similar to the ones made for ksh93 in support of dtksh.

	Yes,  dtksh is based off Korn Shell 93 and source code is not freely
available AFAIK.
