} I've never seen zsh report exit status on jobs in the foreground before.

Happens only with both the `monitor' and `printexitvalue' options set,
and then only for commands that exit nonzero.  I think `printexitvalue'
is a relatively new option, but I'm not sure (I've never set it).

By the way, workers, what's up with `monitor'?

    MONITOR (-m, ksh: -m)
	 Allow job control.  Set by default in interactive shells.

> exec zsh -l
zagzig[21] setopt | grep monitor
monitor             off
