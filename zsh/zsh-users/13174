You can probably do it with some for-looping, like
setopt shortloops
% for a in white black; for b in fish bird; for c in {21..24}; echo $a$b$c
whitefish21
whitefish22
whitefish23
whitefish24
whitebird21
whitebird22
whitebird23
whitebird24
blackfish21
blackfish22
blackfish23
blackfish24
blackbird21
blackbird22
blackbird23
blackbird24

Now you can just swap the order of the loops
% for b in fish bird; for a in white black; for c in {21..24}; echo $a$b$c
whitefish21
whitefish22
whitefish23
whitefish24
blackfish21
blackfish22
blackfish23
blackfish24
whitebird21
whitebird22
whitebird23
whitebird24
blackbird21
blackbird22
blackbird23
blackbird24
