Oh.  Believe it or not, that's intentional.  It was only changed recently
in 3.1.5-pws-something when a whole slew of other commands were also added
to the set of actions that completely clear the completion listing.

Geoff can say for sure, but I think that's a side-effect of writing code
that works OK on terminals whose termcap/info entries lie about the way
automargin behaves on the last line of the display.

In short, I don't think either of these counts as a bug.
