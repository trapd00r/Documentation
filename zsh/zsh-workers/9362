Sometimes completion after ../ frustrates me.

For example:

Z:akr@crane% mkdir -p z/tstdir
Z:akr@crane% cd z/tstdir
Z:akr@crane% ls ..        
tstdir
Z:akr@crane% ls ../<TAB>

->

Z:akr@crane% ls ../tstdir/

Since there is only one caondidate `tstdir', zsh completes it.  It is
consistent behaviour.  But I want to list instead of completion
because ../tstdir is not useful --- it's current working directory.

I think it is useful that a style to control this behaviour: list
files even if there is only one completion candidate when previous
path component is `..'.
