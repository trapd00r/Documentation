I think, this changed first in 3.1.x; I don't have 3.0.x to test it.

the list of choices is not cleared after completion is done. Consider

zsh -f
itsrm2% pg M<TAB>
Makefile     MkKernOpts*  Mksrc*
<TAB>
itsrm2% pg Makefile
Makefile     MkKernOpts*  Mksrc*

If I now enter SPACE, I get

itsrm2% pg Makefile <= cursor here
Makefile     MkKernOpts*  Mksrc*

I definitely remember being surprised seeing it for the first time. Is it
intentional? It is not a big deal I admit, but what is the reason?

TIA
