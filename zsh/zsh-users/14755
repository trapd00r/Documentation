Subject: WinZsh (native Windows port of zsh) resurrected
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1; format=flowed
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

I would like to announce that the old native Windows port of zsh by Amol 
Deshpande has been resurrected, relicensed under the 3-clause BSD 
license, and given a new home on Sourceforge.net. You can find it at 
[1]. Please try it out and report any bugs you find on the Sourceforge 
trackers.

If you are interested in helping with development please feel free to 
contact me.  I am a fairly novice C programmer, but trying to learn 
quickly, and any assistance is welcome. The biggest priority right now 
is getting the code to compile under a modern compiler, preferably MinGW.

I'm not sure who maintains the FAQ, but it would be great if it could be 
updated with the new location of WinZsh. Also, I noted that the FAQ 
version on Sourceforge [2] is out of date compared with the version 
currently distributed with zsh.

Thanks,
Tim Ayres
