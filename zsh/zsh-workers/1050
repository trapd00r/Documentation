OK, I've updated the zsh web page, both the list at,

      http://www.mal.com/zsh/Arc/list.html

and the descriptive section at,

      http://www.mal.com/zsh/Arc/mirrors.shtml

The list is probably too long. Any suggestions for condensing it
(list.html)? Sub-lists?

Appended is a text representation of the descriptive list. There are
more sites here than Zoltan lists; I believe most are still actively
mirroring either math.gatech or Zoltan's master. Does anyone see any
errors or corrections needed. Is the RG&E site still registered?

Also, I'm tempted to lose the IP numbers, and just use the domain
names -- would that bother anyone?
