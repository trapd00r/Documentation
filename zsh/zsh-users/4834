You're not quite right.  matcher-list is used only at the global level,
not for individual tags like all-files.  For an individual tag, you want
to use just the 'matcher' style:

 zstyle ':completion:*:all-files' matcher 'm:{a-zA-Z}={A-Za-z}'

Unfortunately, there appears to be a bug in _path_files -- it copies any
global matcher from matcher-list through to the call to compfiles, but it
doesn't do the same for a matcher passed to it with the -M option (which
is where the string from the matcher style ends up).

Unfortunately I don't see offhand how to fix this.  Sven?
