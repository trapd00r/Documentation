Well, unless I've missed a message, we are still waiting for Geoff's
nicefication of the code in zrefresh() that clears the list. If his
version is as simple to use (trigger it by just setting clearlist to
non-zero), I could then easily produce a patch to call this in the
appropriate places.

(Geoff said he didn't like the look of it...)
