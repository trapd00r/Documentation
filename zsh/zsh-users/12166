} also, i've got this in my ~/.zshrc:

} which causes a problem on solaris... instead of:
}  	rm -rf /junk
} i have to do this:
}  	command rm -rf /junk
} 
} is there a better way to assign that alias to rm if i'm on solaris?

I have

    alias RM="/bin/rm"

and then if "rm" starts prompting me when it shouldn't, ^C^P^A^[u
gets it cranking along properly.  (Assuming you're a "bindkey -e".)
