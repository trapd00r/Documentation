Not with compctl, but somebody has a patch to do it.  It was rejected
for the standard release in favour of (one day) dynamically loadable
extensions to do this kind of thing.  I don't remember the URL for the
patches, unfortunately.  I'm sure somebody can, or you could search the
mail archives.

Sure.  Look at the %{..%} codes.  For example, I have

PS1="%{$(print -n '\e[46;34;1m')%}%@, %D{%A %d %B} %m%#%{$(print -n '\e[m')%} "
