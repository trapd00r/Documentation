Possibly, but most completion strings spend most of their life metafied.
In zrefresh() characters come in as (wide) characters for display;
completion lists, however, are initially metafied multibyte strings which
need to be unmetafied.  clnicezputs(), compzputs() and compnicezputs()
handle this character by character.  So it's normal to unmetafy at the last
possible moment.  Their may well be other special cases.
