} I got the following to work

A couple of minor adjustments:

    predict-on() {
	zle -N self-insert insert-and-predict
	zle -N magic-space insert-and-predict
    }
    predict-off() {
	zle -A .self-insert self-insert
	zle -A .magic-space magic-space
    }

The whole idea is actually pretty cool.

} It's interesting what happens if you get predict-off wrong.

I'll bet, especially considering that you did.
