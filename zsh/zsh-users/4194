so this may be a dumb question, but i haven't been able to find any
documentation that addresses this. 

i installed my own terminfo directory in $HOME/share/terminfo
in bash, i can do:

[sepia]$ echo $TERMINFO
/home/will/share/terminfo
[sepia]$ export TERM=xterm-xfree86
[sepia]$ echo $TERM
xterm-xfree86

but in zsh:
sepia% echo $TERMINFO
/home/will/share/terminfo
sepia% export TERM=xterm-xfree86
zsh: can't find termcap info for xterm-xfree86
ˆ‰%

this machine doesn't have zsh so i'm running zsh from $HOME/bin/
did i need to tell zsh the location of terminfo when i compiled it? do i
just need to set different environment variables?

if termcap is needed, i have a current copy of that in $HOME/etc/termcap

i'm having the same problem with tcsh, so i'm assuming there's just some
variable i need to set.
