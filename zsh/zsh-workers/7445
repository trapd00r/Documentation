Some more information would have been nice...

I guess you are using the complist module (probably statically linked
in?). Then the `$<2>' strings would either come from the value of
ZLS_COLORS or ZLS_COLOURS if one of them is set, or -- more probably,
as I think you don't have them set -- it would come zsh's attempt to
find out the terminal code for end-of-standout-mode.

Of course, I don't get it, so all this is guessing.

Could you tell us what `print -P "%s"' gives you? If it gives you
`$<2>' then it is indeed that zsh thinks that this is the terminal
code mentioned above. If you get something different and you don't
have any of those parameters set, it must be something else -- and I
don't know what.

Bye
 Sven
