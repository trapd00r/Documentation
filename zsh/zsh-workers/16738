Looks good to me.  Though am seeing an error with the value completions.  While
the redirs and normal completion don't seem to have a problem. 

host@ TZ=<TAB>
_normal:74: division by zero
host@ DISPLAY=<TAB>
_normal:74: ':' without '?'

_normal:74:service="${${(e):-\$${__services}[$_comp_command1]}:-$_comp_command1}"

-FR.
