Subject: Comments on new style completion


Thinking some more about Andrej's suggestions for `_path_files' I
thought about making this user-configurable and then was reminded
about Peter's comment about passing options to the completion code.

Maybe we should add a (or more than one) associative array(s), nicely
putting everything into one basket, e.g.:

  compconfig[dump_file]        what is now COMPDUMP
  compconfig[correct]          COMPCORRECT
  compconfig[correct_prompt]   CCPROMPT
  compconfig[correct_orig]     CCORIG (may be extensible to: show the
                               original string as the first/last `match')

Then we could have keys for different `styles' that should be used by
various functions, e.g.:

  compconfig[path_style]       say how `_path_files' should behave

Here I would prefer `compstyle[paths]=...'.


And since I already mentiond the correction stuff: should we change
this so that the maximum number of errors allowed is less than or
equal to the number of characters in the word to complete (or that
plus one)?


Bye
 Sven
