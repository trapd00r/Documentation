This is a useful idea, but you have a whole function scope to play with.
No need to resort to expanding strings from the history.

  set -- "${(@z)BUFFER}"
  BUFFER="gdb $argv[1] -x =(print -r run ${(q)argv[2-]})"
  zle accept-line

If you want the original line to appear in the history, insert

  print -s -- "$@"

after the "set" command.
