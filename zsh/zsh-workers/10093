} Why docs does not tell, what those so called literal escape sequences mean
} and how they they differ from other kind of escape sequences?

Yes, there's probably a bit of a problem with context there.  In prompts,
"escape sequence" means "sequence of characters, often beginning with an
ASCII 27, that are interpreted by terminals to change display properties."

Oliver's answered the rest of your questions, I see.
