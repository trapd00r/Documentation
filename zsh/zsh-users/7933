The '\C' prefix is meaningless, and ignored, for characters outside the 
range a-z (or A-Z).  It's a shortcut for an ASCII value, not a shortcut
for (e.g.) an X11 key event.

Whether Ctrl-Enter is meaningful depends entirely on your terminal or 
emulator, and probably either sends a plain return, or sends a multi-
character sequence like a function key would.  You need to find out what
it sends and bind to _that_.
