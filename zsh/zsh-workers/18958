Subject: PATCH: _perforce change completion

Completion after `p4 change' only allows pending changes.  This is too
draconian if you are the superuser using -f or if you are simply
outputting a previous change with -o.

I also mis-described `p4 change -d' as describing rather than discarding
pending changes.

(Yes, I am finally installing a Perforce archive here.)
