i used the "search OSDN" function on freshmeat, looking for "bash
completion".  this had more than 100 hits, i gave up too early,
obviously.

that would be a very good idea!  of course the one taking a stab at
this should first try it out.  of somebody finds a _portable_
version, i'd be glad to at least report on which predictions return
the most value for the users.  actually, the version i once had was
way too slow, but i think markov-chains are much better suited for
todays XXXX-GHz CPUs otherwise idling away ...
