Heyla,
 here are some spell fixes for Etc/*  (excluding FAQ) based on 3.0.1-test2

***************
*** 6,12 ****
  If you suspend "man", zle seems to get into cooked mode.  It works ok
  for plain "less".
  It is not specific neither to man nor to zsh.
! E.g. call the fallowing program foo:
  #include <sys/wait.h>
  #include <unistd.h>

*** 24,35 ****
  from zsh/bash, zle/readline gets into cooked mode.
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  % zsh -c 'cat a_long_file | less ; :'
! can be interrupted with ^C. The prompt comes back and less is orphaed.
  If you go to the end of the file with less and cat terminates, ^C
  will not terminate less. The `; :' after less forces zsh to fork before
  executing less.
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
! The pattern %?* maches names beginning with %? instead of names with at
  least two characters beginning with %. This is a hack to allow %?foo job
  substitution without quoting. This behaviour is incompatible with sh
  and ksh and may be removed in the future. A good fix would be to keep

*** 7,21 ****
  this release.  If you feel that you or someone else have been unfairly
  omitted from this list please mail me (hzoli@cs.elte.hu).
  
! * Richard Coleman <coleman@math.gatech.edu> manintained the code till the
    release of zsh-2.6-beta16.  Converted zsh to use autoconf thus greatly
    improving the portability.  Rewrote signal handling code.  Reorganized
    internal hash tables and rewrote the related builtins (enable, disable,
    hash, unhash).  Made some cleanups in exec.c.
  
! * Zoltán Hidvégi <hzoli@cs.elte.hu> the current maintainer.  Rewrore most
    of the lexer and substitution and the related completion code.  Improved
!   sh/ksh/POSIX comapibility.  Fixed lots of bugs in completion, parameter
    and history code.  Made zsh fully 8-bit clean.  Made some
    reorganizations in exec.c.  Fixed signal handling bugs.  Fixed lots of
    bugs in various places.

! 	The strip comming with gcc-2.7.2 seems to create unusable
  	binaries.  This problem is not related to zsh.  If you have such
! 	problems, remove the bogous strip and use /bin/strip instead.

  SUN:	SunOS 4.1.x
  	Should build `out-of-the-box'.
  	Under 4.1.3 if yellow pages is used, username completion
! 	may cause segmentation violaton.  This is a bug in the
  	shared library not in zsh.  Some libc.so.1.9.x has this
  	bug (it fails in yp_all).  Statically linked binaries will
  	work if linked with libc.so.1.8.1 (which means that if
  	you can get a statically linked binary compiled under 4.1.2
  	that it will probably work).
! 	An altermative but untested solution may be to undefine
  	HAVE_NIS in config.h.  This may work, but the first username
! 	completion will be _very_ solw (as slow as in tcsh).
  
  	Solaris 2.x

*** 3,9 ****
  Much improved sh/ksh emulation.  When zsh is invoked as sh it mostly
  conforms to POSIX 1003.2.
  
! Enhaced parameter expansion features: new flags: A, @, e, W, p, f, F.
  Expansions can be nested.  For example,
  "${${(M)${(f@)$(<builtin.pro)}:#char*}[2][(w)3]}" expands to the third
  word of the second line of builtin.pro which begins with char.  See
