Yes, mea culpa. I did mean "as if LOCAL_OPTIONS were set". IOW restore=20
options to the values they had before emulate command.

Unfortunately this one probably would be the most confusing=20
implementation. This effectively results in options values after emulate=20
that corresponds neither to options values before, nor to options set by=20
commands inside of emulate -c.

If user has changed any of the option that is touched by emulate (and=20
emulate -R would touch every option) before executing emulate -c, return=20
from emulate -c would wipe out all changes.

We could try to interpret this as "set of options that were in effect=20
before emulate -c as adjusted by options explicitly changed by command".=20
This is doable, but this immediately poses another question - what to do=20
with emulation mode set inside emulate -c?

Extreme example: emulate sh -c "emulate -R csh"

if we retain options set by "emulate -R csh" on exit from top level=20
emulate, we effectively have options for csh emulation, but emulation=20
itself is reset to whatever was in effect before (just in case -=20
emulation is *not* limited to options unfortunately).

So I still tend to leave things as is (making documentation more clear)=20
and if we ever need different behaviour, better add explicit option for=20
it.
