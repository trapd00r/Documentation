} When I set path as an array, the value is reflected in the uppercase PATH
} environment variable:
} 
}     $ path=(one two three)
}     $ echo $PATH
} 
} However, this doesn't work for (most) other variables

PATH and path are "special" variables which zsh handles internally.  The
same is true of FPATH/fpath and a couple of others.

There's no facility for linking an arbitrary pair of variables this way
in any released version of zsh.  This linking feature was added very
recently by a patch to the 3.1.x development version of zsh, but AFAIK
that version has never been ported to Windows.
