I tried analysing this sometime in December.  I saw what now appears to
be a typo, tried to figure it out, and got lost trying to figure out
where it was being called from.  There's one place which used the array
in a specific condition (don't have zsh sources available now, sorry),
and I couldn't manage to trigger the condition.

'fgrep' and 'tags' are your friends.  ;^)

Thinking about this, I should have mentioned it then.  Sorry.
