Yes it is, read the documentation.

I disagree.  There's no rule that Functions/Zle contains only widgets,
just that it contains functions relevant to Zle.  If you look in
config.modules, it lists functions associated with particular modules by
directory so you can choose to include them or not.  If those start
being split up between directories things are going to get very
confusing.
