as if there wasn't enough information already in my prompt...

zsh-prompt-cd-color.png : when changing directories show the $PWD in a 
brighter color. this supports 256 colors, if available, and should serve 
as an example of how to make other elements of the prompt support 256 
colors but still fall-back to something safe.

why? so after i cd into a new directory i have a brighter than usual PWD 
so i can double check and make sure it's correct.
