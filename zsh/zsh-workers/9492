} The problem is that the default tag is tested in _main_complete which
} doesn't add a context name

This seems an important point to me.  Is there a listing somewhere of
the tags which are tested in _main_complete, or is "default" the only
one?  At the least the doc for the default tag should mention this.

That means this example from the doc is wrong, does it not?

     To be able to share the same specifications one has set up for the
     GNU version of the ls command one can use:

          zstyle ':completion:*:default' list-colors ${(s.:.)LS_COLORS}
                             ^^^

BTW, I hope the intention is to put a lot more zstyle examples into the
docs before final release.
