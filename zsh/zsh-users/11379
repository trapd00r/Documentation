Most Unix tools (cut, paste, sed, awk...) read files lines by
line, it's generally a bad idea to have the shell read the file
by itself.

No, read without any option has a special meaning to the shell

while IFS= read -r theline

Same thing for echo.

echo -E - $theline # zsh specific
print -r -- "$theline" # ksh/zsh specific

or POSIXLY:

printf '%s\n' "$theline"

But don't do it, there's probably a much better way to do what
you want to achieve.
