...most of patch snipped for conciseness...

As this was reported on 4.2.6, I figured you'd want it on the 4.2
branch as well.  However the entire patch doesn't merge cleanly,
due to zerrmsg having its signature changed in 4.3 (with a FILE
pointer as the first parameter).  It seemed obvious enough to change
`file' in the above hunk to `stderr', so I've committed that to the
zsh-4_2-patches branch.
