[...]

It can't be that simple though, as in

x=-1; $((1 x))

which would be POSIX but fails in all shells.

Or

x=1; $((x = 1 + x))

which obviously is not meant to be the same as $(($x = 1 + $x))

So that

  If the shell variable x contains a value that forms a valid
  integer constant, then the arithmetic expansions "$((x))" and
  "$(($x))" shall return the same value.

says either too little or too much to be useful.
