This adds minimal support for Pyramid man system (used on
SINIX/ReliantUNIX from Siemens-then-SNI-then-Siemens-then-FSC :-) Manual
directory is expected to have mandb file where first word is manual page
and second word section (there are actually more). 1M is standard
section in SVR4 - so I thought I'd add it as well.

Attached because of line length.
