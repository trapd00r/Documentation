I have found the following problem with globbing of symlinks pointing
to a directory:
Script started on Fri Jun 07 20:15:00 1996
jagor% ls -l
total 4
lrwxrwxrwx   1 hniksic  f2             1 Jun  7 20:14 somefile -> /
-rw-r--r--   1 hniksic  f2            43 Jun  7 20:15 typescript
jagor% cd s*e/
cd: no such file or directory: s*e/
jagor% cd s*e
jagor% /bin/pwd
/

That is, when symlink points to a directory, it will not be globbed if
it has a trailing /. This is especially annoying when writing
something like:
jagor% cd site-lisp/g*a/lisp
and it fails (although g*a completes uniquely by itself in site-lisp
directory), because gnus-beta is a symbolic link to gnus-5.2.10.

Ksh and bash do not seem to have this problem, whereas plain sh
behaves like zsh.
