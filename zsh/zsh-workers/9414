Ouch. The patch should fix this.

I have several problems with this. First, at least for me, this is
probably quite irritating. Second: how to do it. It is possible, of
course, but we would have to set some flag when parent directories
have been ignored, and test that flag at the very end of completion
because only then do we know if there is only one match. I.e. the code 
for it would be scattered between _path_files and, say, _main_complete. 

Maybe it is enough if we add a special value to ignore_parents so that 
the special-dirs (`..' and `.' are added to the alternate set if there 
were ignored directories (we could also do that only if ignore-parents 
leaves the normal set empty and the alternate set with only one
string, but if _path_files is called more than once or any other
completion function is called, the result may again be not what one
wants).

Or maybe we write a completer (a real, top-level completer) that
registers a post-completion function which checks if there are only
alternate matches (or only one alternate match) and no normal one and, 
if this is the case, makes a list be shown instead of the match(es) be 
used. That would be quite easy (set compstate[insert]='',
compstate[list]='list force'), , but I'm not sure if this is enough or 
the right thing at all.
