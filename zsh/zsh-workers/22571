ah well, yes of course.  it just seemed odd that a subshell which is not =
reading commands from stdin will be interactive.

For example, (pushd) will print the dirstack.  On the other hand, (fc) wi=
ll output the recent history, without being interactive it is unhappy, bu=
t I don't see much reason calling fc from a subshell.
