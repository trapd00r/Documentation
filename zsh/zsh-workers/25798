It seems that zsh 4.3.6 suffers from a buffering problem when pasting
long lines under Mac OS X (at least 10.4.11). Other software, such as
bash and emacs (running in a terminal), does not seem to have such a
problem.

For instance, when I paste

/usr/bin/gcc-4.0 -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I. -I.. -DGNOMELOCALEDIR=3D\"/opt/local/s=
hare/locale\" -DGNOME_DESKTOP_SYSCONFDIR=3D\"/opt/local/etc\" -DGNOME_DESKT=

(1507 characters) to iTerm running zsh, I get:

/usr/bin/gcc-4.0 -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I. -I.. -DGNOMELOCALEDIR=3D\"/opt/local/s=

nclude/libgnome-2.0 -I/opt/local/include/libbonoboui-2.0 -I/o

which corresponds to the first 1024 characters. If I paste to xterm
(also running zsh), I get something like:

/usr/bin/gcc-4.0 -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I. -I.. -DGNOMELOCALEDIR=3D\"/opt/local/s=

de/libgnomecanvas-2.0 -I/opt/local/include/gnome-vfs-2.0 -I/opt/local/lib/g=
nome-vfsde/olu-MT

(here 1130 characters, but this varies).

I don't know if this is related, but I've just discovered that
"cooked mode" (e.g. after typing "cat") is limited to 1024 characters
(including the final newline) under Mac OS X!
