} As far as I'm concerned a nimrod is (a) a hunter mentioned in Genesis

``... the first who claimed to be a "mighty one in the earth."'' according
to Easton's 1897 Bible Dictionary (see http://www.dict.org/).

Hence a nimrod is someone who overestimates his own power or ability.  I
don't remember where I first heard that usage ...

} but if someone wants to do that that's fine by me.
