Sounds reasonable, but is well beyond my expertise in zsh's code.

Yes I've seen it, too. But I'd like to have `warn_create_global' active
while vcs_info is running (without cutting off useful features such as
zstyle's "-e" option), if possible. It's code should run fine with the
option set. And having it set prevents me from becoming sloppy.
