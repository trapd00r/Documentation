Subject: 3.1.7-pre-1: Problem with scrolled completion listings
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

The easiest way to see this is to cd into the Src directory of a zsh build
tree on an 80x24 terminal; make sure .syms .epro and .pro are NOT ignored
(see my options and styles below) and then type

% ls <TAB>

This fills the screen with a listing ending with

  Current position at Top       Continue?

Hit TAB again to get back to the prompt, then again to start menu selection.
Now there's again a screenful, ending with

  Scrolling active: current selection at Top

(in reverse video).  Hit TAB repeatedly (21 times, to be exact) and note
that the selection disappears, and you're now stuck repeatedly selecting
the file name that would be visible if only the status line weren't there.
The status line now says something like

  Scrolling active: current selection at 62%

Pressing one of the arrow keys restores sanity.

Aside: Why is "Current position ... Continue?" NOT in reverse video?  Why
whitespace rather than a colon between "Top" and "Continue" ?  Am I just
being a foolishly consistent hobgoblin to want these to look similar?
