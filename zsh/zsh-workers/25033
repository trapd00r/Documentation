In the script attached, when trying to follwing line always fails.

     zpty -r scppty line "*:" || echo "no password asked" && exit

It appears that the "password" string from the ssh session is discarded
by the psuedo terminal.

Is there a way to fix this? or Am I missing something?

Thanks,

Jaime
