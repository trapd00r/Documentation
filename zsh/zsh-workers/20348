This sounds reasonable.  It's easier to make WIDGETSTYLE set to the
empty string for zle -N widgets, rather than unset, since otherwise we
need to set up the parameters differently for the two types.  However,
it would be possible to post process the list to unset it.  (Not setting
up the variable at all isn't an option since then we can't guarantee
it's unset.)  I think it's OK as it is, however, since it gives you an
easy test.
