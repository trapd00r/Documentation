===================

you can also sprinkle some magic on that, and it still looks portable...

error () {
 	print "something went wrong on line ${1}" >&2
 	exit $[ (${1} - 1) % 127 + 1 ]
}
  cd foo		|| error ${LINENO}
  cd foobar	|| error ${LINENO}
  cd baz		|| error ${LINENO}

the extra math in the exit value would help identify the line that failed 
using the exit status, but keep the value within a sane range. for scripts 
shorter than 127 lines "exit ${1}" would suffice.

i ~think~ 127 is the correct value for the mod operation, keeping the exit 
status within the range of 1-127, and than wrapping. i'm sure someone here 
can point out if 128 or even 255 is a reasonable value.
