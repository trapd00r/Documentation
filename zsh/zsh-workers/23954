Oops. -s outputs strings to a window. Perhaps -c and -s should be
combined.

We could delay the initscr() to the first invocation of the zcurses
builtin, but I'm not sure how much more friendly that is.

+COMMENT(!MOD!zsh/curses
+curses windowing commands
+!MOD!)
+The tt(zsh/curses) module makes available one builtin command:
+
+startitem()
+findex(zcurses)
+cindex(windows, curses)
+xitem(tt(zcurses) tt(-a) var(nlines) var(ncols) var(begin_y) var(begin_x) var(targetwin) )
+xitem(tt(zcurses) tt(-d) var(targetwin) )
+xitem(tt(zcurses) tt(-r) var(targetwin) )
+xitem(tt(zcurses) tt(-m) var(targetwin) var(new_y) var(new_x) )
+xitem(tt(zcurses) tt(-c) var(targetwin) var(character) )
+xitem(tt(zcurses) tt(-s) var(targetwin) var(string) )
+item(tt(zcurses) tt(-b) var(targetwin) var(border) )(
+Manipulate curses windows.
+
+With tt(-a), create a window with var(nlines) lines and var(ncols) columns.
+Its upper left corner will be placed at row var(begin_y) and column
+var(begin_x) of the screen.  var(targetwin) must be an integer between 1
+and 9 inclusive, and refer to a window that is not currently assigned.
+
+Use tt(-d) to delete a window created with tt(-a).
+
+The tt(-r) command will refresh window var(targetwin); this is necessary to
+make any pending changes (such as characters you have prepared for output
+with tt(-c)) visible on the screen.
+
+tt(-m) moves var(targetwin) to new coordinates var(new_y) and var(new_x).
+
+Outputting characters and strings are achieved by tt(-c) and tt(-s)
+respectively.
+
+To draw a border around window var(targetwin), use tt(-b).
