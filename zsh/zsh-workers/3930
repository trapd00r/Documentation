Those should still work, since you're dealing with actual filenames.
In the first case, you're globbing in either zsh version.  The second
one would be more efficient as "${TTY:t}" in either version.

Simplification -- parens trigger globbing.  The only casualty is the
`foo(:mods)' syntax, where `foo' is not a filename.  We gain the ability
to do `foo(.)' etc.
