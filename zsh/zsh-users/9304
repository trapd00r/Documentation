    I've found a possible solution, quick and dirty but it works. The
only problem is that it's a bit messy, but probably you can 'clean'
it a bit O:) It implies an array assignment, but I have no problem
with that because the output is still human readable and using an
array allows me to review the list before using it:

    array=(`print -- ${(j.:.)list}`)
    du -s ${(s.:.)array)

    The "print" part gives us a list with items separated by ':' (I
must find a char that won't be part of the filenames, anyway. ':' is
a very good candidate, but...), and when using we have to undo the
change and do the splitting. It's a bit messy, but at least it works.
There must be a much cleaner solution, but I can't think of one now
:( It's possible to do the above without having to use the split when
using the array? I know I can do this:

    array=(${(s.:.):-`print -- ${(j.:.)list}`})

    equivalent to, in real usage, to:

    array=(${(s.:.):-`myscript args`})

    But I would like to have a simpler assignment...

    Thanks a lot in advance :)
