Subject: How to specify characters to escape with _files

Mkisofs(1) allows you to specify what is called "graft points" that
say how a file in the image filesystem should map to files on the
source filesystem.  The syntax is <image-file>=<source-file>.  To
allow EQUALS SIGNs in the filenames, the EQUALS SIGN can be escaped by
a REVERSE SOLIDUS (a backslash, that is).  Backslashes are already
handled by the completion system, but how do I tell it to also escape
any EQUALS SIGNs in the possible completions?

Thanks!
