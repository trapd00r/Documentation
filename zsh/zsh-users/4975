  Well, I'm pretty new to zsh, but I may be able to field this one. =20

% bindkey ^[.
"^[." insert-last-word
%

  So it looks like you just need to run something like:

bindkey "=1B." insert-last-word

  Note that the ^[ represents an actual escape character.  So before you
hit M-. you need to hit Ctrl-v so zsh inserts it literally.
  By the way, thanks for pointing out this feature!

  Oh, and while I'm posting anyway, is there a way to disable zsh's
reports that mail has been read in a mailbox?  I don't want to disable
the reports of _new_ mail, just the ones where it says "the mail in xyz
has been read".

  Hmm, looks like I managed to break my sig rotation script.  Maybe I
shouldn't have switched interactive-use shell, scripting shell, and
editor at the same time.  :)

This block should never execute.  Bug!
