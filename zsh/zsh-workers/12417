You could do:

  bindkey -M menuselect '^D' redisplay

to make ^D have no (visible) effect.

You can give `select=*' more than once, which especially makes sense
if it's once with a number and once with `long*':

  zstyle '*' menu yes=long select=long select=10

(the manual says `In addition to (or instead of)...').
