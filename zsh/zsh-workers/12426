I don't think, they will consider that bug "release critical". AFAIK
"critical" and "grave" bugs are considered "release critical bugs". If I will
send a bug report and put "grave" to Severity:-field, I think I'll be flamed
by that Debian developer, that maintains Debian package of zsh.

http://www.debian.org/Bugs/Reporting

http://www.debian.org/Bugs/Developer#severities

critical 
    makes unrelated software on the system (or the whole system) break, or
causes serious data loss, or introduces a security hole on systems where you
install the package. 

grave 
    makes the package in question unuseable or mostly so, or causes data
loss, or introduces a security hole allowing access to the accounts of users
who use the package. 

important 
    any other bug which makes the package unsuitable for release. 

normal 
    the default value, for normal bugs. 

wishlist 
    for any feature request, and also for any bugs that are very difficult
to fix due to major design considerations.  

fixed 
    for bugs that are fixed but should not yet be closed. Bugs fixed by
non-maintainer-uploads have their severity set to fixed.
