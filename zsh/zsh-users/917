I don't know what's happening to stop it from inheriting the colours from 
tcsh, but within zsh you can do:

eval `dircolors -b`

since zsh understands Bourne-shell syntax.

I assume you mean in completions and things.  There is a patch for this, using 
pretty much the bits grabbed from the colour-ls, but it was felt to be too big 
to put in the core of zsh.  There were threats that it might become possible 
to add this kind of thing as a module, which would be acceptable, but I'm not 
sure that it's possible yet, and I haven't seen it done.
