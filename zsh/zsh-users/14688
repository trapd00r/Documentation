Huh, I can finally reproduce Christoph's problem.

[ I really liked my "ISO-2022-JP contained a quote" theory. :-) ]

Running under zsh -x, w/ the same set up: in a directory containing only 
A1 and A2, and a zstyle -e of the form:

zstyle -e ':completion:*' completer $'\nSOMETHING\nreply=(_files)'

After:

$ blah 本 A<Tab>

If the SOMETHING contains certain references to $CURSOR, prefix contains 
'AA' instead of 'A' (and CURSOR is advanced by one).

For various SOMETHINGs:

CURSOR=$CURSOR        # doesn't break
print -lr $CURSOR >&2 # does    break
_throwaway=$CURSOR    # does    break


I'm falling back to the usual suspect (_path_files).

Best,
Ben
