Subject: Empty .pro files causing compiler warnings
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

When compiling under AIX, I get loads of warnings complaining about a
number of the .pro files being empty. The patch below fixes this on AIX
by putting a comment in all .pro files but note no 'PATCH' in the
subject. This is because GNU make doesn't seem to cope with the
multi-line sed. Can someone who knows how to do multi-line commands in
a Makefile please fix this up properly. If that isn't possible, I'll
think up another way.

This isn't critical because as I said, they are only warnings so all
they do is detract from the real information and don't make it look very
professional.

Oliver
