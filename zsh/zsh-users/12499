I would like to remind you that on solaris syestem, where ncursesw 
installed in /usr/local and needs /usr/local/include/ncursesw/term.h 
rather than /usr/include/term.h, normal build fails, and I need to run 
"*CFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include/ncursesw ./configure*". The make 
diagnostics is

If there are no new disasters I will release this as 4.3.5 in a couple
of days.

If you get a chance to look at the documentation let me know if there is
anything obviously broken there.  I'm getting a warning about the
texinfo node "User Configuration Functions" from pdftex which doesn't
seem to make sense.
