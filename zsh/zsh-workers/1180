Furthermore, I do not see why precmd couldn't be used. Admittedly, it is run
*before* prompt, instead of after, but in case of a simple cd command, I
fail to see the difference (the title will be changed before the next
command, which is quite the same as being changed after the current one).

In case of directory title in an xterm, this is the most efficient solution.
