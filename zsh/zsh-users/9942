An overall summary is probably yes...  The $(...) construct doesn't
cause the text it outputs to be completely reevaluated, just output
onto the command line as a set of words.  This is substantially
different from what you want.

You could get the history part working better with

alias hl='eval "$(history -n -2 -2)" '

which takes the output from the history commands and treats it as a
command line (which is, of course, what it is).  The problem is
that the eval applies to the entire line, including anything you type
after "hl ".  I can think of nasty tricks involving functions to work
round that, but not any simple fix.

I presume you're trying to avoid bang-history for some reason.  If you're
not wedded to aliases you could use a zle function to retrieve specific
stuff from the history.
