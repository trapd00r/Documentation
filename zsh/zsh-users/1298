Yes, that's it isn't it.  And how can I then use this in a natural feeling 
way? i.e., even if there's a foobar in the current directory, sometimes I'll 
want to know about the foo that's somewhere in my cdpath.  I still don't feel 
I know what I want, exactly, but not sorting would be OK as a start (if I want 
foo, then I just have to know about it, and not use completion).
