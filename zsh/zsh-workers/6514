Just for the record: this function was in the first example file for
the new completion stuff and hasn't change since then. At that time I
really didn't have the time to write anything more sophisticated -- it 
is a hack.
So we probably should change this function to something better (and
faster, using compadd and only shell-code, no awk) anyway.
However, I explicitly excluded targets with slashes in them because if 
you use makedepend or something like that, you normally end up with
lots of full path names as targets -- and that for every system header 
file (a better solution would probably be to search only lines up the
makedepend marker-comment or something like that...).

Bye
 Sven
