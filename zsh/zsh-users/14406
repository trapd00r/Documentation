======================

   read -t foo || { print -n "Input required from TTY: " ; read foo }
   echo ${foo}

=================

   if { read -t foo } {
       ## do this if input was read from STDIN
       print "Input read from stdin: ${foo}"
   } else {
       ## do this if input comes from TTY
       print -n "Input required from TTY: "
       read foo
       print "Input read from TTY: ${foo}"
   }


if the input you're looking for is on a single line you shouldn't have to 
mess with zselect.
