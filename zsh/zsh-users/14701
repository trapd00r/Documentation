Hello.

May be this topic has already discussed, but I hadn't found this.

Now completion system depends on non-compiled _* files. And I think that will be better to keep them compiled.
I'd like to know developer's opinion about this.

I could try to fix this, but I don't know where to store first line comment from this files.

Moreover, I think that it will be better to compile all files in functions into functions.zwc. And do this in Makefile, and not in distributive side build scripts.
