Not quite.  -i only suppresses one type of error, that of loading an
already loaded module.  If loading is attempted and fails, it still
complains, and the zmodautoload-generated function won't unfunction
itself.  A -q option should logically suppress all error reports, but
that could indeed by done by redirecting stderr.

No.  commands with the same name but different directories are
logically distinct, and modules should be treated the same way.  It
might be useful to allow unloading of a module by base name only, but
we can get a much more powerful effect by adding a -m option (i.e. a
globbing option).
