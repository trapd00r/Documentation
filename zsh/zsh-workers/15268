Is it (easily) possible to preserve initial // irrespectively of
squeez-slashes? (Or depending on other style)? Looks like zsh is gaining
popularity on Cygwin and probably will be included in standard net release;
having the above allows you finally complete inside network shares
(fake-files //:'server1 server2' ...).

Sven?
