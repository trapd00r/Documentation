I just accidentally sent a message about an exec problem, please
ignore it. I was going to post to here asking about the problem, but
in the middle of composing my message I found that it was an OS
specific problem and I changed the text to an appropriate message to
my local sysadmin, but I forgot to change the address...

Sorry,
shr
