That's a really strange error.  It's coming from ZLE attempting to read
one byte from the tty file descriptor, which should have been correctly
opened long before that point (or else you should have seen a different
error, earlier).

Does the same error happen if you log in as someone else and then use
"su -" to start a root login shell?  Otherwise I'm out of ideas on how
to tell you to debug it.
