Pardon me if this belongs more on the developer's list, but I'm not on that.

In zsh 3.1.7-pre-1, I notice that **/ is matching directory names starting
with `.' (I have extendedglob on and globdots off, like usual).  Needless to
say, this is not what I want; 3.0.7 and 3.1.6 both do the right thing.

I just started running 3.1.7-pre-1 a few days ago, and am seeing a couple
of other peculiar things as well.  They're harder to describe, so I'll
investigate more and report those a little later.
