Hi,

re-reading the User's guide I have made many changes to my .zshrc and
I was wondering what the "pros" would say about that. So if you're
really bored and don't know what to do with your sparetime you might
have a look at http://www.thorstenkampe.de/tmp/zshrc.txt [14 kB] and
tell me what you think.

Just to make myself clear: I'm not looking for an "in-depth analysis",
just a quick "overhaul" like...

- "you're setting "foo" but also "bar" which is contradictory and
makes no sense"

- "you're not setting "foo", but everyone else does, so you might have
forgotten that"

- "line n seems pretty unclear to me. Do you really know what it's
supposed to do[1]?"


Thanks in advance,
Thorsten

[1] Don't look at the "matcher-list" zstyle. I know what the comment
says but I'm still trying to figure out what I wanted it to do when I
wrote this line two years ago :-/
