Is there an easy way to temporarily turn off the "no matches found" 
message that a failed glob returns? I'm looking mainly for something 
simple enough to use in an alias--I have an alias called "lspf" which 
is defined as "ls **/*(.)", but I'd like to make it return something 
custom if no such files exist. Redirecting stderr doesn't help, because 
(I assume) the message is generated by zsh, not ls.
