http://sources.gentoo.org/viewcvs.py/gentoo-x86/www-apps/nanoblogger/files/nb.bashcomp?rev=1.1&view=markup
If you didn't know, you can use some (all?) bash completion scripts if
you do this
autoload bashcompinit
bashcompinit
source nb.bashcomp

It looks like this one works more or less fine.

In the case of programs with gnu output you can just use
compdef _gnu_generic nb
but it doesn't handle the arguments for options like --blogdir, it's
good for stuff like rm and mv though.
