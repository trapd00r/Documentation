It's ten years too late to worry about that.  I don't see any problem.
Space for a couple of dozen lines of shell function no-one has to use isn't
going to worry anyone (so long as the defaults make it work naturally, of
course, which they do).

I can see an argument for being able to choose via a style.  Then using tag
aliases you can effectively make _expand_aliases into different
commands/completers for completing or expanding command or global aliases.

Now if you're *really* looking for overkill, there's the feature that
aliases whose text ends with a space cause expansion of subsequent words as
aliases...
