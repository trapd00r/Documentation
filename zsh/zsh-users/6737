    I remember to have read that an empty directory has just two
links in some Unix book in the past :???

    Yes, it works, my problem was not that. I process the list
file-per-file, and I thought that you couldn't use glob modifiers if
the filename didn't have any glob metachar in it ;) Now that I know
that I can do it, processing is very easy ;))

    Thanks a lot ;)
