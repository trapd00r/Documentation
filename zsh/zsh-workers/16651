Unfortunately, right now the addition of new keys isn't automated.  It's
been on my to-do for a while to automate things but, for now, it all
goes through me, or one of the other "volunter sysadmins".

I should mention that all of the maintenance of the site is done by
volunteers.  There is no professional staff other than that.
