I use dtksh for building useful little utilities like program
launchers.  It's much easier to write in dtksh than in tcl, python or perl.
If I was going to write in any of those three,  I would write in 
C instead - no more difficult,  easier to read and no learning
curve.

Dtksh scripts are very efficient - remember, most of the work is
being done in the shared library routines.  You can also
add your own builtins easily,  which I have done for some X
calls that were inexplicably left out.
