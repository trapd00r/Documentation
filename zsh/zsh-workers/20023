Another pointed out by Matthias K -- with the cursor after the "M", that 
is, inside the right curly brace:

schaefer<504> print ${M}
schaefer<504> print Makefile}
Completing corrections
Makefile     Misc/        Makefile.in  META-FAQ   
Completing original
${M

It's trying to complete a brace-expansion rather than a parameter, it 
would appear.
