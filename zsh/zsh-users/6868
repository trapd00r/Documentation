How interesting! Didn't know about that. I played a bit with it and was 
intrigued by its behavior with filenames with spaces, but then 'man zshzle' 
told me there's a copy-prev-shell-word which does the same but works with 
spaces. The manpage, however, says both are bound to the same key by default 
(a documentation bug?).
