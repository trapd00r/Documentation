Subject: Wordcode functions with empty bodies
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

This is mostly aimed at Sven ... just a reminder that the bug discussed in
11837-11841 and 11854-11859 appears to have something to do with wordcode
compiled from a function whose body is the single token NULLTOK.
