I expect ${+terminfo} to be 0, not to give an error.

Alright, let's try again to report the bug with the terminfo special
parameter and the zsh/terminfo module:

$ (unset TERM; zsh -fic 'echo $ZSH_VERSION; echo ${+terminfo}')
4.3.10
zsh:1: unknown parameter: terminfo


 $ (unset TERM; zsh -fic 'echo $ZSH_VERSION; echo ${+terminfo}')
4.3.4
0

The behavior in 4.3.4 is the expected one,
and the behavior in 4.3.10 is a regression
introduced since then.

My guess is that the zsh core is not prepared to deal
with the NULL return from getterminfo.
