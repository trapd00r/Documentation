Unfortunately not. But I guess I found the problem. The issue relates to 
this bug: http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=221191. The last 
comment fixed the issue for me.

The grotty man page says "Use the -c switch to revert to the old 
behaviour, printing a bold character c with the sequence `c BACKSPACE 
c'  and an italic character c by the sequence `_ BACKSPACE c'. "

As I don't like modifying autogenerated config files, I changed to 
GROFF_NO_SGR= man zshbuiltins | ...
...which also works fine.

Thanks to everyone (especially Bart) who helped finding a solution,
Thorsten
