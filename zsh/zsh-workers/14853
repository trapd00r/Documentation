I appreciate you considering this for a fix (if possible). 
Thank you for pointing out that it is not a bug per the
standard.  As for compatibility, I work in a lab that mixes the
use of ksh88, sh-posix, bash, and zsh.  The line that found this
incompatibility is an environment setup script, and I'll attempt
to the line to conform to the SUS.  Zsh is an awesome shell and
I appreciate all the efforts made to by you guys.
