Sorry, the change to `compinit' wasn't right (because collist may not
be loaded and then menu-select is unknown).
For now I'll just take it out -- there isn't a way to find out if a
widget is defined, is there? And we can't just look at the output of
`zmodload' because it doesn't report linked-in modules.

Also, a fix for `_path_files' slipped in which I meant to send
separately but...

Bye
