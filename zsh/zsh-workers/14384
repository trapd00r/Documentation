You haven't unset that in your .zshenv too, have you?  In that case it will
(temporarily) lose its special connection to $manpath.  This seems to be a
bug, because it happens even if $manpath is never unset.

There's a workaround (apart from the obvious one of not unsetting it in the
first place):  if you do

manpath=(${(s.:.)MANPATH})

(actually if you set $manpath to anything, but this has the side effect of
setting it to the right value) just once, they will keep track again
thereafter.

I may, or may not, get round to looking at both these bugs this weekend.
