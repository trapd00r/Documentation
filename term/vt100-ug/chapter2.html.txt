Installation, Interface Information and Specifications

Installation

Site Considerations

The design of the VT100 terminal (Figure 2-1) will normally pose few
constraints on selecting a place in which to install the terminal. In most
cases, any environment suitable to the terminal operator will be a
satisfactory environment in which to operate the terminal. Extremes of
temperature and humidity should be avoided. A summary of VT100 guaranteed
operating conditions is found at the end of this section.

Unpacking and Maintenance

The VT100 shipping carton contains the following items:

  â¢ VT100 monitor
  â¢ VT100 detached keyboard
  â¢ VT100 power cord
  â¢ VT100 SET-UP label
  â¢ VT100 User's Guide

To install the VT100 perform the following steps:

 1. Remove the VT100 from the shipping carton and place it in the desired work
    area.
 2. Place the keyboard in front of the terminal and plug the keyboard coiled
    cord into the keyboard receptacle located on the rear of the terminal (
    Figure 2-2).
 3. Verify that the power selector switch shows the correct wall outlet
    voltage (115 V is standard in the U.S.) and the power switch is off.
 4. Connect the power cord to the power cord receptacle on the rear of the
    terminal and plug the other end of the power cord into a nearby wall
    outlet.
 5. Connect the communications cable to the appropriate communications
    receptacle.
 6. Turn the power switch on. The terminal will now automatically perform the
    power-up self-test and either the ON LINE or LOCAL light located on the
    keyboard will be turned on. After approximately one minute the cursor will
    be visible in the upper-left corner of the screen. If any other indication
    is shown, refer to Part 5 of the operator information chapter.
 7. Set the desired SET-UP features as outlined in the operator's section of
    this manual.
 8. Once the installation setup procedure is complete, record the SET-UP
    features selected on the VT100 SET-UP label and attach the label to the
    underside of the keyboard.

User Maintenance

The keyboard keys are the only moving parts of the terminal and require no
preventive maintenance by the owner. The VT100 surfaces may be cleaned with
soap and water or any mild detergent. Cleaners with solvents should not be
used.

The VT100 packaging is not meant to be weatherproof; there are several
openings in the case through which liquids, coins, paper clips, and other
objects can fall. Such objects would disturb the electronic operation of the
terminal if they came into contact with the circuitry. For this reason, avoid
putting drinks and metal objects on the top of the terminal, or using
excessive water to clean the terminal. Rubbing the keys with a dry or barely
moist cloth should suffice to clean them. Do not remove the keycaps to clean
them more thoroughly; damage may result to the switch contacts if they are
replaced incorrectly.

Keep the ventilation slots clear. Blocking these slots by placing objects on
top of or under the VT100 may cause the terminal to overheat.

Interface Information

EIA Interface

The basic VT100 operates on full duplex, asynchronous communication lines. The
terminal interfaces to the line with a 25-pin connector mounted on the back of
the terminal which meets the requirements of EIA specification RS-232-C.
Table 2-1 summarizes the EIA connector signals; the following paragraphs
explain each signal as used in the basic VT100.

Protective Ground -- Pin 1
This conductor is electrically bonded to the VT100 chassis. Use of this
conductor for reference potential purposes is not allowed.

Transmitted Data (from VT100) -- Pin 2
The VT100 transmits serially encoded characters and break signals on this
circuit, which is held in the mark state when neither characters nor break
signals are being transmitted.

Received Data (to VT100) -- Pin 3
The VT100 receives serially encoded characters generated by the user's
equipment on this circuit.

Request to Send (from VT100) -- Pin 4
Asserted at all times when terminal is powered up.

Clear to Send (to VT100) -- Pin 5
Ignored at all times.

Data Set Ready (to VT100) -- Pin 6
Ignored at all times.

Signal Ground -- Pin 7
This conductor establishes the common ground reference potential for all
voltages on the interface. It is permanently connected to the VT100 chassis.

Carrier Detect (to VT100) -- Pin 8
Ignored at all times.

Speed Select (from VT100) -- Pins 11, 19, and 23
This signal is alternately called Secondary Request to Send. The basic VT100
maintains this line in the asserted state at all times.

Speed Indicator (to VT100) -- Pin 12
This signal, alternately called Secondary Carrier Detect, is ignored at all
times.

Transmission Clock (to VT100) -- Pin 15
Ignored at all times.

Receive Clock (to VT100) -- Pin 17
Ignored at all times.

Data Terminal Ready (from VT100) -- Pin 20
Data Terminal Ready is asserted at all times except under the following
conditions:

 1. Terminal is not powered up
 2. Terminal is in LOCAL mode
 3. The 3.5 second interval following the pressing of SHIFT-BREAK.

Ring Indicator (to VT100) -- Pin 22
Ignored at all times.

Electrical Characteristics

VT100 Output Voltages -- On signals designated "from VT100", the mark, or
unasserted state, is -6.0 V to -12.0 V; the space, or asserted state, is
+6.0 V to +12.0 V.

VT100 Input Voltages -- On signals designated "to VT100", -25.0 V to +0.75 V
or an open circuit is interpreted as a mark or unasserted state, and +25.0 V
to +2.25 V is interpreted as a space or asserted state. Voltages greater in
magnitude than +-25 V are not allowed. These levels are compatible with EIA
STD RS-232-C and CCITT Recommendation V.28.

Optional 20 mA Current Loop Interface

In most current loop applications, the VT100 will be connected in a passive
configuration -- that is, current is supplied to the VT100. In this mode, the
transmitter and receiver are both passive, both optically isolated, and the
transmitter goes to the mark state when power is turned off.

Conversion from active to passive (or vice versa) requires moving a slide
switch.

In active mode either the transmitter or the receiver or both may be connected
so that the VT100 sources the 20 mA of current. In active mode isolation is
not present and the transmitter will go to the space state when power to the
VT100 is turned off.

Figure 2-3 shows the 20 mA current loop interface connector mounted to the
access cover and the individual pin assignment.

Electrical Characteristics
The electrical characteristics of the 20 mA current loop interface are shown
below:

           Transmitter                        Receiver
                     Min   Max                         Min   Max
Open circuit voltage 5.0 V 50 V   Voltage drop marking --    2.5 V
Voltage drop marking --    4.0 V  Spacing current      --    3.0 mA
Spacing current      --    2.0 mA Marking current      15 mA 50 mA
Marking current      20 mA 50 mA   

In addition to the above specifications for passive operation, active mode
will place the transmitter or receiver in series with a source of 17 V +-5
percent and 660 ohms.

External Video Connections

In addition to the EIA interface, the VT100 is also capable of easily
interfacing to external video devices. The video devices may act either as a
slave to the VT100 when connected to the composite video output or provide
synchronized video to the VT100 video section when connected to the video
input. The external video connectors are the two female BNC connectors located
on the back of the terminal just below the EIA connector. The upper connector,
J8, is the video input while the lower connector, J9, is the video output.

Composite Video Output (J9)
The composite video output provides RS170-like output (see note) generated by
combining the video signal with a composite sync signal. This output contains
all video data appearing on the VT100 screen except that video which comes
from J8. The output has the following nominal characteristics. (Refer to
Figure 2-4).

 1. Output impedance = 75 ohms, dc-coupled
 2. Sync level = 0 V
 3. Black level = approximately 0.3 V when loaded with 75 ohms
 4. White level = approximately 1.0 V with a 75 ohm load
 5. The composite sync waveform conforms to EIA RS170 standards. The vertical
    interval is composed of six equalizing pulses, six vertical sync pulses,
    and six more equalizing pulses. The timing is as follows:

    Equalizing pulse width = 2.33us +- 50ns
    Vertical pulse width   = 27.28us +- 200ns
    Horizontal pulse width = 4.71us +- 50ns
    Horizontal blank width = 11.84us +- 50ns/80 column mode
                           = 12.34us +- 50ns/132 column mode
    Front porch            = 1.54us +- 50ns

NOTE: The use of dc-coupling is not in strict agreement with RS170. To agree
with RS170 the output load requires a 10uF capacitor in series with the
output. Failing to do so, the 2 mA dc short circuit current requirement is
violated. This presents no problem with most monitors which are in fact
ac-coupled.

Video Input (J8)
An analog signal applied to the video input will be "ORed" with the internal
video signal in such a way that the beam intensity at any point on the screen
will correspond to the intensity of that signal which would tend to make the
beam brighter at that point. A video signal on this input affects only the
internal screen and does not appear on the composite video output. This input
has the following nominal characteristics.

 1. Input impedance = 75 ohms, dc-coupled
 2. Black level = 0 V
 3. White level = 1.0 V
 4. Maximum continuous input = +-2.0 V

The external video source must be synchronized to the VT100; it may do this by
referencing the composite sync on the composite video output. This means that
the VT100 video input will not synchronize with any composite video source
including the composite video output of another VT100.
