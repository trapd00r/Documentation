Just tried with builtin zsh completion (zsh -f; bindkey '^X^I'
complete-word). If globcomplete is set, it completes pattern; if
globcomplete is not set, it leaves it as is. But builtin completion does not
have _path_files ...

So, I think, _path_files should leave the pattern unquoted (even for
compatibility with builtin). The question is, should it complete at all? As
my examples shows, it could be usable.
