You could if you used two copies of the source tree like I do ...

} Let's just each use our own sequence numbers, and rely on grep to tie
} the CVS changes to the mailing list message.

Our own sequence numbers?  I can't imagine anyone who's not on the mailing
list making any sense of four or five separate sets of sequence numbers.
Heck, I am on the mailing list and I wouldn't want to try to make sense
of it.  Exactly what am I going to grep, anyway?  Is each of us supposed
to be keeping our own archive of the entire mailing list?  And where does
this additional sequence number appear in the mailing list message?  How
do I get Sven's number 22396 and not Peter's?

And what about people who don't have commit access who mail patches to
the list?

If we're going to drop the article numbers from the ChangeLog because
it's too much work to keep them, then just drop them.  Bolting on some
multithreaded numbering scheme is only going to make things worse.
