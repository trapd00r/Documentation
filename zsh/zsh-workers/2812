There are cases when zsh is not able to see correctly whether an
expression is a `((...))' let-substitute, or embedded subshells.  Here
is a message describing it from gnu.bash.bug, which well applies to
zsh.  I think the case mentioned is quite reasonable, and that a
change should be thought of.

What do you think?

I've seen several bug reports on this problem, and I think it would be
worth implementing a change in the grammar:

`((' should only be considered an expression if it were matched by a
`))'.  If a single `)' were found, then whatever is between the parens
would be considered a command list.

Does anyone know how hard it would be to implement this?
