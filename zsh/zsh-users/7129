Hi,

is it possible to test for a compiled script (.zwc) whether the script
or the complied version ist executed?

I made a script with "echo 111" inside and compiled it with "zcompile
test.zsh". After that I modified the  script to "echo 222" and
executed "touch test.zsh.zwc" to fool zsh in believing that the old
"test.zsh.zwc" is the newer one of both.

But unfortunately "./test.zsh" displayed "222" (the value of the
script) and not "111" (the value of the compiled script).

Anyone hints?

Thorsten
