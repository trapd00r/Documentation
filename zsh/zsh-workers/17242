This is fun, but there seems to be a buglet when I use menu selection
with

  zstyle ':completion:*' format 'Completing %d'

and hit `return' to accept the completion; I get a display looking like

  % echo builds/pws_bc02/stack_unsigned.lst

  stack_unsigned.lst
  stack_unsigned.lst

where the blank line was where the `interactive' prompt appeared, the
upper filename where `Completing file' appeared, and the lower
of the two filenames is still highlighted.
