Not only that, even outside of functions, some expressions such as

    variable+=$value

will not always behave as intended if the variable is not typeset.  If
it is typeset as an array for example, you can depend on it appending
"$value" to the list.  Otherwise it might try to add it as an integer
or append it as a string, depending on it's value.
