But see how PS4 is expanded for every command:
$ zsh -o PROMPT_SUBST -c 'PS4="\$(od -vAn -N2 -x /dev/urandom) "
                          set -x; : a | : b; : c && : d'
 4542 : a
 e866 : b
 a7ad : c
 6051 : d

BTW, shouldn't PROMPT_SUBST be enabled by default in sh and ksh
emulation?

Is there a way to run shell code (other than assignments and
arithmetic expansion) upon the expansion of PS4? I thought of
/(e:code:), but in scalar context I couldn't find a way for
globbing to be performed.
