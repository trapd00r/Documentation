Because this is established standard to define your character set=20
properties. Without it applications should assume C (or POSIX) locale=20
that basically corresponds to standard ASCII. So I would be surprised if=20
zsh were the only program that had issues with non-ASCII characters.

=46reeBSD could provide some other means to define local though.

Because blindly emitting arbitrary character sequence to terminal may=20
have completely undefined effects and screw up display to the point that=20
you need hard reset (town legend also is that you can cause you terminal=20
to echo back any sequence like "rm -rf" as input back to shell ...)
