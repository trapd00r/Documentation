Fix is below.  You may not like this fix:

% echo foo !:^-bar
zsh: no such word in event

Some explanation.  When !:^-bar is expanded, there is still only `echo foo'
stored in the history. ^- selects everything from the first argument except
the last one, which means 1-0 range in this case, which is invalid.  And
the new behaviour is tcsh compatible.  Before this patch zsh corrupted
memory on all !:a-b substitution when `b' was less than `a'.  The real fix
is the first hunk, the second hunk is just a cosmetic optimisation change.
