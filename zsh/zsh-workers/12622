That's the problem. Currently, on systems that need external shared library,
even "built-in" modules will be compiled into this library and not into the
main executable.

So, I think, it makes more sense if it will be added as additional dependency
to main zsh.exe. This can happily live in Makefile; just dependency will be
added under Cygwin.
