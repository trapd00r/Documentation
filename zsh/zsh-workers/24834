AFAIK, it's the only way to prevent some corruption due to file caching.

But procmail *also* uses fcntl. My patch still uses the old lock
mechanism, it just adds fcntl locking. That said, I often use fcntl
only, without any problem.

Some software, like Firefox, uses symlink() locking. So, if symlink()
isn't atomic, there will be problems with such software.

I don't see why it can be dangerous if it is used in addition to
another lock mechanism, like it currently is.
