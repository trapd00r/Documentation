Just upgraded to zsh-3.0.2 final and I get a segmentation fault when
running lynx with "-post_data" switch which makes it expect some data
from the tty's standard input. 

I use this command every day and it worked fine with bash and all zsh
versions before 3.0.2. Even 3.0.2-test3 was OK I think. Here is the
output:

retriever:~% lynx -post_data https://www.datek.com/cgi-bin/vfpwebn.exe
some data typed to lynx's sdtin and then I do <CR> and <CTRL-D>
zsh: segmentation fault  lynx -post_data https://www.datek.com/cgi-bin/vfpwebn.exe
retriever:~%     

My system is Linux 2.0.27, libc 5.4.13.

Sorry I can't be more helpful, I'm only a newbie...
