Compiling on MacOS now ... snippet of config.log:

However, it didn't build the attr module.  Still didn't build it after
a "make clean".  Missing dependency?  Trying again from "make distclean":
OK, compiled the attr module that time.

} If it compiles but doesn't work,
} I will need someone else to research the problem.

I tried this:

% zmodload zsh/attr
% for x in /*; print -R $x $'\t= ' $(zlistattr $x)
/Applications   = 
/Desktop DB     = com.apple.FinderInfo
/Desktop DF     = com.apple.FinderInfo
/Developer      = com.apple.FinderInfo
/Library        = 
/Network        = com.apple.FinderInfo
/System         = 
/User Guides And Information    = com.apple.FinderInfo
/Users  = 
/Volumes        = com.apple.FinderInfo
/bin    = com.apple.FinderInfo
/cores  = com.apple.FinderInfo
/dev    = 
/etc    = 
/home   = 
/mach.sym       = com.apple.FinderInfo
/mach_kernel    = com.apple.FinderInfo
/mach_kernel.ctfsys     = com.apple.FinderInfo
/net    = 
/opt    = 
/private        = com.apple.FinderInfo
/sbin   = com.apple.FinderInfo
/tmp    = 
/usr    = com.apple.FinderInfo
/var    = com.apple.FinderInfo

Is there more that should be tested?
 
} ... patches are useful even if incomplete (and preferred to text
} statements along the lines of "wouldn't it be better to change ...").

Pardon for my tendency to do that lately.  My inclination is to avoid
sending a patch unless I actually intend for someone to apply it, so
if I'm not certain about a change ...
