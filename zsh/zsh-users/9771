I've put a test release of zsh 4.3 in the pub/development directory of
ftp.zsh.org.  It's unlikely to differ much from 4.3.1 when that appears.

The main new feature compared with 4.2 is multibyte support.  This is
only enabled by default on some machines (most recent PC Unix-like
targets in particular).  Reports on other machines where it works (or
compiles but doesn't work) when you explicitly supply --enable-multibyte
to configure would be useful.

The documentation package for 4.3 contains a PDF file instead of a
PostScript file.  This should be easier to browse.
