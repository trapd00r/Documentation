Not really. I could be fine with that (though other shells
behave differently) as leaving a variable unquoted in list
context (as in arguments to a command above) is known not to be
reliable anyway.

My concern was more in non-list contexts.

In

emulate sh
var='\\'
newvar=$var

I expect newvar to be the exact copy of var.
