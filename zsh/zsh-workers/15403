        That should be the same thing.  I haven't touched that in a
long, long while (since 3.1.6 days), so I have no idea if it'll
cooperate with 4.0.2.


        And I like Oliver's sugguestion about an infrastructure for
building modules outside the zsh tree propper.  If there was a
framework along the same lines as perl's ExtUtils::MakeMaker module or
apache's apxs utility, then it'd be more feasable to setup a CZAN (a
la CPAN or CTAN) with seperately downloadable modules (my zperl, the
pcre module that was submitted, et al).
