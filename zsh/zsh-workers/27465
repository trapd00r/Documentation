Um, I've seen that the "set-option -w" patch was committed, but the
capture-pane support from zsh-workers-27450 seems have fallen through
the cracks (or maybe, I'm just a little too impatient).

That would be this patch:
    <http://www.zsh.org/mla/workers/2009/msg01236.html>

Seems like it still applies cleanly even on top of the set-option
patch.

Regards, Frank
