} I think that a temporary _ugly_ fix is to bind the keys for some exact
} cases(5 or 6 arguments). This will "fix" their request... but I repeat it's
} ugly.

Be very careful not to introduce a loop.  You can't, for example, do

	bindkey -s '\e1\e.' '\e-\e1\e.'

as the ESC 1 ESC . in the expansion will again match the key binding and
repeat the expansion.

} Something strange happens here.
} If I type \Cv \C\My I only get the ESC character('^[')

Are you doing (hold down Ctrl, hold down Alt, tap Y) or are you doing
(tap ESC, hold down Ctrl, tap Y)?  The binding I gave was for the first
of those, and does not also cause the second one to be bound.  You need
to also do

	bindkey '\e\Cy' insert-last-word

to get the ESC prefix to work.
