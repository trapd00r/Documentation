i wrote it before but no reply.
it seems i am the only one who misses the ability to 
call macros like one normally does in vi with @.

again:

such macros begin with _ and a letter.
they are aliases that start like this:
alias _a='ithis is a test^[hhh'

now, if i do a @a the following would happen.

the shell would change to input-mode in the bindkey -v mode.
would right "this is a test to the shell" (absolute nonsense, of course!)
and then change to command-mode and step back 3 letters.

that is one command that is useful and i think, it has been forgotten.
 (most people use the emacs-mode)

the other thing that is really useful and is implemented in the
bash (i think, ksh and pdksh, too)
is 
control-x (

this starts a macro in emacs-mode.
this macro is stopped with control-x ) and executed with control-x e.

this is missing , too.

the zsh should have it!


besides the zsh is still a killer shell of course!
