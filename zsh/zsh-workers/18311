They're identical?  Or is it just that the .so entries in zshall.1
aren't expanding on your system for some reason?  This can happen if
your system gzips manpages; the FreeBSD port works around this by
running soelim on zshall.1 in the extracted source tree, and installing
the resulting output as zshall.1.gz.
