	from scanning the manpages, it looks like setopt nomailwarning
might be what you are looking for; it might be the exact opposite,
however, since it isn't clear from the docs of the warning message
is the one specified by mailpath (in which case it would turn off
the "you have new mail") or the "the mail in ___ has been read"
message.
	another thing to try might be to unset mailpath entirely
in your .zshrc, and then use a precmd to do the check for you--it's
kind of kludgy, but i've done similar things for checking on the
status of certain important hosts, and it seems to work fine.
