I don't, yet, I'm using 3.0.  I'll have to look for it...

(And then work out how to program modules - sounds fun...)

Er, on 3.0 it seems that the mark is initially set to the start of the line,
so if I do:

  $bind^X^X

then the cursor goes to the start of the line.  Not exactly useful.
Otherwise it looks like the sort of thing I wanted...

Definitely not to me.  Although having it as Yet Another Option(tm) is
probably a good thing for those who do want it.  Perhaps a request to put
the tcsh behaviour in as another option?

Thanks,
