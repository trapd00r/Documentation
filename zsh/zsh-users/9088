Let me guess:

alias run-help=man
alias which-command=whence

I suspect you're not using reporter correctly.  Those are the two built-
in aliases.

You can't run "reporter" as a shell script. (Well, you can, but it won't
give the correct results; it'll tell you what's in your /etc/zshenv, and
not much else.)  It has to be either read into the current shell with
the "." or "source" commands, or autoloaded and then run as a shell
function.

E.g.

    source reporter aliases
