Notice that he said ksh93.  I think Solaris uses ksh89.

Also, I will probably add this since I think == is a more logical way
of representing this.  But I must stress something important:

The goal of zsh is not to be a ksh clone.  The goal of zsh (as far as I'm
concerned) is to be a powerful superset of sh that is especially good at
interactive use.  The ksh compatibility we have now is more a matter of
convenience than the result of explicitly trying to copy ksh.  Maintaining
ksh compatibility for common commands is a good idea, but I see no compelling
reason to copy every last detail of ksh.
