} describe-key-briefly did not report all the key sequence.

Hmm, this is a bit of a thorny problem:  describe-key-briefly only works
correctly for keys which are bound to something.  For keys that are not
bound, the search through the key tables stops as soon as it finds that
the prefix is not bound, without consuming the remaining characters of
the multi-key sequence.

Of course zsh has no way of knowing that it should treat \e[1~ as all one=

sequence before it is bound to something; it can't tell how many keys you=

pressed to cause that to appear.
