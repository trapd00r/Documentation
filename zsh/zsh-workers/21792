    I knew about the mailinglist nesting, but since I didn't see them
archived in zsh-workers, I assumed they didn't arrive on the list :(

    Here I blindly assumed that an one-day lag was too much to be
just normal delay, so I thought that crossposting was not allowed, or
maybe forwarding was disabled or something like that.

    Really, sorry for the noise O:( Obviously I didn't mean to flood
the list with my messages.
