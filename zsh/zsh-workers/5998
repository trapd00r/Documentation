Subject: no '/' after ~username in zsh-3.1.5-pws-14

Ok, I've upgraded to zsh-3.1.5-pws.14, and have noticed one problem
that I can't seem to find anything in the man pages about...the
examples there all say I should be seeing what I'm used to.  Based
on that, I'm guessing that this might be a bug.  Then again, I've
been wrong on such guesses before.  :-)

Specifically, if I type the following in the old Zsh here (3.0-pre6):

   $ cd ~g<TAB>

I end up with:

   $ cd ~graham/

Or more to the point, if (in 3.0-pre6) I type

   $ cd ~g<TAB>src/zs<TAB>

I end up with:

   $ cd ~graham/src/zsh-3.1.5-pws.14

Unfortunately, right now the '/' is missing after ~username, and I
end up with

   $ cd ~grahamsrc/zsh-3.1.5-pws.14

This, naturally, doesn't work.  :-(

How can I get the old behavior back?  If the answer is RTFM, please
let me know which FM, and roughly what I'm looking for...because if
it's there, I've missed it.

Thanks,
   --jim
