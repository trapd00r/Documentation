Yes.

Oof.  If you're going to make it usable, then REALLY make it usable.
At the risk of further abusing the already over-used parentheses, how
about (o(ug=w,o+r)) for "user and group must have exactly the write
bit set, and other must have at least r" and (o(u+x,go-w)) for "user
must have at least the execute bit set, and group and other must not
have write" and so on.

While I'm on the subject, why do we still have to use *numeric* group
and user IDs for the u and g qualifiers?  Useless for portable scripts,
except possibly for (u0).

(I know, I know, it's slow and unpleasant to do passwd and groups file
lookups, and it's undefined what to do for names that don't exist.
Grumble.)
