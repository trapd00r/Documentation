} This fact should probably be construed as a genuine feature.  If you're

} from $1 to $infinity and break it, I can't answer that, but it won't be me.

Actually, Peter, you're already too late.  That had better be

	fn() {
	  setopt functionargzero
	  0=foo
	  echo $0
	}

Otherwise, assigning to 0 in the function assigns to the "global" $0.
