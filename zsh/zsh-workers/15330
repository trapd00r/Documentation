After playing with this for a few minutes I have the following observations:

In xtrace output the `eval' itself gets a line number before the commands
that it executes are numbered, so that's fine -- it's possible to track
the eval to a line in the calling function/file.

However, neither the value of %N nor that of %_ in PS4 changes to indicate
that you've entered a new line numbering scope; only %i changes.  For a
large `eval' that can be quite distracting.
