Regarding breaking links -- there is another option to texi2html, 
--use-nodes, which will create redirects from all the node names to the 
chapter pages.  I'm not sure if this will make things worse or better.  
We could also generate redirects with the old-style names, with pretty 
little trouble, I think.  But Peter is right, the old names weren't 
exactly persistent, either.

That would be very appreciated (by me, if no one else. ;-) )  If you 
can find an email for the sourceforge people, that would be great too.
