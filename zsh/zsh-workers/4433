Re GPL: oops!  Sorry.
Re cleanliness: yes, and I can see why you drew that from what I typed,
but when I use the term 'rip' I don't mean cut&paste... just algorithm
duplication and maybe noting postability issues affecting
implementation.

As re private conversation with Zefram: an option to zsh-mv to restrict
it to a rename, but defaulting to a compatible posix-mv is perhaps more
appropriate.

Thanks for reading this far.  :^)
