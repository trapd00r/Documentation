Subject: What was the reason for history -D not reporting runtimes?
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1; format=flowed
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Content-Disposition: inline
X-Google-Sender-Auth: 85fca2cb4598aefd

I have a vague memory of asking this question earlier, but I couldn't
find it in any of the archives and not in my own mail-archive either,
so here it goes (again, probably):

Why does history -D not report times correctly, only giving 0:00?

It has something to do with some setting that interferes with the
recording of this information, but I don't remember precisely which
setting it was.

Thanks.
