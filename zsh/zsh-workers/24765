I see. "follow" is probably the worst possible word to use for this
given for example this entry in the man page for "cp"
       -L, --dereference
              always follow symbolic links in SOURCE
I would suggest changing to "symbolic links are not resolved
regardless" or even "symbolic links are not followed regardless" :).
