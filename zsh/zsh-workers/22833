Subject: Is it worth renaming Mandrake -> Mandriva?

Mandriva RPM includes patch to rename Mandrake -> Mandriva completion function 
directories (in line with general policy that word Mandrake should not appear 
anymore). I am not sure if this worth it in generic sources; and anyway I am 
not sure how to do it properly in CVS.

Apropos CVS: SF offers subversion now, does not it? What people think about 
migrating to it?
