Right.

I just installed the previous version of autoconf, 2.13, and lo and behold:
both the m4 undefine and the config.status problem aren't there. So this looks
like some weird interaction between autoconf-2.50 and m4, no?

Off to building zsh with Purify... Has anybody done this before? Is it really
useful? Any tips?

Thanks,
