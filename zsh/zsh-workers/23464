Hi,

Something happened to ftp.zsh.org. I have been using mirror-2.9 to
mirror that site into ftp://www.math.technion.ac.il/pub/zsh. However, in
the last few days, mirror tries to unlink the subdirectories old and
development. It seems that the ftp command 'ls -lRta' stopped to have a
recursive output. Please help.

Zvi.
