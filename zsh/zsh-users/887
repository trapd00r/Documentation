That's the documented behaviour, and that's how csh works (tcsh at least).
The manual says: `do not report an error unless all the patterns in a
command have no matches'.  The above command has only one pattern, /blah*
and it has no matches, so the error comes.  /tmp is not a pattern since it
does not conain any glob special characters.
