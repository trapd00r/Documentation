Well, new style completion with the usual call to `compinit' (after
autoloading and things), and then just make `nslookup' autoloaded and
call it. For my version of `nslookup' here, it works, but as Bart
mentioned in 2668, it doesn't work everywhere (and I don't feel like
spending more time trying to improve the beast, it was mainly a hack
to show how the `compcontext' parameter can be used).
