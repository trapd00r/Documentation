That's sort of what I like to do to.  I export ZDOTDIR in my user
shell, and use this function for su: 
function su {
  command su ${*:--c zsh}
}

It gives my a nice root shell when I su, without annoying the rest
of wheel with the extra uid 0 account.  It may not suit your needs
depending on how paranoid you are with your regular zsh configuration,
and how paranoid you want to be as root ;-)
