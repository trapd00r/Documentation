} The completion system definitely should not use ALL_EXPORT.

I almost added NO_kshglob to _comp_opts as well, because _main_complete
won't even autoload with kshglob in effect.  However, various sorts of
file completion/expansion would then of course not behave as the kshglob
user expects.  Any suggestions on the right way to handle this?
