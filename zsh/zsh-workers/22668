Subject: Honor the dvorak option in tetris (patch)
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8; format=flowed
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Content-Disposition: inline

Here is a small patch to honor the dvorak option in tetris, not sure
if there is a better way to check options from scripts than
setopt|grep name?
