HASH_LIST_ALL means that the path is fully hashed *the first time* you
do completion, for efficiency.  For the same efficiency reasons, it
isn't rehashed automatically thereafter, which is the effect you are
seeing.

What you might want is always to complete commands by searching rather
than by the hash table.  I don't think that's currently supported.
(The implementation detail is that we use the zsh/parameter module's
special associative array commands to access the internal hash table.)

Actually, it would be trivial to make the shell issue a rehash on each
command search and nowadays (unlike the days when hashing of commands
was really useful) it doesn't take that long, at least unless you have
an NFS disk on a dial-up line from Ulaanbaatar.  This could be a style...
  zstyle ":completion:*" rehash true
will turn it on.
