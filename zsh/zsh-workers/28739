Let's try this again, shall we? Apparently, it's harder to use an email
client than it looks. Also, as Mikael informs me on IRC, I screwed up
the patch in the first mail... *sigh*

...now that CVS is back...

Here's a fix for an issue with vcs_info's subversion detection, which
was reported in the debian BTS (issue #611175=C2=B9).

The fix was suggested by Lennart Weller.

=C2=B9 <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=3D3D611175>

Regards, Frank
