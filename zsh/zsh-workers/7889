Some of the FAQ seems to be out of date.

     \!*:x         $=*             ($*:x doesn't work (yet))

They do work now, don't they?  Also:

 sect(What's the latest version?)
 
-  Zsh 3.0.5 is the latest production version, however a test version of
-  3.0.6 is doing the rounds and should be released soon. The new major
-  number 3.0 largely reflects the considerable internal changes in zsh to
-  make it more reliable, consistent and (where possible) compatible.  Those
-  planning on upgrading their zsh installation should take a look at the
-  list of incompatibilities at the end of link(5.1)(51).  This is longer
-  than usual due to enhanced sh, ksh and POSIX compatibility.
