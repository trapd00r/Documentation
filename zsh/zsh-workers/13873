No.  Chmouel smuggled in a new _apm into the Linux directory.  Under
the new regime, where should we place it?  Debian?  Unix?  (Currently
there is no Linux directory anymore -- or wouldn't if there weren't
that _apm file in it.  Should we keep it alive and add a Command
sub-directory to it?)

Obviously apm doesn't tell me anything...

Bye
 Sven
