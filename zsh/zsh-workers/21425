Bodface is the only thing you'll ever get in a default, since you have
no way of even predicting whether a user will be using a black-on-white
xterm or a white-on-black console.  I like "(%n@%m) %B%/>%(#/#/)%b".

I'm not sure how zsh could do this in a way that an external program
(bsdtar, for example) couldn't do just as well, also allowing non-zsh
users to use the same command if they wished.

Are you referring to http://zsh.sunsite.dk/Guide/ ?  It's probably just
waiting for someone to finish it.
