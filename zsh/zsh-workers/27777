If we can find something that fits that would be great.  I think the
problem might be finding a suitable project that doesn't frighten off
someone unfamiliar with the code.  So things like making completion or
variable handling neater are probably out.

Internationalization is one area that could do with some work.  We've
discussed this in the past:  there are two parts, the main shell, which
is relatively straightforward, and functions, where there's some
significant design work.  I think my last proposal is in
