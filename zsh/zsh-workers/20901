} Here's a way to simulate adding the \n only when necessary:

}     function precmd {
}         echo -n ${(l:$COLUMNS:::)}
}     }
} 
} This prints $COLUMNS spaces.

The only trouble with this is that it's really annoying when doing
cut-and-paste, because triple-click to select the whole line will
select all those trailing spaces as well.

See also  http://www.zsh.org/mla/workers/2004/msg01117.html  or
http://www.zsh.org/cgi-bin/mla/redirect?WORKERNUMBER=20472
(the latter gets an internal server error as of this writing, but
is otherwise theoretically more stable than the former).
