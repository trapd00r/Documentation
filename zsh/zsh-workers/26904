} I believe the following is the correct fix.  I tried some more specific
} things with -r instead of -q but they seemed unsatisfactory.

Hmm, on the other hand, I just noticed that

% scp file lth:<space>

becomes

% scp file lth <cursor>

So arguably on a whitespace character the colon should be left there.
Maybe '-r:' really would be better than '-q'.  (The -q is correct in
the case with the '=' suffix, though, I'm pretty sure.)

Any thoughts?
