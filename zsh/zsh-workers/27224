Sometimes you have sets of directories with cryptic names, for example
named after bug records, in which you keep information to do with
it---anything vaguely database-related gives you this sort of
arrangement, in fact.  Rather than seeing completion lists like

BUG0001  BUG0002  BUG0003 BUG0004

you now create a one-line file (say .zshinfo) in each directory
describing the directory.  Then you can get completion lists looking
like

BUG0001  # Light switch failed to illuminate room
BUG0002  # Light bulb in south east corner of room broken
BUG0003  # Wiring behind light switch worn
BUG0004  # Loose screw on diffusor in south west corner of room

so when changing directory you no longer have to remember a set of
4-digit numbers.

The main problem at the moment is that while it's fine when every
completion is in that form, it's quite confusing if there are a mixture
of types.
