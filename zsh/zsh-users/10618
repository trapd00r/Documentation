Subject: How to insert completions on command line
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8; format=flowed
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Content-Disposition: inline

Hello,
(How do I|Is there a way to) insert all completions in the command
line? In case that sounds like i'm confused, which i am, this is what
i mean:
% cvs remove <tab>
file1.c
anotherfile.c
hello.c

and i want to get cvs remove file1.c anotherfile.c hello.c without
pressing tab and space about 8 times. I've tried all commands/keybinds
i can come up with but no luck so far.
