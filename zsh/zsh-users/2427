Yes, I am running Linux on a PC (sorry, forgot to include that
important info in my initial post!).  I'm running Debian "Slink" 2.1,
if that makes a difference.

Also, I just did a 'make menuconfig' on the linux-2.2.10 kernel, and
everything went okay.

I suppose I'll just wait for zsh-3.1.16.

Thanks!
Matt
