Why should we remove some levels? O.K., if somebody compiles
with --disable-function-subdirs - then there is no trace of original
hierarchy anyway. But I'd like to preserve it by the installation. It
gives more clear picture; it provides for easy update; it may also
provide for system-dependent initialisation (enable only selected
subdirs relevant for my system). I think, we should preserve full
existing hierarchy by the installation. Perl has potentially much deeper
structure without any harm.
