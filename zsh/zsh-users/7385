    Not at all. I have a gift to choose bad names O:))

    You're right. A better name should be added.

    Don't remember right now, I saw a couple. But before that, a
proper name and description (and rationale) for the category must be
chosen.

    I don't have your original mail at hand, but I was referring to
options like 'errexit'. I'm afraid I cannot explain better what I
have in mind, specially in English O:)

    Nice ;))
