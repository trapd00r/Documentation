As far as I can tell, it's impossible.

Redirections are done *before* the command execution is attempted,
which is why this ...

}     $ ./command 2> /dev/null

... succeeds in suppressing the error message.  But that also means
that this ...

}     $ { ./command 2>&1 } 2> /dev/null

... does *not* succeed in suppressing the error, it only succeeds in
sending the error to stdout.

}     The only solution I've found so far is to pipe stderr thru a sed
} script and get rid of any shell message

I'd have suggested 'grep -v "^zsh:"', or egrep with a more specific
set of messages to suppress.
