"disable r" will work for running an external command called "r" from
the command line.

I don't understand what's happening with "env".  As far as I understand
it, env searches the path for its command doesn't use a shell.  I get

/usr/bin/env: r: No such file or directory

which is what I'd expect since I don't have the external command.
