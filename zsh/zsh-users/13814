I'd like to be able to specify that I want no_nomatch behavior for certain 
meta-characters. With Windows commands, a common flag is '/?' (usually the 
semantic equivalent of '--help'), and I'm getting sick of typing '/\?':

$ runas /?
zsh: no matches found: /?

The other place this comes up is when pasting URLs into the terminal (both 
Windows/non):

$ wget http://example.com/probably?param=eters
zsh: no matches found: http://example.com/probably?param=eters

It'd be nice to selectively disable globbing in either of the following 
ways:

1. by choosing which metachars should not trigger NOMATCH
e.g. '?' and '[]' are common ones that trip me up only in Zsh.

2. by choosing prefixes that should trigger NO_NOMATCH
e.g. '/' or 'http://' for the above examples. Probably others. '-' on 
non-Windows.

Is there a way to do either of those? Or can someone suggest another 
workaround?

Best,
Ben
