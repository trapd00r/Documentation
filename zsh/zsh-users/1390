I guess I just need to know where to look to find out how to use a history
file instead of the way it seems to be stored in memory normally.

Also, I like to be able to ESC /blah to find prev commands with "blah" in
them, and "n" to cycle though them.  vi style hist editing rules.  How do
I accomplish this?

Shawn
