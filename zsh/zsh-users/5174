    i think jason's meant to cc the list.

    so it's not out of the box, after all. :)

    ah, this is the culprit.

    they do for ./configure options, makefile targets and whatnot, but
    not for zsh(1) switches. or does it work for you?

> Maybe see what patches were added to zsh in the ports tree?

    well, i don't see anything relevant in /usr/ports/shells/zsh, but
    i'm also pretty sure this port revision is newer than the one i
    installed from. so it *might* have changed. but i don't think that's
    the case.
