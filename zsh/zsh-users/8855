} 
} Actually, it *doesn't* fail after the patch:

I know which-command doesn't fail.  What about run-help?

} % which-command LL
} ls -lL
} 
} I would have said that's more useful, because it's clearer

No disagreement there.  I'm worried about shared code between two
widgets that (maybe) should have different behavior.
