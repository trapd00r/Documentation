Not completely, at least if you have an xterm, but it's a bit hit and
miss even there.  You can enable 8 bit mode (which you need for the -m
flag of bindkey), then type ^V, then some key with the meta key
pressed down.  For example, small e with an acute accent is \C-v\M-i
(in Emacs language), and holding down shift at the same time has the
obvious effect.
