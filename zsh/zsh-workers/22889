Subject: OT: gmail filtering this list?
To: zsh-workers@sunsite.dk
Message-id: <061020093855.ZM14309@torch.brasslantern.com>
MIME-version: 1.0
X-Mailer: OpenZMail Classic (0.9.2 24April2005)
Content-type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

All of my zsh-workers and zsh-users mail since Oct 17th has gone into the
gmail spam folder.  (I POP mail down to brasslantern.com from gmail.)
This message is both a test to see if marking them "not spam" has fixed
the filtering problem, and a warning that I may not see zsh mail in a
timely fashion if the filtering persists.
