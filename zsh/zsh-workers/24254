There's another (smaller) problem with complist.

mutt -f '+<Tab><Tab>

the closing ' is not inserted.

Another problem is for subdirs that don't work:

mutt -f +Misc/zs<Tab>

doesn't work.

To reproduce it:

mkdir -p ~/Mail/{foo,bar}/baz
mutt -f \=<Tab>

You don't need to have mutt installed.

Cheers,
Stephane
