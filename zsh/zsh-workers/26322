I think that's more likely to be a source of confusion rather than a
help.  If you know about the problem you can already get round it.  If
you don't the option isn't going to help.  The option's yet another
headache for debugging.

Further, I don't think the option would be useful without syntax to
restore the current behaviour for each variable (the opposite of
double-quoting), since as Bart pointed out that's quite widely used.
That adds yet another of layer of complexity and source of bugs.
