    Unfortunately the original data is not in an array :( Will this
work?:

    olddata=(${(f)olddata))
    olddata=(${olddata:#...})

    I completely forgot about the ${NAME:#PATTERN}. Better said, I
was stuck with ${..//..}. Thanks a lot for the suggestion. You've
given me another idea... I can convert all parameters that store file
contents into arrays, although some of them have \C-M as newline
markers, but that's easy to solve. This way I can do per-line
processing without the need for loops.
