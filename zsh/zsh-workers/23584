Hi!

Works fine now.  These issues have been addressed, yes.  Commands are
broken up into different groups, so you can easily configure what gets
shown.

One way of making sure that commands that we currently don't know
about gets included is to merge the output of $(git help -a) with the
list of commands we have descriptions for.  That way you don't have to
choose.  Also, you can avoid the description if you don't want the
long list:

  zstyle ':completion::complete:git:*' verbose no

or something like that.
