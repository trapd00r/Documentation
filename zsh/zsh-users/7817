I'm writing to solicit tips in order to get Emacs' shell mode working as
best possible with Zsh.  Right now, my .zshrc includes:
[[ $EMACS = t ]] && unsetopt zle

I'm a zsh newbie, so I'm not positive what all this disables.  In Emacs
shell mode, paths no longer complete when I press TAB like they did when I
used Bash.  Is there a way for this to work?
Any suggestions regarding emacs shell mode are appreciated.  Thanks.

Jeremy
