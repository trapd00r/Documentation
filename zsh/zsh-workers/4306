Looks like your /usr/include/sys/resource.h doesn't have the actual
RLIMIT_* definitions.  The may be in one of the other included files.
Could you grep for them and send the appropriate file (and we need
its name, too)?  They should look something like

#define RLIMIT_CPU      0               /* cpu time in milliseconds */

and so on.  If they can't be found we're in trouble.
