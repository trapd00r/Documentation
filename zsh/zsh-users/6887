I've done some more experimenting and reading, and now I think I
understand what to look for in the zstyle listing.

However, as you can see from my previous post, I have no more specific
zstyle set for the :zle: commands.

In fact, this really looks like a bug to me, since all other word
commands like:

forward-word-match, backward-word-match
backward-kill-word-match
transpose-words-match, capitalize-word-match
up-case-word-match, down-case-word-match

work as expected. For now, I have turned the lines

autoload -U select-word-style
select-word-style bash

off, and use the old bash-backward-kill-word and bash-backward-word until
this has been resolved.
