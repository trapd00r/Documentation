} OK, this one's fairly straightforward: starttrapscope() and
} endtrapscope() don't run inside traps.

This works much better now, though there's still this extra newline
being printed just before INNER on each alternate interrupt:

-----
schaefer<501> TRAPINT() { setopt localoptions localtraps; echo OUTER; \
trap 'echo INNER' INT; sleep 2 }
schaefer<502> OUTER

INNER

Plus the prompt not reprinted until accept-line or send-break, but that
probably isn't a bug.

} Are we reasonably confident the other problems are specific to the
} NetBSD style of signal handling?

I'm not confident of that, no.  Let's wait and see what Vincent has to
say after this patch is applied.
