It's not really an error.  It's NeXT's make being overly bitchy
about something that's not a problem.   The lines

.SUFFIX

are just clearing the default suffix list for that Makefile.
I added those since certain makes (particularly GNU make) are overly
aggressive about firing off default rules.

Don't worry about it.  It doesn't hurt anything.
