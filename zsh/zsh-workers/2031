Well, I appreciate the comment, but it's hardly a solution to the problem,
since some of us can't go upgrading our OSes willy-nilly, and besides that,
zsh used to compile just fine before before the pre-3.0 releases.

Solaris 2.3 isn't *that* bad - we've got production systems using it quite
happily, and as much as i'd like to see them on 2.5.1, it hasn't made it into
our development schedules just yet.

(oh, and yes, i do have a few 2.5 and 2.5.1 machines, but i haven't tried
building zsh on them yet...)

Andrew.
