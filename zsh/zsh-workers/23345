Having looked further, I see that's the effect of what you've done (with
other stuff)... however, (unless I missed something in one of the
subsequent patches) the documentation for =~ still claims it's (always)
based on pcre.

There's no harm in the regular expression stuff being a separate module,
but if it's going to be it might as well be loadable if and only
if configure detects the POSIX regexp stuff.  That's easy---I can
patch that later.
