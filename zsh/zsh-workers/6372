} As a faithful zsh user, I of course set myself up on Mac OS X Server
} with zsh, but found that my preferred options weren't sticking.
} Specifically, autolist (aka AUTO_LIST) doesn't show up in a plain
} "setopt", and it's not the default.  I compiled my own copy of zsh
} 3.1.5 and the same thing happened.

Autolist -is- on by default in 3.1.5, so it won't show up in setopt
output.  Try doing "setopt kshoptionprint" so that you can see the
state of every option; in 3.1.5 I see (among lots of others)

noautolist            off

("no... off" is "on").

} Is this a zsh problem or a MOSXS problem?

It's a zsh 3.1.5 "problem":  A whole lot of options that weren't on by
default in 3.0.x got made on-by-default in 3.1.5, and the way that
"setopt" prints them correspondingly changed.

The only other time I've something that could be described as "options
not sticking" is when using a zsh that has been patched to add or change
the list of options, and then rebuilt without all the .o files getting
recompiled.
