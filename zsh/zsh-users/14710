I don't see why any of that would cause problems.

I can't see anything simple, that doesn't involve debugging the completion
code, unless other people can provide data points.  I'll try to remember to
have a go at home where the Cygwin set up is a bit different (and I don't
use it as much so I may well not have tried completion after drive
letters).
