Hi Peter!

Im rather new to the zsh. But I want to learn more.

When I type ^xh I get the following:
tags in context :completion::complete:cd::
    local-directories  (_alternative _cd)

How do you get the other entries?

When I do this, I get a list of all subdirectories, no matter if I
typed already the beginning of a directory name. So I am not sure,
what this command does.


Another related question:
I want to "bookmark" some directories.
e.g.:
~/project1/subdir/wiki
~/data/txt/info1
~/scripts/python
...

I want to type only a substring of the target directory in a cd
command (something like ido in emacs)
e.g.: cd ki changes to ~/project1/subdir/wiki

Is something like this possible with zsh?

Stefan.
