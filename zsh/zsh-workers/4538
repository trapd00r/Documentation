There seem to be an awful lot of completion bugs related to missing or
misplaced calls to fixsuffix().  Those bugs weren't present in 3.0.5.
I was was not paying much attention to 3.1 until just before 3.1.4 (too
busy with "real life") so I sort of glossed over all the changes that
turned zle into a module, etc.  Was whatever reorganization required
the addition of fixsuffix() really a good idea?  It doesn't -seem- like
something that should need to be done in so many different places ...
