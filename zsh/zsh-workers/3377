:Hmmm ... My ZSH 3.0.4 doesn't say "BUG: wrong character in hungetc()", but

One of the things I like least, and would probably require a big patch, is
that when parsing fails or gets interrupted, eg. CTRL-C during spelling
confirmation, the line only gets stored in history up to (approximately)
where it got up to.  

:I don't recall to use any patches for 3.0.4

You're getting the same bug.  "BUG:" lines don't appear unless you have the
right debug define set, eg. via configure, and I presumed that most of us
working on it would, like me, define them all.  But it's good that you get
reproduce it.  It'll mean that most other people probably can too, which 
means we'll let them fix it :-)
