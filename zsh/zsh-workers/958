The command in the subject line: `echo $(wc <(wc /vmunix) <(wc /vmunix))' locks up
zsh (at least my version 2.6-beta13-hzoli13 on SunOS 4.1.3) when ^C is hit immediately
after hitting return.  I'm afraid I've no idea why, but it's obviously a bit tedious.
Maybe I'll use =(...) instead - that seems to work ok.
