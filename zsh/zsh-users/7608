Hello List!

I'm working with Zsh for about a year now, but I almost treated it as a
"Bash replacement". Since last week, I have been reading on the manpages
several times and added some keybindings like directory listing (instead
of typing 'ls -l' or 'll').
Now my question, because I ran out of ideas: What keybinding would you
prefer or do you have?

Thanks for reply!
