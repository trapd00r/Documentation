Are you saying that, while you are editing inside vi, the editor freezes
so you can't edit (within vi) any more?  This doesn't look like a shell
problem; if the same thing happens when you are at the shell prompt as
well as in vi it suggests some strange terminal behaviour.  When vi is
running, the shell is sitting in the background waiting for vi to exit;
that's its sole task.
