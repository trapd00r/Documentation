} completion has stopped working on ~1/... etc.

What are your styles?  This works for me.  Well, it sort of works; I first
get ~1/ --> ~+1/ and then completion after ~+1/ works as expected.

This problem was reported at least once before by somebody else, but the
mailing list archive is not responding right now so I can't look it up.
