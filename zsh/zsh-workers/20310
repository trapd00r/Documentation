Subject: Bug#269769: zsh: sabcmd completion doesn't work

Package: zsh
Version: 4.2.1-3
Severity: normal

zsh refuses to complete on stylesheet and XML filenames for sabcmd.
For instance:

$ zsh -f
greux% autoload -U compinit
greux% compinit
greux% ls
file1.xsl
greux% sabcmd [TAB]
file1.xsl

I just get the menu, but the completion doesn't work.
