I suppose the first is probably more useful.  The times when you want to
narrow your search window are less than the ones when you want to widen
it.

I suspect the number of people using this feature is likely to be small,
though.  As far as I can see, _next_tags is about the only use of this,
since the globbed files and directories have in both cases already been
tested when we get to all files, so the difference is invisible for
producing the initial completion list.
