/From Bash to Z Shell/ has a great chapter on truncating the path in  
the prompt for ZSH.

There is some illusion to truncation "by segment" vs. total length:

"...The example therefore shows you how to limit the amount of a  
directory printed by the total number of characters rather than by  
the numbers of segments in the path."
    Page 157-156, Chapter 7

So how to by segment? Is it in the Bash section of this chapter? I  
skipped that part. :)

How I do it in tcsh now:

if ($?prompt) then
     set prompt = "%n@%m %B[%b%c03%B]%b %% " # doesn't want to work  
in ZSH
     set cdpath = (~ ~/Documents ~/Projects)
     set ellipsis
endif

Basically, total length is nice, but not as nice as by segment, IMHO.

Thanks,
Tim
