prepaths comes from the -W option (see the zparseopts call), which is used
when you want the file matcher to behave as if there was a path
prefix---for example, to complete folders in your mail directory, you might
use "-W ~/Mail".

I think the reason it's not an empty array is that matches are eventually
generated in a loop over all -W paths.  If there are none, we still want to
execute that loop once, but with an empty prepath (at line 340):

for prepath in "$prepaths[@]"; do
