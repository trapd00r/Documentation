Apparently no-one's done screen yet, it would be useful to have a function.

There are various strands.  First (or maybe last) you probably want to look
at one of the many functions that use _arguments to handle options and
arguments, so you can handle these for screen.

Then you need to persuade _arguments to handle the remaining arguments as a
new command.  Look at, for example, Completion/Unix/Command/_rlogin.  This
has already got some simple _arguments handling for you.

Finally, you want to be able to postprocess the output of `screen -ls' to
get detached sessions to reattach to.  A very simple example of adding
a list from the output of a command occurs in Completion/Zsh/Type/_limits.
