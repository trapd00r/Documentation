What is baz?  Some quick web searches didn't really turn anything up.

It sounds like it is an offshoot of Tom Lord's Arch.  The _larch
completion was something I generated based on the help output from the
Tom Lord's arch tool back in 2002.   It looks like _tla might be the
better completion function for arch now.  It was added in 2004.  So it
seems like _larch should be removed from the distribution. It's large,
and doesn't seem like it would be used by folks. (correct me if I'm
wrong)

I'm not too familiar arch, and any offshoots. So if tla, larch, and 
baz are all different flavors of arch, it would make sense to somehow
combine then. If there are a bunch of flavors of this tool, it would
be nice if someone could give a good pointer.

-FR.
