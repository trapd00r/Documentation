Yes. For unset 'a[b]' to not be an error is entirely consistent with
unset b not being an error when there is no b variable.

What I think should change is that unset 'a-b' should produce an error.

We've also got:
% vared not-here
vared: no such variable: not-here

I actually think there would be some sense to trying to use variable for
the documentation and error messages even if the internals and some
things like the zsh/parameter module can't be changed. Similarly the
documentation could prefer declare to typeset.

Exactly. So the ideal error message would be one complaining that `-' is
readonly.
