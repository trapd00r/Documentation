This should work with a sufficiently recent version of zsh to have the
"always" construct:

    inner () {
	if ((trips++))
	then
	  {
	    print "Do the multiple-trip thing ..."
	  } always {
	    ((--trips))
	  }
	fi
    }

    outer () {
      {
	setopt localoptions nolocaltraps
	integer -g trips=1
	trap inner INT
	print "Doing something useful now ..."
	sleep 2
      } always {
	unset trips
	trap outer INT
      }
    }
    trap outer INT

With that, even if I press ^C and hold it down, it alternates between
"Doing something useful now ..." and "Do the multiple-trip thing ..."
and ends up with "trips" unset.  Of course, this is on Linux; if you
are right about the NetBSD signal behavior, you'll need something more
subtle.
