I *think* that would be cool.  I'm not sure I understand much of this, but 
would it make the existing cdpath completion semi-trivial?  If that's the kind 
of thing it's supposed to do, then I'm all in favour---completing for cd 
directories darn well should be trivial!  On the other hand, I can't think of 
other cases where this would be useful.

Anyway, these seem important and useful changes, and I look forward to a 
release with them in.
