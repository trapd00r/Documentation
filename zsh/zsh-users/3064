Is anyone of you running zsh-3.1.6/7 with the cygwin 1.x system? 

(Compiling works fine, invoking a non-builtin-command 
yields a status access violation on my system (WinNT 4 + SP5))

NOTE: I have already opened a thread in the cygwin mailing list,
but if one of you has some usefull information to this issue, there
could be a nice synergy-effect for both mailing lists ;-)

Thanks!
