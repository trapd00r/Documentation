With current CVS and exec.c:2178 changed to zwarn, the failed redirection
from a builtin behaves as the failed redirection from a forked command, or
however that should be expressed in English.

I can't see any value to not doing it this way except perhaps in interactive
contexts, and even then it's a bit counterintuitive.  I would expect something
like

echo blah blah blah >>logfile || echo log problem | mailx pagesomeone

to do the same thing as

/bin/echo blah blah blah >>logfile || echo log problem | mailx pagesomeone
