That makes it easy.  I'm in two minds about one thing, though:  should it
still be possible to turn on the readonly flag for a special?  The problem
is that once on, you can't turn it off.  That may be still be useful,
though.  Or we can introduce a flag PM_SPECIALREADONLY which has the same
effect as PM_READONLY but can't be reset (and we complain if the user tries
to change PM_READONLY if that's set).
