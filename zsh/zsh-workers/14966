Subject: zsh 4.0.1 build fails on Nextstep 3.3

Hi,

I get error from configure:

>checking where signal.h is located... awk: syntax error near line 1
>awk: illegal statement near line 1
>/usr/include/bsd/sys/signal.h
>checking where the RLIMIT macros are located... /usr/include/bsd/sys/resource.h

>zsh configuration

>zsh version               : 4.0.1

>executable linker flags   :   -s
>library flags             : -ltermcap -lm


and compiling fails:

awk -f ./signames2.awk sigtmp.out > signames.c

Updated `zsh.mdh'.
