We need to upgrade our zsh here at school, and I now wonder what do
you recommend, should I wait a month or so for 2.6 (any release
plans?) or should I take 2.5, or even maybe if the 2.6 beta 3(?) if it
is stable?

I don't want to tell our sysadm, well install it, and then come one
week later and say.. oops new version :-)
