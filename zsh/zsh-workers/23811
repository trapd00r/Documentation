Heyla,
the following command is checking something invalid:

% ( echo & )
 jobs.c:1254: No valid job in waitjobs.

[1]    4693 segmentation fault (core dumped)  (; echo &; )
%

Replace echo with any command, including ``:''.  Some other
commands don't produce the jobs.c debug warning.

Regards,
Geoff
