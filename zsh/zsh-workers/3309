I am getting core dumps at 4:42am every day on one (remote) account of
mine.

I have no idea whatsoever what is causing this.  I never see a core file
dump.

1) there is a way to use the core files to figure out what is happening
(ie so we can fix it)

or

2) is there a way to prevent the core dump files


Sorry if this is vague, this is my first real experience with core dumps.

zsh version 3.0.0
SunOS kira 4.1.4 6 sun4m
