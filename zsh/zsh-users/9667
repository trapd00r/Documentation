Actually, it had a bug in it early in the output (which changed
recently).  This has prompted me to make it less horrific:

#!/bin/zsh
for var in SSH_AUTH_SOCK SSH_AGENT_PID DISPLAY WINDOWID SSH_TTY SSH_CLIENT SSH_CONNECTION SESSION_MANAGER; do
    if [[ -n "${(P)var}" ]]; then
	echo "export $var=${(P)var}"
    else
	echo "unset $var"
    fi
done >~/.screenenv
