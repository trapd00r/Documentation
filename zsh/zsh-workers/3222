Just tried the last beta - libzsh.so is not installed at all. I recall,
the problem existed in earlier versions as well. 

BTW I use 'make install' to build a package (in SVR4 sense) - first I
spool it in temporary directory and then make package out of it. Currently
the problem is, that when I do
  make -e prefix=/tmp/dir install
the paths (module and doc) are updated. It would be fine to have the
ability to shift installation without disturbing them.

thanks
