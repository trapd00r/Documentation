I don't know if anyone has already pointed this out, but in the user guide
section 5.4.2:

  perl                          zsh
  -----------------------------------------------------------------
  %hash2 = %hash;               typeset -A hash2; hash2=(${(kv)hash})

Surely this should be hash2=("${(@kv)hash}") in case of empty string
values.

Also, a little above in 5.4.1, this bit is not quite right (missing the
'array[]').

 % array=(some words)
  % args() { print $#; }
  % args ${(r)s*}
  1
  % args ${(r)X*}
  0
  % args "${(r)X*}"
  1

Cheers,

Martin.
