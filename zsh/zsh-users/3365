[eric@plum ~]$ bash
bash-2.03$ perl -e 'print "abc "'
abc bash-2.03$ perl -e 'print "abc \n"'
abc 

</cut and paste from terminal>

With zsh, I have never been able to get output of a perl command
unless an explicit "\n" is entered.  A straight echo or even:
echo 324542| sed 's/3/9/g'
does print out. (Also there is that weird `"'abc' output.

With bash all is as it should be.

Any ideas where I could look t fix this?
