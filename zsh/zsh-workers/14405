Actually, unsetting special variables should work --- I hope we're getting
there.  Anyway...

The simplest way I can think of is to use the parameter module.  The
associative array $parameters has keys which are parameter names and values
which are the types, which contains what you want to know.  (You can get
that type information for a parameter with ${(t)paramname}, but you have to
use e.g. typeset to generate a a list of parameters to test, so this method
is a bit easier.)  Something like:

zmodload -i zsh/parameter
for param in ${(k)parameters}; do
  type=${parameters[$param]}
  [[ $type != *export* || $type = *special* ]] && continue
  unset $param
done

Somebody may be able to think of a faster way.
