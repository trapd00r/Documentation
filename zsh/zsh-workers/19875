This is a better patch, although it's not ideal, owing to the interface
of strftime which doesn't signal success or failure properly.

In general, please don't commit gross hacks to the archive unless they
are strictly necessary, since it just makes extra work later.  In this
case, the new hack was just disguising the fact that the previous hack
was allocating infinite amounts of memory without an exit test.  It's
not surprising the shell code is less than transparent in a lot of
places.

The second hunk is a bit imperfect, too, for the same reason --- well,
actually we could be smarter in returns from ztrftime than from
strftime, but at the moment we aren't --- but will at least ensure the
buffer is correctly terminated in cases like the present one.
