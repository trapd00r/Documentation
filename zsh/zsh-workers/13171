Subject: trivial patch to _rlogin to make rcp complete more like scp
Mime-Version: 1.0 (generated by tm-edit 7.106)
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII


If you say 

scp file hostTAB

where host is something that unambiguously completes to a host, scp
adds a colon to the end of the host.  If you then hit space, the colon
stays.

If you do the same with rcp, the colon disappears after a space.  The
same thing goes with user@.

I think that keeping the colon is the Right Thing (TM) since it
actually means something.  I often do scp file host: just to copy the
file to my top level home directory.  I do the same thing with rcp but
I have to retype the : to keep it from vanishing.

I'm not convinced that this is the right behavior with the @.  In any
case, this patch takes the -q's off of the _alternative call to
prevent this behavior in _rlogin for rcp.  I went ahead and did it for
the @ case as well so that rcp would be consistent with scp, but it
would also have been reasonable to change _scp to add the -q for the @
case....

The only way I could figure this out was to do a careful comparison
between the _rlogin and _ssh code.  The -q flag to _alternative seems
to be either missing from the documentation or very well hidden.

This patch is relative to the current CVS....

I think I may end too many sentences with strings of four dots....
