} to my ~/.zshrc, auto-rehash works fine!

I'd forgotten about that article (and it wasn't obvious that was what
you were asking about).

It'd be interesting to try combining the two ideas, though:

    _force_rehash() {
      if (( CURRENT =3D=3D 1 ))
      then
        local -a modified_path
        modified_path=3D( ${^path}(Nms$SECONDS) )
        (( $#modified_path )) && rehash
      fi
      return 1	# Because we didn't really complete anything
    }

I'd expect that to be less intrusive than running rehash on every
command completion, but I could be wrong about the cost of doing the
${^path}(Nms$SECONDS) glob.
