Well, yes, but I meant which volume.  Commands and Utilities?

} It says:
} 
}           Range expressions shall not be used in Strictly Conforming
}           POSIX.2 Applications because their behavior is dependent on the
}           collating sequence.  Range expressions shall be supported by
}           conforming implementations.

I just love it when committees do stuff like that.  What does it mean for

I still think that in this case the cure is worse than the disease.
