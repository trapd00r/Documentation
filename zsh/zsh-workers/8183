} Why is it that '|' occasionally inserts one character before the cursor?

I'm going to take this to mean, "When I type '|', why is it occasionally
inserted one character-position to the left of the cursor?"

It has to be some sort of auto-remove-suffix behavior.  You'd probably
see the same thing happen with ';' if you typed that instead.  Can you
tell whether this occurs only following a completion?  (Not after _any_
completion, but never when there has been no completion?)
