At first I was a bit mystified by

	.../share/zsh/4.3.9-dev-2/% zcompile -zU functions functions/*
	zsh: unmatched "
	zcompile: can't read file: functions/VCS_INFO_get_data_svk

until I noticed the unmatched brace.  My first thought was to remove
the extra '${' in the last argument, but looking at similar functions
rather makes me question if some extra piece is missing.  Frank?
