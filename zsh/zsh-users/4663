You can still purchase a cygwin "buy-out" license but it sounds like,
for this application, it is just simple enough to provide the sources
under the terms of the GPL.

Note that if you provide the Cygwin DLL, you have to make sources
available for it as well, not just zsh.

The cygwin buy-out would allow you to not distribute the sources for the
DLL.  That means that you'd only have to worry about the ZSH licensing
terms which seem pretty straightforward.

Again, I am not advocating this.  It seems like it should be pretty easy
to just tar up the cygwin sources for whatever you're distributing and
include them somewhere on a CD or, alternately, be ready to provide the
sources if someone asks for them.

(No, just pointing to the cygwin web site isn't enough to satisfy the GPL)
