The ? is a special character for the shell (which cannot know
whether the argument is a filename or not). There are 2 solutions:

1. Quote the character manually, e.g.

     cmd foo\?bar

   or

     cmd "foo?bar"

2. Quote the character automatically:

     autoload -Uz url-quote-magic
     zle -N self-insert url-quote-magic

   in your ".zshrc".

Note: solution (2) is only a heuristic, which works well in practice,
but may need more configuration in specific cases.

Not necessarily a good solution, as curl also works with filename
arguments.
