} I find it humorous that my old code did the right thing in this case
} but for the wrong reason.  The new code will still search for "fc ",
} but because it properly decided to start a new search.

I hope not ... the new code ought to search for "fc" (without the space),
because of the !iblank(line[histpos]).  By neither interpretation was the
old code doing the right thing.
