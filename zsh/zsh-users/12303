X-Virus-Scanned: ClamAV using ClamSMTP

i think i know the answer to this, but i'll ask anyway...

 	% uname -s
 	FreeBSD

 	% print -P %D{%Z}
 	NZDT

meanwhile, on linux....

 	% uname -s
 	Linux

 	% print -P %D{%Z}
 	Pacific/Auckland

is there a good way to get zsh to consistently report the TZ in either 
long or short format? or does it depend on the system's version of 
strftime?

 	"Once a government is committed to the principle of
 	 silencing the voice of opposition, it has only one
 	 way to go, and that is down the path of increasingly
 	 repressive measures, until it becomes a source of
 	 terror to all its citizens and creates a country
 	 where everyone lives in fear."
 		-- Harry S Truman, 8 August 1950
