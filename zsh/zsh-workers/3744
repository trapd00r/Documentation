I think that's still the plan.  It's just that there hasn't been a release 
from Zoltan for a long time, for some reason.  I'd hope that everything that 
Zefram's version has will be in the official release; I don't recall anything 
controversial (other than the bashisms in the compilation scripts, which were 
a oversight on Zefram's part).

I think so.  I only have access to Solaris2.5.1 and Linux (elf, 
2.0.something). On those platforms where it's supported, I think zle and other 
pretty important things are modules (typically), so I'd expect more complaints 
if it didn't work.
