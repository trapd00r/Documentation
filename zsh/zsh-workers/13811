Subject: Problem completing variables that contain spaces
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.30.0103280228200.1718-100000@phong.blorf.net>
MIME-Version: 1.0

I noticed that the new completion code in the latest zsh code is
having trouble completing a variable that expands to a value that
contains spaces.  For instance, I was trying to complete $PWD in
a directory path that contained a space:

 % mkdir 'two words'
 % chdir 'two words'
 % touch 1 2
 % ls -l $PWD/<TAB>

Instead of $PWD remaining unexpanded and starting menu completion, it
expands to something strange like:

    $PWD/full/path/goes/here/two\ words/

This problem is not specific to PWD.
