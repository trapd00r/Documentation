In a user-defined widget, calling "zle digit-argument" supplies a random
and usually very large (positive or negative) value to whatever the next
command happens to be.

(The value isn't really random ... it starts at 6, then 66, then 666, and
so on until it overflows into negatives after 666666666, at which point
the progression gets hard to follow.)
