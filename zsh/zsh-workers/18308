Because it's enormous?  "Back in the day" of 2400 baud modems when I was in
college, doing a "man zsh | write <user>" was considered by some to be
funny (before people got clever and did things like 'cat /dev/kmem | od |
write....).

However, on all the installs I have around have a zshall man page that
people can get to if they really want.
