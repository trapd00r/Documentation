Hello.

(Please reply directly to me, I am not subscribed)

>From the FAQ, to be able to use zsh in shell-mode, I need
to disable zle.

If I do that, I loose completion.  So, I love emacs,
and I love zsh's way of completion.

Is there any way one could run zsh in shell-mode, and still get
completion working (preferable in a second emacs *Completion* buffer)?
