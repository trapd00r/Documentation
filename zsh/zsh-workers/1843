What I know about portable Makefile writing suggests that $< can only
be relied upon in an implicit rule (consider: it could refer to more
than one file, or none, in an explicit rule).  $@ is the only special
variable that is always available in all rules.

So I'm not surprised at the above failing with some makes.

>  zsh.info: zsh.texi
>! 	-$(MAKEINFO) -I$(srcdir) $?

But that's not the best way to fix it -- better to use the actual
filename.
