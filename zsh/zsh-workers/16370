Hi,

this year I don't have a patch I can use to sneak in my best wishes to
you for the follwing days, so I though I'd waste a little bandwidth,
sorry.


So,

   Fröhliche Weihnachten und einen guten Rutsch ins neue Jahr!

Read you next year...


Bye
  Sven

P.S.: I now have my Linux-machine connected and all and if this mail
      makes it through, everything's working nicely ;-)
