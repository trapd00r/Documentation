I am working with an installed application and trying to override a 
built in script using a ZSH function.  Sometimes the script (foo) is 
called from other scripts by creating a sub-process call :

## sample from script calling
OUT=`foo arg1 arg2`
echo $OUT

I am looking to override this script with a function call to leverage an 
existing authentication handle.  Is this possible?  I have tried using 
named pipes and shell expansion with no luck.

## Override with function
function foo() {
  echo "args $@";

## Trying to pass back to calling process which has shared 
authentication handle
    echo $@ >($$)

    kill -INT $$

}

## This is initiated in calling process which has access to shared 
authentication handle.
sigint foo_handler()
{
  if [[ -z $HANDLE ]]
  then
    resource_connect
    HANDLE=$$
  fi

  while read ARGS
  do
    resource_call $ARGS
  done

}

trap foo_handler INT
