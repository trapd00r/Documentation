The problem is something I asked some time ago: a-a-i-n-h has problems 
when the completion it tries generates only one or two matches. In
this case there is only one (CVS), so instead of accepting that it
leaves menu-selection and the undo then removes the slash. Probably
some messed up undo state, I'll have a look. But the real problem with 
this is the a-a-i-n-h behaviour. What should it do when there are no
matches or only one? I would definitely prefer it if it didn't leave
menu selection. For one match this would show that match, quite
reasonably, but when there are no matches? Ideas, anyone?

Bye
 Sven
