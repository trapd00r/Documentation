: former problem, at least.

One point here: the users list and workers list have _never_ had a valid
email message only composed of html.  All messages I receive like that
are put into a (very) low priority reading queue (just in case someone
does send such an unlikely beast).

For people using procmail, just insert a bitbucket recipe for them.
