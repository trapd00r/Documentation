} Note that it says "termcap" codes.  The great thing is that on Solaris,
} it will actually contain terminfo capability names (which is what we
} want), but under ncurses, it will contain termcap capability names.

the `codes' arrays the termcap codes.  Do you mean that the two will be
the same under ncurses?
