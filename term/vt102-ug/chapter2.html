<H2 ID="S2.1">General</H2>
<P>The VT102 has a built-in serial printer interface that connects to an optional
serial printer. The terminal performs several print operations selected
from the keyboard and computer. This chapter describes the print
operations and how to select them from the keyboard. <A HREF="chapter5.html">Chapter 5</A> describes
how the computer selects print operations.</P>
<H2 ID="S2.2">Print Operations</H2>
<P>The optional serial printer connects to the terminal printer interface (<A HREF="figure2-1.html">Figure
2-1</A>). The terminal uses the printer interface signals to determine if a
printer is connected and ready to print. If a printer is not connected, the
terminal ignores requests for printing. If a printer is connected but unable
to print, print requests cause the terminal to wait for the print operation to
end. While the terminal is waiting, it cannot display new characters on the
screen. After the print operation ends, the terminal can display new characters.</P>
<P CLASS="note">NOTE: You can cancel print operations by entering and exiting SET-UP.
If you stop printing by entering and exiting SET-UP, you must move the
printhead to the left margin.</P>
<P>Printing uses four print operations: auto print (line at a time), print screen,
printer controller, and print cursor line. The computer can select all print
operations while the terminal is on-line. You can only select the auto print
and print screen operations from the keyboard; however, you can select
them while the terminal is on- or off-line. If the terminal is off-line, KBD
LOCKED comes on until printing ends.</P>
<P>A line of double-height, double-width characters prints as the same line
twice, using single-height, single-width characters. Double-width characters
print as single-width characters.</P>
<H3 ID="S2.2.1">Auto Print (Line at a Time)</H3>
<P>Auto print operation prints the current display line before the cursor
moves to the next line. The cursor moves when the terminal receives a
linefeed, form feed, or vertical tab character. (The terminal also transmits
this character to the printer at the end of the printed line).</P>
<P>If the auto wrap SET-UP feature is on, characters received when the cursor
is at the right margin automatically wrap to the next line. Before the
cursor moves to the next line, the current line prints. The auto wrapped
line ends with the carriage return and linefeed characters. Select auto
print by using the following procedure.</P>
