Oops, I cut bits from two different traces there.  The first bit should
have read:

: _expand:24:else; word=${(M)${(f)$(<=(print -l *))}:#*conf*}

} I don't quite see where the quotes are getting stripped off, unless it's
} actually get_comp_string() that's at fault.

Guess what ... around line 1376 of zle_tricky.c ... I'm at a loss for
what that code is meant to be doing or when it is ever the right thing.
