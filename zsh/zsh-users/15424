You are using the new completion system (with compinit), I suppose?

To get completion without having to type the slash after .., you need

zstyle ':completion:*' special-dirs ..

There was a confusion in some versions of the shell, sorry... it was always
the intention (and documented under the style) that you needed to set this
style, but at one point I broke it so that it always had the behaviour.
