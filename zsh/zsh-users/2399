Hi all,

I am a zsh newbie still struggling to understand the power of compctl. I
have one requirement. How can I use compctl to complate make targets? I
can illustrate my requirements:
suppose I have 'Makefile' in my current directory with targets
xx:
yy:
zz:
clean:
clobber:
now I want to program compctl in such a way that $make <TAB> will list all
the targets for make.

Any help will be welcome.

Thanks and regards,
Raju
