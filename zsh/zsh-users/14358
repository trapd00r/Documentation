Hi all,


When I use zsh' ksh emulation mode, the following lines in /etc/kshrc
result in errors:

autoload -Uz edit-command-line
zle -N edit-command-line
bindkey -M vicmd 'v' edit-command-line

The errors are:

/etc/kshrc:4: command not found: zle
/etc/kshrc:5: command not found: bindkey
/etc/kshrc:4: command not found: zle
/etc/kshrc:5: command not found: bindkey
/etc/kshrc:4: command not found: zle
/etc/kshrc:5: command not found: bindkey

However, the same 3 commands do work when I put them in /etc/profile and
log into my ksh. The downside with /etc/profile is that it's not read
for subshells.=20



Regards
