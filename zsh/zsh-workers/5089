We could give free the zle-parameters (LBUFFER,...) in completion
widgets and then do something like:

  local lastl lastr

  if [[ "$LBUFFER" != "$lastl" || "$RBUFFER" != "$lastr" ]] then
    lastl="$LBUFFER"
    lastr="$RBUFFER"
    return
  fi

We should make them readonly in completion widgets, though (since the
match-inserting code could get terribly confused otherwise).

Would that be enough?

Bye
 Sven
