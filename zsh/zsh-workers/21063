Thanks Bart!

Here are the settings that I use now.
I use F5 and Shift-F5 to call the history complete functions.

## dabbrev for zsh!!
zstyle ':completion:history-words:*:history-words' stop yes
zstyle ':completion:history-words:*:history-words' list no
zstyle ':completion:history-words:*' remove-all-dups yes
zstyle ':completion:history-words:*' menu yes
bindkey '\e[15~' _history-complete-older #F5
bindkey '\e[28~' _history-complete-newer #Shift-F5


Stefan.
