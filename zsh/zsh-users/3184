} Only little question I have now is what value do you give LOGCHECK to
} print who's logged on when the shell first starts?

You don't; LOGCHECK only controls how often zsh checks for *change* in
the list of users who are logged on.

What you want is to put the command

	log

in your .zlogin file.
