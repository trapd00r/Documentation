There are two things I could do.  The first is put in a Makefile target
so that "make touch" will touch all the right files in the right order.
The second is add some code to the "make dist" code so that when I
make a distribution, it comments out the Makefile dependencies for
configure.  That way if a patch changes configure or configure.in, then
it will not try to run autoconf or autoheader.

Hmm...  I think I like the second option.  I'll try to work on it
later this week.
