Sorry, I didn't get round to testing this patch yet, but I'm
still curious what platform this test is needed for: ie on
which platforms is tcsetpgrp broken?  If for example it has
always worked correctly with glibc and most other platforms
then it would be nice if it could just be skipped for those
systems, or rather just run on the affected platforms: that
would simplify things for the builder IMHO and remove the
need for another (somewhat cryptic) configure option.
