Hi Peter,

I've had a look in the current HEAD version of hashtable.c, though I
have not compiled and tried it hands-on. But if I'm right, only
regular&&executable files are added to the hashtable. At least on my
Debian system, there are a lot of symlinks in /usr/bin to keep track of
different versions. So I think you should keep symlinks in mind, aswell.
If that's already the case, sorry for this, but my libc knowledge is
really small.

Cheers,
    eike
