Subject: Brace expansion from arrays?

Hi,

Out of sheer curiosity, I was wondering if it was possible to brace
expand {stuff,to,expand}to from arrays too, that is

a=(stuff to expand)
print {$a}to

would output "stuffto toto expandto"

Prelimanary man page grepping and testing indicated: no.  So, is there
a way to get the same effects from array expansion? And, would
automagic brace expansion from arrays be 1) useful and 2) hard to
implement?
