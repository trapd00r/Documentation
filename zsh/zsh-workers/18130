    Hi all :))

    That f*cking 'big@boss.com' is spamming me not thru zsh, as
usual, but to my own address. The problem is that I only have the
address of Ecurie-Levy.com (obviously forged) to contact with its
ISP. I read here, a few days ago, that someone contacted with the ISP
of this stupid, or something like that.

    If you could tell me who to wrote to for solving this issue I
will appreciate :))

    Raúl
