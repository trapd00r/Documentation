If you mean the gzipped file is a shell script then it's pretty easy:

exec_gz () {
        eval "$(gunzip -c $1)"
}

so you can do

exec_gz myscript.gz

In case the gzipped file is a binary (read: the file _before_ gzipping is a
binary) I think there is no way to do this. The OS (at least a few unices,
e.g. linux) needs the executable to be present as a file on a filesystem.


Pista

ps: Maybe the shell creates a temp file or pipe for the output of gunzip, I
can't check it right now.
