Hi-

I sent email about various problems a little while ago & figured I'd send
a "final" build report.  After #ifdef'ing a SIGWINCH occurrence in
signals.c for an old HP-UX 8.0 system that didn't have SIGWINCH, I
successfully built zsh-2.6-beta12 on the following systems (slightly
edited 'uname -a' results):

    basil:      IRIX basil 5.2 IP12 mips
    block:      FreeBSD 2.1.0-950928-SNAP i386
    deck:       OSF1 V3.2 17 alpha
    grace:      SunOS 4.1.1 1 sun3
    hoki:       HP-UX B.08.00 A 9000/42E
    kumquat:    AIX kumquat 1 4  (AIX 'oslevel' = 4.1.4.0)
    mace:       HP-UX A.09.05 A 9000/710
    main:       SunOS 5.3 Generic_101318-70 sun4m
    roughy:     AIX 2 3  (AIX 'oslevel' = 3.2.5.0)
    sophia:     ULTRIX 4.4 0 RISC
    spud:       SunOS 4.1.1 7 sun4c

and I gave up building on this system:

    olivia:     HP-UX A.08.00 B 9000/835

probably because of local misconfigurations, but we only have one of those
and it's ancient and I never use it, so I don't really care about it too
much.

I notice that some of them don't appear in the beta13 Etc/MACHINES file:

    DEC Alpha with OSF/1 3.2 (I had to make the rpcsvc/ypclnt.h change)
    HP-UX 8.0 (on HP 9000/4xx, at least & with SIGWINCH #ifdef'd)
    IBM AIX 4.1 (currently running 4.1.4.0, but I think I may have built
                 it on 4.1.2.0(??))
    FreeBSD 2.1.0 (I built it on a prerelease "snapshot" and will
                   eventually build it on 2.1.0-release.  I've built an
                   earlier beta on 2.0.5-release just fine, too)


Now, since I've changed my login shell to zsh I might actually be able to
test it out a bit, but I don't use all of those systems regularly.  So
don't count on a whole lot of HP-UX 8.0 testing, for instance. :-))

Thanx,
