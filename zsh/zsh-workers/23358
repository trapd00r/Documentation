That's the biggest problem with the HTML format. That's why
there exist more advanced formats like the "info" formats. The
info format is inspired from books. There is a table of content
and an index, both searchable with completion, and the whole
document can be searched as well.

See the "g", "i", "m", "s" keys in info.

Typically:

info zsh
iexec<Tab>
