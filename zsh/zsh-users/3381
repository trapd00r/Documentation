O.K., once more. Was it clean install? Is it possible, that you have used
wrong cache file for some reason? I get exactly the above lines when I run
configure and it takes values from cache. If I remove config.cache and rerun
configure, I get clear error messages.

What are the values of ac_cv_have_func_aton etc from config.log? If they are
correct, configure fails to set defines for some reason.
