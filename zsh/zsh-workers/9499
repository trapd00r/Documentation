default and warnings (and the completer style is tested without tag at 
all). When I last cleanup up style/tag handling I mentioned that last
one, I think.

But, before we start modifying docs are something like this, I'd like
to repeat the question: would it be ok for everyone to make completer
names be preceeded by two colons? With that we could use this kind of
pattern:

... which is indeed wrong for the current state of the code. And I
really, really don't like having to use patterns like `:completion*:...'.
The only reason I didn't do that was because I had added the `::cmd:'
thing at that time already.

And: any suggestion for how to test the completer style with a tag?
Use the `default' tag (that just sounds weird, somehow, but maybe this 
is only my problem).

Sure. Everyone is kindly invited to tell us about h(er|is) favorite
style settings. Ahem.
