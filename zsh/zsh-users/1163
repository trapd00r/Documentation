I'm not sure what Perl has to do with your confusion, unless Perl uses
[[ .. ]] to signify arithmetic evaluation?  I'd check the Perl man
pages, but as they are split into 35 (!!!!!) sections, I won't.  Thank
goodness for "man zshall".

I think [[ ]] is a builtin version of the test command, with more
testing capabilities.

You probably wanted to use the (( )) construct in zsh, to do arithmetic
evaluation of your test.
