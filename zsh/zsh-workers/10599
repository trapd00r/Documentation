About an hour later now, and it still isn't there yet.

I've sent a number of messages asking about potential changes, to which
there have been no replies or at least no decision (e.g., 10346, users/3013,
users/2973, others).  Does Sven have any outstanding issues with completion?

} I would appreciate any opinions on whether fixing
} `export' to work locally in functions is a good idea.  We can now do export

} option for this.

I think it should work like ksh in sh/ksh emulation modes, but otherwise I
think the current behavior is OK.  That isn't exactly the same as having an
option; do you believe that also to be unsuitable?
