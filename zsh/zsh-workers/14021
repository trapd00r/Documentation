} Oh, that would be wonderful.  I remember me fighting with that several
} times (it can get pretty ugly with nested expansions and arrays).

Well, it's not as straightforward as I thought -- the parse gets tangled
up the with parsing of [[ ... ]], among other things -- and I just noticed
that you can get the equivalent effect by surrounding the whole thing with
braces:

% foo='any random string'
% echo ${foo[(i)dom str]}
8

So I think I'm going to leave it at 14008+14016 unless somebody comes up
with other bugs to zap.
