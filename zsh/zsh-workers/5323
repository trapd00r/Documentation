Okay, I'll do that.

The current AWK based scheme doesn't handle cross compiling.
It assumes that whatever "signal.h" file it finds that has
something like "#define SIG*" in it is the correct one and 
then does a bad job at being a C preprocessor to extract 
the signals.  The only time it would get it right is if the 
target architecture has the exact same set of signals the 
host architecture does.  Coincidentally, my C based scheme 
has the same property.

So the new way doesn't change things.
