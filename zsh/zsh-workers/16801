Sorry, I didn't make my question clear.  I understand how it looks for
what to execute to find completions (though I wouldn't have guessed
about `-redirect--default-' without looking at the code, although that's
logical).  My question was, when I get where I'm going and try
completion, what context is seen by styles?  What I'm worring about is
if I'm in some generic form of redirection completion I can still check
for `-redirect-echo-2>' in pattern-files, or does the context still just look
like `-redirect-2>' or `-redirect--default-'?
