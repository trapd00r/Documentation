} Is there any chance of getting just a patch I can apply?

Also I was going to mention that in other places we typically have
used "-e" (mnemonic "eval") for things that allow quoted shell code
that will be executed later.  E.g. "zstyle -e", (e:...:), etc.

So I'd suggest "compdef -e" rather than -s.
