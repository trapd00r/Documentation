Hi all

First: I love ZSH!

Only thing bothering me is that ZSH tries to ALWAYS expand glob  
patterns, and gives an error if it can't. I'd prefer if when the  
expansion fails, it would pass the pattern on to the program being  
called. An example where this behavior is a pain:

find /usr/lib -type f -name *.so

does not work (as I expect it). Either there are some .so files in the  
current directory, and ZSH will expand (which is NOT what I want, but  
then BASH does it the same way), or it doesn't match, and I get an  
error. To get it to work I have to either quote or escape the globbing  
expression.

I do understand that the approach ZSH uses is the safer one as it  
enforces consistent behavior. But then, for quick work on the command  
line I find it a pain to always having to remember to escape or quote  
the pattern.

So my question: Is there any way to change the expansion behavior of  
ZSH? The man-pages and the FAQ didn't help me, nor did google. But  
then, I'm quite sure I didn't use the appropriate search terms...


Thanks

Michael
