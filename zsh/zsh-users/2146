} Hello ALL,

} I am not able to run shell script

} do not see any x permissions on the shell script.

There's not really any such thing as "x permission" in NT.  Anything with
the right file extension (.exe, .bat, ...) has "execute permission."  I
don't recall exactly how zsh's internal tests for executable-ness are
resolved in Amol's port.

} Is there a particular way of executing the shell script via the zsh

I don't believe so.

} Do I need to name the shell script in a
} certain way in order for it to execute?

Zsh first attempts to let the system run the named file, and then when
(if) that fails it looks at it for a #! line.  So ...

If you give the script a .exe extension, NT will try to run it as a
binary, I think.  Not good.

If you give it a .bat extension, it'll try to run it as a batch file.
That's probably even worse, as bits of the script might actually look
sensible enough to the batch processor to cause something to happen.

} I have tried including the
} following line at the beginning of the shell script:
} 
} #!c:/bin/zsh/zhs.exe 
                ^^
Did you spell "zsh.exe" correctly in the shell script?

Otherwise I'm without clue.
