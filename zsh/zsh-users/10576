Hi all,

I'm sorry if this is a FAQ, but all my googling was in vain. I also
found nothing appropriate in the zshall manpage.

Here's the problem:

There is a user 'proxy' on my system, when I now try to 'cd' into a
directory, let's call it 'profiles' the file/dir completion will offer
me 'proxy' as an alternative. Roughly like so:

% cd pro^D
local directory
profiles/
user
proxy

This is highly annoying behaviour, which I'd like to stop. I'm using the
default zshrc that get's shipped with zsh 4.3.2.

I think the Completion/Unix/_users might be responsible, is there a way
to selectively disable this completion scheme?

Bye,
Ulrich Spoerlein
