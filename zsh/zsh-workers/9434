zsh built with 
  ./configure --prefix=/space/akr/zsh/tmp --enable-zsh-debug --enable-zsh-mem-debug --enable-zsh-mem --enable-secure-free --enable-mem-warining
doesn't dump core.  It seems to work well.

Since `egrep 'HAVE_SYS_MMAN_H|HAVE_MMAP|HAVE_MUNMAP' config.h' says
follows, mmap is used, maybe.

#define HAVE_MMAP 1
#define HAVE_MUNMAP 1
#define HAVE_SYS_MMAN_H 1

Also note that I found zsh patched upto 9419 doesn't have the problem.
So I suspect the problem is related to 9421.
