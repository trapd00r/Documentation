Remember you can stick '+' at the end of a completion to use the
default as a default.  You could also try the patch I posted recently
for binding specific completions (find it at http://www.peak.org/zsh/ ,
it's called something like 'completion widgets' and should apply
cleanly to zsh-e.1.2-zefram3).  Then you do

zle -C alternative-tilde-expansion <completion options here>
bindkey "<key sequence>" alternative-tilde-expansion

and use the special key sequence.  This is probably the only way of
getting the level of control you want.

Either you have different expectations or a different version of the
shell from me.  Try with zsh -f again.  However, I don't understand
where you're expecting the second / to come from, since -W will strip
it --- it's for an implicit path, i.e. one which doesn't appear on the
command line.  I would simply omit the -W and type the second / by
hand or use some other compctl option to get it inserted if you
insist, or alternatively change the omitted prefix to 's[file://]'.
In fact, you shouldn't need to do even that since of course
'//users/...' is recognised as a path, and -W doesn't strip more than
you've asked it to.
