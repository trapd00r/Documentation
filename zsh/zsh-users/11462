} Nope, on MacOS with its case-preserving-but-insensitive file-system that

} zmv: error(s) in substitution:

} (Probably the same file, owing to file system limitations.)

Since you've already established that MacOS doesn't mishandle a "mv" where
the source and destination file names refer to the same file, it should
work just to do:

zmv -f '(*).(*)' '${(C)1}.${2:u}'

In general, though, I'd think this must be done in two steps.  E.g.:

% zmv '(*).(*)' 'tmp_${(C)1}.${2:u}'
% zmv 'tmp_(*)' '$1'
