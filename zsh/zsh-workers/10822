Put `zmodload zsh/compctl' in your `.zshrc'. Or better, use the new
completion system (autoloading and calling `compinit').


Ick. The problem is that in autoload_zleread() we do:

    if (load_module("zsh/zle"))
	load_module("zsh/compctl");

i.e., we attempt to load compctl only if loading zle succeeds. For
people who have a call to `bindkey' in their .z*, the zle module will
already be loaded, re-loading fails and compctl is not loaded. Bummer.

Can anyone think of a solution for this? I can't (apart from trying to 
load compctl unconditionally, which I don't like).

Bye
 Sven
