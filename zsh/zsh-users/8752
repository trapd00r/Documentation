Luckily, with debugging turned on, this output an error message
so I could find it without too much trouble.  It's yet another problem
with Meta characters.  (If this doesn't fix it report it again.)

Note that the bug turned up in the code which strips trailing whitespace
from the line.  This is the correct behaviour, but it's a not clear it's
what you want in a binary file.  You may need to set IFS to empty, as
DervishD mentioned.

Further discussion on the bug should go to zsh-workers.
