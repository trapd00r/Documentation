Yes, I could also achieve the desired output using a multi-lined prompt, but I 
would still have to perform the same check using the preexec-function that I 
mentioned in my original posting. (After just hitting enter, the exit status 
is not reset, and so it would be displayed a second time.)
The behaviour I want (and get, using the preexec-check) is:

% false
(1)
% <just hitting enter>
%

Thanks nonetheless,

Christian
