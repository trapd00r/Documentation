I've mentioned the (new) _make behaviour at least twice here,
objecting to it.  For me it was even worse: I had updated zsh from
CVS, which changed some .in files.  I did `make t<TAB>' in the main
zsh directory and that caused it to call autoconf and re-compile the
shell.

I wrote about this but got no reply from whoever put that code into
_make (I'm too lazy to look it up now).  I really think we should
either make it run make only if some style is set or come up with a
better test when to run it (or, probably better, a combination, where
the test decides what the default for the style should be in a
particular situation on a particular system).

At least we shouldn't let it out of the door in a state where people
might have to set a barely documented style to keep it from doing such 
horrible things.

Bye
 Sven
