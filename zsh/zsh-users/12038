================

no, you don't need the full path. but at the moment i'm fine with either 
`most` or "whatever the default is". if i wind up with a list of 
preferences (or even a 2nd preference) i'll definitely use the loop idea.

 	A student asked his old Sufi Master if he should tie up
 	his camel for the night, so that it wouldn't wander
 	away while they were sleeping or if doing so was an
 	insult to God. Should he leave the camel untied to
 	show his trust in God that the camel wouldn't run away?
 	The Master replied "Trust God AND tie up your camel."
