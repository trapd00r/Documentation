By the way, the favoured setting for printeightbit is now off.  iswprint()
is used where necessary for testing characters, and it should only
resort to prettified output if it doesn't like the character.

If it doesn't like the character, instead of the \M- style of output
the character is indicated with \u or \U as appropriate.
