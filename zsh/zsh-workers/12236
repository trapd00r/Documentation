} That was before applying the patch (the correct behaviour).  After, I get:
} 
} [[
} a
} =
} (
} ;
} 
} with interactivecomments set (which is wrong), and what Sven was reporting
} without it (which isn't great).  I'd much prefer the old behaviour in this
} case, but the interactivecomments variant is definitely broken.

The situation is exactly reversed inside a ZLE widget:  The behavior with
both interactivecomments and without is now correct inside the widget, but
broken outside.

So was all Sven's patch acheived to invert some condition?
