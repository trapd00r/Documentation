Bart Schaefer explained why it does this (basically the "correction 
feature" you conjectured), and gave a workaround at:

http://www.zsh.org/mla/users/2008/msg00472.html


Peter Stephenson provided a patch that's probably a better workaround:

http://www.zsh.org/mla/users/2008/msg00475.html

I think the patch should apply cleanly against Zsh 4.3.4 -- I'm pretty
sure that's what was in Cygwin at that time, and it solved my problem.
It's also been applied in CVS, and was there pre-4.3.9.

Best,
Ben
