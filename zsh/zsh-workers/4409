} Hi. I'm using zsh-3.1.4 on Solaris-2.6.

                           autoremoveslash, as you said in Subject:.

(automenu set or unset makes no difference to this bug)

For the record, this is also _NOT_ the bug for which PWS posted fixes
in articles 4124 and 4128 (search for "remove slash bug" with the new
zsh archive server).  I see the same behavior even with PWS's patches.

} Is this correct?

Unfortunately, I don't know the completion code well enough to answer.
