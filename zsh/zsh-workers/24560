I agree with "not necessarily," but I suspect it'll be right more
often than wrong to assume 1.  *Most* characters are not going to be
"non-printing," and if the mb library doesn't recognize them, then
they're also unlikely to be simultaneously multibyte and handled
correctly by the terminal.

I'll bet I argued this the other way when this came up the last time,
but now we have some empirical results.

I like this, but I'm wondering if it might not be better to have %{
accept a count, e.g., instead of %{...%6G%} just write %6{...%}.  Does
it matter where %G appears?  %{...%7G...%} ?  What if you use it more
than once, as in %{...%7G...%3G%} ?  Using a count on %{ might make it
more obvious that you should write %7{...%}%3{...%} if %7G%3G != %10G.
