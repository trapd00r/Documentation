> What difference between named directory and home directory?

The named directories are a list of directories for which a name is associa=
ted
explicitly by the user. That way, you can use the alias instead of the full
directory name. For example, if there is a variable
mydir=3D/home/me/foo/bar/qux
you can use ~mydir instead of /home/me/foo/bar/qux

The named directories are defined by the user by setting a variable to a va=
lid
path ; there can be as many as you want.


The home directories are the directories where users have their actual home=
.
This is defined by how the system is installed and can usually be changed
by root only. The shell treats the name of the user exactly as if it was a
named directory pointing to the home of the user, though there is no variab=
le
by that name. The home directories are defined in /etc/passwd, and are not
only used by the shell but a variety of other things, including the system
itself, even if most of the time the shell is the one who does the actual
substitution.


A last difference is that home directories can be reffered to as ~user in e=
very
shell I can think of, whereas named directories work in zsh only (and maybe
ksh, I can't remember).
