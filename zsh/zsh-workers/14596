} OK, I have to get it built first without the shell coredumping, which

You really can't use purify very well on a program that does its own
dynamic loading.  You will need --disable-dynamic.

Have you tried reading the INSTALL file?  There's a large section titled
"Adding and removing modules".  The short answer is that you edit the
config.modules file and change the values  of `link' and `auto' on the
line for the zpty module to be `static' and `no' respectively.
