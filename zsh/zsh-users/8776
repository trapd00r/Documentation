Hi

I have a script which as follows which works fine (where ftx is going to search for tex docs with
pink & main in the name) 

>ftx "pink.*main"

however I thought I'd convert it so that i could write

> ftx pink main

and then rebuild "pink.*main" string inside the function however it doesn't seem to work

param="$1.*$2"

$param is not treated the same as the original $1
