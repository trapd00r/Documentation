There is also .zlogin and .zshrc.

You should move all the "interactive" part of your .zshenv into .zshrc,
i.e. anything that you won't need to run your scripts. My zshenv is
mostly about setting $PATH and other non interactive env. variables.

While I'm sure there is good use for dot-login files, I never discovered
which would be these...

Oh, yes... there is .zlogout as well, but I haven't found a good excuse
to create one.

Cheers,
Francisco
