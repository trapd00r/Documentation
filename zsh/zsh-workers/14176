Subject: A minor glitch with _arguments
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Putting quotes around an option string convinces _arguments that it has
reached the end of the options.  E.g. using zsh's configure script as a
test case:

zsh% ./configure '--enable-dynamic' --<TAB>
No matches for `corrections'

Remove the quotes, or move the left one even one character to the right,
and everything starts completing again.
