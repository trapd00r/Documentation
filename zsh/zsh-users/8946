Hi,
     You probably already know about this, but you can set the XTRACE  
and VERBOSE options to get a better idea about what's happening  
either like this:

#!/bin/zsh -xv

or like this:

setopt XTRACE VERBOSE

I don't know of a zsh 'debugger' if that's more what you were looking  
for, but maybe someone else does.


Regards,
Ryan
