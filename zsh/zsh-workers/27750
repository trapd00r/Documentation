I have a widget that toggles $HISTFILE between empty and ~/.history,
and it used to work fine, but lately it's been writing some entries to
~/.history after i turn it back on that were entered while it was
empty, and i'm sure it used not to. It could be some option i've
fiddled with though, i just haven't felt like experimenting with it
yet. (of course this approach needs at least setopt incappendhistory).
