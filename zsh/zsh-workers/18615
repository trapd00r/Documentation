Is anyone updating the ChangeLog on the website,
http://zsh.sunsite.dk/Etc/changelog.html?  At least, the answer seems to
be no: someone spotted it was still 3.0.8.  It's visible from Freshmeat
using the `ChangeLog' link.

As it seems to be a minimally modified version of the real ChangeLog, it
would be easy enough for me to write a script to update it, but I
wondered if anyone knew about it and had `just been planning' to fix it
since May 2000.
