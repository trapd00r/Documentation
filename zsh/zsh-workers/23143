Here's a rationalization, so that == does find = (unless NO_EQUALS is
on, obviously), and likewise for any other metacharacters that haven't
been dealt with at the time of the = expansion (note this is before
globbing---necessarily in the case of ~-expansion which is performed at
the same time as =-expansion).

However, it's very tempting to make "==" an exception (and document it)
since it's kind of intuitively obvious (if you're a geek) that "==" is a
test for equality rather than an attempt to look for a programme called
"=".  Still, POSIX doesn't give any imperative reason to do so.

(In case anyone's unclear, == in [[ ... ]] is and has always been
handled specially because zsh understands the syntax of [[ ... ]],
so it doesn't get handled as a normal command.  [ ... ] and test, on the
other hand, are ordinary builtins, hence the problem.)
