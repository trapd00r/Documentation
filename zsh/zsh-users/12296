Subject: avoid interpretation of special characters
Message-ID: <20071206101149.GA10394@fruitcom.com>
MIME-Version: 1.0

User-Agent: Mutt/1.5.12-2006-07-14

For my command (say mut), I want to avoid shell interpretation of
characters like ~ and > or <
so when I go mut  ~f foo and ~r <2w ~r >1w
I want those characters passed literally to the script.
(instead of obviously have to use backslash or quotes for this
purpose.

Thanks!
