It's certainly strange, although it's not wholly illogical with $cdpath: as
the empty string is not an absolute directory nor begins with . or .., the
shell looks through $cdpath for the first directory for which the
concatenation with the empty string exists, which is usually just the first
directory in $cdpath.  This is almost useful...  It's easy to add an error
but I'm not quite sure at what stage the behaviour actually is an error in
this case: it's a correct, if unexpected, interpretation of the cdpath
rules.
