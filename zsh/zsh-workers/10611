Subject: Question


Currently, if a completion list is too long, the completion system
asks if onw wants to see all <n> matches. This is not only ugly in
cases like _complete_help with styles-output -- it askes if one wants
to see all `0' matches.

Should we change it to mention the number of lines needed? I think it
would always be more interesting.

Bye
 Sven
