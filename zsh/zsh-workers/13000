Subject: PATCH: Clarify doc for tty handling with job control.

This duplicates in the "Jobs and Signals" section some information from the
description of the STTY parameter about the way zsh restores tty modes upon
"fg", because it applies to any fg'd command, not just those with STTY in
the environment.  This came up as a sideline to my conversation with Gray
about the gdb STGTTOU bug.

I suppose I could have deleted the text from STTY and cross-referenced, but
it didn't seem extensive enough to make that worthwhile.

 tty option, then background jobs will suspend when they try to produce
 output like they do when they try to read input.
 
+When a command is suspended and continued later with the tt(fg) or
+tt(wait) builtins, zsh restores tty modes that were in effect when it was
+suspended.  This (intentionally) does not apply if the command is
+continued via `tt(kill -CONT)', nor when it is continued with tt(bg).
