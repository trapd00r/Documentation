But it isn't equivalent, because cd doesn't push things down on the
stack, just bring them to the top replacing whatever's there, unless
you have autopushd set, which I don't.  I don't want cd to push things
on the stack, that's why we have pushd.  I want cd to change
directories and pushd to push directories.  I don't think that's
unreasonable.
