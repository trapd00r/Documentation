This is supported by default by the _path_files functions that handles
completion in the new system.  Try:

  zsh -f
  autoload compinit
  compinit -D

(compinit -D prevents stomping on your .zcompdump file).  If it works
there you have somehow managed to turn it off in your initialisation files.

You can configure the settings for file completion, if that is the
problem, by running `compinstall' (completely misnamed for historical
reasons), selection `Styles for particular completions', then `Options
for file completion'.  There is an option there to choose how multiple
path segments are expanded.  Nothing there should actually disable it,
but there are subtleties as you will see.

If you find some blatant gotcha, please let us know.
