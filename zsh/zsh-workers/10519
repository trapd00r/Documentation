Subject: PATCH: AIX dep.&doc fix; development guidelines
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

The patch fixes the latest AIX dependency problem and fixes a minor
error in the docs. I haven't commited it to cvs (sorry Peter) because I
haven't got ssh and cvs in the same place yet.

It would be nice to have the zsh-development-guide updated to reflect
the new guidelines now that we have CVS. Also, I'm not entirely clear
myself on what these new guidelines are:

1. Has there been a final solution on how we are supposed to create the
ChangeLog entries. It'd be nice to have a solution that doesn't depend
on using emacs (I'm more than happy to learn cvs but don't have the
time, inclination or disc space to learn emacs). Is the ChangeLog
modified just like any other file on the cvs server? If people can only
send a patch should they still include a patch for ChangeLog?

2. Should we still post patches for everything in addition to commiting
to cvs? For some things (like these AIX dependencies) it is hardly
worth it. With many changes the patches are useful, particularly when
they are just to functions and a recompile isn't necessary. It is also 
useful that patches from people such as me can get sanity checked.

3. The .distfiles thing should be mentioned. I take it that we just add
and remove files from the list in it if we add and remove files?
