FWIW, my testing seems to indicate that bash maintains the status of
completed jobs until wait'ed on.  I've tested two jobs, and regardless
of the order in which they complete relative to the order they were
started, and also the order wait'ed on, wait seems to give the right
exit status.  Running 'jobs' does not seem to clear the status of
completed jobs.
