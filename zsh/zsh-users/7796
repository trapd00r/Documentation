I'd say they're not necessary and probably wrong, but as you haven't given 
any other context (such as, in what function or script did you find that 
snippet?) it's really not possible to be sure.

It otherwise might be, yes, but only if the value of $1 was a prefix of a
matching file name.

That error is printed in that format only when the nomatch option is set, 
which contradicts what you say next.
