No. fr_FR.UTF-8 doesn't necessarily exist. For instance, under Maemo
Linux, one needs to use LC_CTYPE=fr_FR, which is UTF-8, but under most
Linux-based platforms, fr_FR is ISO-8859-1, so that the charmap is
incorrect after a SSH, unless one uses some tricks (I use a LC_CHARMAP
variable in order to update the LC_CTYPE from my .zshenv if need be).
