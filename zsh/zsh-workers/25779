Hmmm... I'm not convinced this has got anything directly to do with the
shell rather than the debugger.  Here's what I get when I simply ask for
the PID repeated times:

---------------
./zshdb2.sh:7 ./zshdb2.sh:34
===============
(./zshdb2.sh:34):
. ./testing.sh
./zshdb2.sh:9 ./zshdb2.sh:34
zshdb<1> p $$
711
./zshdb2.sh:9 ./zshdb2.sh:34
zshdb<2> p $$
711
711
./zshdb2.sh:9 ./zshdb2.sh:34
zshdb<3> p $$
711
711
711
./zshdb2.sh:9 ./zshdb2.sh:34
zshdb<4> 

It looks like something is odd with whatever is holding the command to be
executed.  You know better than me how that works.
