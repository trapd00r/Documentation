Subject: PATCH: option for completion file-sort to follow symlinks

I have all my dotfiles under version control in a separate directory,
and ~/.zshrc ~/.zalias etc are symlinks to the version controlled
directory.

So even when I have: "zstyle ':completion:*:*:*:*' file-sort date"
doing vi ~/.z<Tab> sorts the files based on symlink modtime and not
the file that its pointing to.

The one line patch included into the end of this email adds one
additional option `follow' to the file-sort, which makes it follow
symlinks.

# follow symlinks when sorting
zstyle ':completion:*:*:*:*' file-sort date follow

Regards,
  Max
