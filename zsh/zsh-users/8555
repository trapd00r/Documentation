Hi all ! :)

 I just want to say "HELLO" -- I just subscribed to this list.
 A week ago I used ZShell the first time -- I am using Linux with Bash 
 since ten years though.

 I have a thre first question:
 I added the following line to my .zshrc

   zmodload zsh/zmv zmv

 then giving 

   zmv
 
 just as an test on the commandline gives me:

   zsh: failed to load module: zsh/zmv
   zmv: autoload failed

 Other commands like

   zmodload -a zsh/stat stat

 and then 

   stat <file>

 works fine.

 ????

 Another question:

   ls a<TAB>

 is /damn/ slow trying to complete.

 Bash in the same directory is much faster. I am sure I only have done
 something very wrong only...but what.

 A third question:
 Setting TERM=xterm-color corrupts my prompt, while setting it to
 TERM=xterm works fine, but corrupts many other progs like mc,
 alsamixer etc...

 Any idea?

 Thank you very much in advance!
 Kind regards,
 Meino
