Ok but how about the order? 
ESC 1 ESC . will give the last argument when in bash it means the first
one.

So I need to do something like insert the argument
n-x where n is the total number of words on the previous command(x is the
number after ESC).

Q: Is there a way to set the separator(or a list of separators) when doing backward-kill-word? For example if I'm typing:

% cd /usr/src^W
I would like to have
% cd /usr/
not 
% cd 
(this is also bash's behaviour)


PS: Maybe I'm too tired now but:
