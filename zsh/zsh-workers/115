I believe Tom Christiansen has written a version of man in perl that uses
ndbm for indexing.  Also tkman can use the database glimpse for similar
things.

As to building in completion support for this in zsh, I'm not sure.  I would
have to be convinced that it would be generally useful.   A possibility is
that I could put patches for such features in a Contrib subdirectory.  But I'm
tied up in other zsh work right now.
