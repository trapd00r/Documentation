Thanks, it was a simple off-by-one error from the last time I `improved'
the job table (with a slight recount to avoid `jobs' in a subshell from
crashing).  The actual bug was it wouldn't report the last job in the
list.  However, if the table was full that was the job running `jobs',
so you wouldn't notice.  If the table wasn't full, the `jobs' job would
go in the middle and the last one would be missing.
