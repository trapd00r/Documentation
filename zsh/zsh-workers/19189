} The printexitvalue option shows multiple exit values when MAILPATH/MAILCHECK
} is set and new mail is found.

I'm not able to reproduce this, but I suspect that it shows multiple exit
values when the mail check contains a call to an external command:
 
} MAILPATH='/home/dylan/mail?New mail in `basename $_`'
                                         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you change that to

    MAILPATH='/home/dylan/mail?New mail in $_:t'

what happens?

(Might need ${_:t} if you're using some ksh emulation options.)

If that doesn't change anything, you'll need to tell us more about your
environment, such as whether you have a precmd and what it does, whether
you have any TRAPxxx functions defined, etc.
