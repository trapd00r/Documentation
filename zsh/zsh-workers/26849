zsh@dotsrc.org, assuming that's what it's now called (was
zsh@sunsite.dk), would be more useful, but the question is who is
actually doing the work on the zsh side, not who has permission to
access it.  However, if you have some time to spare, do volunteer to be
added...  You might need to copy both addresses, I've rather lost track
of what's going on.
