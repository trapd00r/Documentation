Talking of fiddly little changes, if you have debugging turned on and
try to strip quotes from an expression needing RCQUOTES handling:

% ARG="'this is OK, isn''t it?'"
% print -r ${(Q)ARG}
Oops. Bug in parse_subst_string: len < l
'this is OK, isn't it?'

We could probably salvage the test with some ingenuity, but frankly I'd
rather it just worked for now...
