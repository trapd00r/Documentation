There is a little problem with output of chdir(). Here follows:

if I cd to non-local directory using CDPATH, cd will report current
directory after changing to it. I always found it boring (as I have
directory in prompt anyway) and suggested the option to shut it off. The
answer was (as expected ;) that I can use

cd () { builtin cd $* > /dev/null }

Well, it works, but any output from chdir() is also lost :( I don't
know, if it is right, that chdir() is using the same descriptor as cd, but
if it is to be so, may be new option is still useful? 

greetings
