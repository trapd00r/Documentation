But in my case, where soft is a named directory and software is a normal
directory in the cwd, soft shouldn't be seen as an exact match.

And what do you call an exact match? I don't understand your example.
I would agree if you had typed "/u/lib/n". But I don't see why lib
should be priviledged. Because it is shorter than lib64s? But I don't
think this is a good idea.
