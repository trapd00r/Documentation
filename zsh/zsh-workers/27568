On Tuesday 2010-01-05 07:32 -0800, Bart Schaefer output:
:I have a vague memory of when this was added, but it appears to have been
:sometime longer ago than when the zsh-workers archive begins and after
:the last zsh-2 archive I kept -- which means it was late 1994 or early
:1995.

Appeared in 2.5.03:

Fri Jul 29 20:24:07 1994  Richard Coleman
	* params.c: additional patch by Sven for safeguarding
	  size of array subscripts.

Fri Jul 29 20:06:24 1994  Richard Coleman
	* params.c,zsh.h: patch by Sven to add safeguard to size of
	  array subscripts.

I'm pretty sure that I've lost all that mail and I can't find references
to it on any search engines either.  What's the reason for comments in
code again? :-)

Regards,
Geoff
