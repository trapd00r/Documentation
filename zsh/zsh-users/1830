Heyla,
just a note about the change to the mailing list archives at 
<URL:http://www.zsh.org/mla/>  I have added Wilma/Glimpse to it to
add searchability _however_ I've run glimpse (the indexer) on HTML'd
files - which aren't exactly like the original thing so be aware of
that.  Otherwise, tell me of any problems and suggestions:  eg. whether
it's actually useful or not.
