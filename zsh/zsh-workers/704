I failed to build zsh on SCO Unix 3.2 release 5.0 with the configure.
I have to make the following adjustment, please modify the configure
accordingly.  The linked zsh works fine.

(1) in Src/system.h around line 114:

	/* We may need to define this for any machine    *
	 * that doesn't have gettimeofday.  Of course we *
	 * probably will move to the POSIX time function *
	 *  anyway.                                      */
	#ifdef __sco
	struct timezone {
	    short minutes;
	};
	#endif

    This ifdef is not necessary for release 5.0, maybe it was added
    for version before 5.0.

(2) I have to add:

	LDFLAGS=-lsocket

    otherwise I will get:
	Undefined                       first referenced
	 symbol                             in file
	yp_all                              zle_tricky.o
	getdomainname                       zle_tricky.o
