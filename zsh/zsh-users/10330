    Hi Meino :)

    Probably because you don't have read or execute permissions for
the script :?? You can execute the contents because you're entering
them in the command line, but that has nothing to do with the
problem you have.

    "sed". Or Perl, if you know Perl but don't know sed. It's tricky,
anyway, because not all escape sequences have the same length :((

    Probably there is a much clever trick to achieve what you want,
but I'm not aware of it, sorry :(((

    Good luck!
