:LIST_TYPES AUTO_LIST LIST_AMBIGUOUS ALWAYS_LAST_PROMPT AUTO_MENU

My Opinion:
I have most of these set in my global zshrc, but one I don't support as a
default option is NO_HUP.  If people know enough to want it, fine - but for
the average user I don't believe it should be automatically enabled.
If people exit/hang up, their programs should get a HUP signal.  That's
the whole point of the system.  If they want to keep things around, they
should use disown (like me) or set NO_HUP themselves.
