No, your patch is absolutely correct and does the Right Thing.  It was me
who introduced this bug.  Shiftchars used to copy line[ll] but I changed
it because a memory debugger tool noticed that it is reading
uninitialised memory (although that was not a real bug in that case).
When shiftchars is called from zle_tricky.c, the line should be null
terminated.  For some reason this change did not go to the ChangeLog,
although it is entered in the zle_utils.c RCS log (ChangeLog is
automatically generated from the RCS logs).  I was quite puzzled looking
at the ChangeLog and not seeing anything which can cause this bug.

Thanks,

Zoltan
