Thanks, VZ.  I guess I didn't realize the significance of your post the
first time I saw it.  Per your message and Peter's, this did the trick
to expand the completed filenames:

   $ zle -C all-matches complete-word _generic
   $ bindkey '^Xa' all-matches
   $ zstyle ':completion:all-matches:*' completer _all_matches _complete
   $ zstyle ':completion:all-matches:*' insert true
