Hi,

As I reported a few days ago, when completing pids with the style
setting insert-ids=single, it is not possible to enter menu completion
via the menu-complete/menu-select key bindings.  This patch fixes this
specific problem, though I cannot claim to understand all the values
that $compstate[insert] can take on well enough to know that there are
not other desirable state transitions still being prevented by this
style setting.

thanks,
Greg
