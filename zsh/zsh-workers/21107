Okay, so we need to find out if iconv.h comes from libiconv. That's
probably easiest done by checking whether it defines _LIBICONV_H or
_LIBICONV_VERSION using AC_CHECK_DECL. The following patch does that.

If testing this on a suitable Solaris installation (with libiconv and
gcc), note that you'll need LD_LIBRARY_PATH to contain /usr/local/lib.
(otherwise the later tcsetpgrp() test fails to run because it needs to
find the libiconv library). Should I perhaps use a separate ICONV_LIBS
variable?
