That's not very helpful.  "man 2 stat" might be better, but not much.  On
my system, neither of them explains what a time_t represents.

The stored accuracy of file time stamps varies by operating system
implementation.  For practical shell programming purposes, though, it
has one-second granularity.  Modern computers can create or modify a
lot of files in one second.

} I think you're right but i'm not an expert.

Even if you're somehow prevented from writing more than one file per
second, there are a LOT of ways two files could get the same stamp.
Just a few I can think of immediately:
 - hard-link a file to a second name with "ln"
 - copy a file with "cp -a" or "tar" etc.
 - set the system clock back (e.g., ntpd adjusting for drift)
