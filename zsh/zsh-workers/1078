Hi!

I just built zsh 2.6p17 on several platforms, and only found one
small glitch: If the binary is stripped on OSF/1 V3.2, it dumps
core immediately.  A note about this in the Etc/MACHINES file
would be nice.

Thanks.

P.S.
When I started working at my current job, everybody used bash.
Now, after I've told them about all fun things that is possible
with zsh, they are about to make zsh the standard shell instead.  :)
D.S.
