This list is the only one I'm subscribed to that has gotten flooded
with these Sobig viruses, and I don't think any of them require
subscription to post.  I don't know if that means the other lists have
virus filters, or that they just aren't popular enough to be in many
Outlook users' mailboxes :)

Putting even TMDA on a help list is going to discourage people from
posting.
