This can only happen if NCURSES_VERSION but you do not link zsh with
ncurses or if your ncurses behaves differently than mine.  I use 1.9.8a
and it the tgetflags function there returns 1 if a boolean capability is
on, 0 if it is off and -1 if there is no boolean capability with that
name.  We can add checks for older ncurses'es if necessary.
