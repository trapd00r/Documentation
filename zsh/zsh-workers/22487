Unfortunately I'm not a signal expert and it really needs someone who
does this sort of thing regularly.

The pause() looks a bit fishy.  There are two explicit occurrences in
the code:  I'll assume it's one of these for now.  What strace
reports might be only distantly related to the source code; still, my
Fedora Core 4 with 2.6.14 says it's calling rt_sigsuspend(), which
sounds much more plausible.

One call is here:

#ifdef BROKEN_POSIX_SIGSUSPEND
    sigprocmask(SIG_SETMASK, &set, &oset);
    pause();
    sigprocmask(SIG_SETMASK, &oset, NULL);
#else /* not BROKEN_POSIX_SIGSUSPEND */
    ret = sigsuspend(&set);
#endif /* BROKEN_POSIX_SIGSUSPEND */

and the other is right down at the tail end where we're virtually
implementing signal suspension from scratch.

I don't think you should be getting either of those... certainly not the
second, but probably not BROKEN_POSIX_SIGSUSPEND either.  Could you
check if that's defined?  If it is, try undefining it; the test may need
tweaking.
