} Why's that?  I'm still not fully understanding this, it seems.

The default for _files with no options and no file-patterns styles is to
use the all-files tag (this is determined by the setting of `type' in
_files if you want to follow it).

If you give file-patterns for any of globbed-files, directories or
all-files, then (`type' gets changed, so) different tags are used.  If
the only file-patterns you give are for directories, then the tags used
are directories and all-files.

To get globbed-files used, you either have to specify file-patterns for
it, or else the caller of _files has to pass -g.
