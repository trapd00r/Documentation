Unfortunately, bs really is sending ^@ in screen and I cannot change it.
stty erase '^H' or '^?' doesn't change bs at all. It's as if the key
mapping at a lower level is screwed up.

I added a bindkey "^@" "backward-delete-char" in my zshrc when TERM =
screen and I can hit bs and it works in zsh proper. If I run vim though,
my editor of choice, the bs key just throws me out of edit mode instead
of deleting the previous char.
