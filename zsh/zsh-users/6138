Hi,

I'm thinking of writing an extension to zsh that makes aliases work with sudo.

For example, I have an alias agi="apt-get install", since this needs root I 
often find myself typing "sudo agi foo", which of course doesn't work.

If someone has already done this or has suggestions for an implementation, 
please reply :)

-Eric
