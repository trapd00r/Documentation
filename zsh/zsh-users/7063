    Hi Peter :)

    Yes :( I should have remembered this... A very intelligent, easy
an elegant solution. Thanks a lot for the help :))

    And its logical: I should have took a look at the completion
code, since it processes a lot of files. I just didn't thought of it,
sorry for the noise :((

    Anyway I'm still stunned by the first example I put, the
assignment to the array in the form array=($array $newitem) Why Zsh
quotes correctly? (I should define 'correctly' as 'the way I
wanted'...).

    Again, thanks for your answer :)
