} I think that's because config.modules.sh doesn't get rerun

} probably depend on it somewhere.  I wonder if the following fixes it or
} simply introduces some dependency loop... 

Seems to be OK (no loop) on Linux.  After applying the patch, "make"
rebuilds config.modules, all the Makefiles, and then init.o and relinks.
A subsquent "make" does all the stamp-modobjs.tmp steps but does not
rebuild anything.

I didn't try a from-scratch build, though.
