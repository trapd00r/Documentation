In which way does it not work?

Would you have a file whose name starts with "-" in the current
directory and a GNU grep by any chance?

In any case, when passing /unknown/ arguments (practically, if
you can't make sure none of them may start with a - or +), you
need to mark the end of options:

grep foo -- *(.)
