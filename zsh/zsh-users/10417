Kudos for this astonishing piece of software :) I like it. It is not a
thing I would use as my regular IRC client, but it's fun using it.

My wishlist:

- completion for nick names
- some kind of recode support? (my system uses UTF-8, but I want to use
  iso-8859-1 for my IRC messages)
- triggers? (I'm being stupid, I know :))

On the one hand it is annoying to escape shell meta characters, on the

messages...

noglob helps a little bit, but most annoying are smilies ;)
