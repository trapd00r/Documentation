Okay, what about the following behavior:

 - keep the second patch (will fail if ran from cron or any other
   situation where there is no ctty)

 - add a --with-working-tcsetpgrp / --without-working-tcsetpgrp switch
   to force configure to skip the test (instead of failing) and assume
   a working / non-working tcsetpgrp

Would that satisfy everyone?

Phil.
