Sort of, but currently (4.3.10) not very usefully.  The zshzle manual
gives a description of region_highlight that allows certain tricks of
this sort, but at the moment you have to do a lot of work yourself with
shell widgets to apply it.  Also, highlighting doesn't move dynamically
when the text is edited.  Until someone has much more time to spend on
this it's mostly useful for static effects (for example, as in the
read-from-minibuffer widget).
