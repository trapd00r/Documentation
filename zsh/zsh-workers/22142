About Solaris again. As I said, in the login shell (e.g., after doing 
ssh to the Solaris machine), insert-compose-character doesn't work. But, 
if I start another shell, even using 'exec - zsh', which  should really  
start another login shell, it starts working!  Diffing the environment 
(obtain from 'set') between the two shells, nothing suspicious is shown:

~$ set >/tmp/a         
~$ exec - zsh 
~$ set >/tmp/b         
~$ diff -a /tmp/[ab]

This really makes no sense!

Best,

PS. On Solaris, insert-compose-character still doesn't work for me.
