Hm yeah. But I think it would be way more convenient to let the shell do
that automatically, since at least here `reply' is supposed to be used.

I guess, you've seen the patch I set for "c)". That was easy enough.
You're probably right that this should always apply to `reply', `REPLY'
and the like. I don't know how to do that, though. Would you always have
such parameters be available globally, even after an `unset'?

Any ideas where to apply the leverage?
