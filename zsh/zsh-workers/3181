The defaults have changed in zsh-3.1.1, the LIST_AMBIGUOUS option is on by
default.  Several other options are set now by default (see the Dec 27 1997
entry in the ChangeLog).  This should make zsh more user friendly when
invoked without without any startup files.  Many people symply do not know
about most of the zsh options.  Just add unset LIST_AMBIGUOUS into your
.zshrc.
