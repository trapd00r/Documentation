The OpenBSD ports collection has just changed the list of sites
specified for retrieving of zsh source, with this log-message:

-----------------------------< cut here >-------------------------------
ftp.zsh.org and www.zsh.org looks like they are limiting the bandwidth to
10K/s.  So, I decided to re-order the list of MASTER_SITES to use a faster
site as the first one used (ftp://ftp.fu-berlin.de/pub/unix/shells/zsh/).
-----------------------------< cut here >-------------------------------

Is it true that the sites are being bandwidth-limited?
Are more mirrors desired?
I can definitely arrange an NL mirror, perhaps a UK one.
