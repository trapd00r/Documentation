I hope that whoever can take that decision, chooses to change the list
to sources.redhat.com. I'm subscribed to another sources.redhat.com mailing
lists and always received almost zero spam.

And while that happens, the virus is still flooding the lists and nobody
does nothing :(

Thanks for the offer anyway ;)
