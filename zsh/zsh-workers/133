This is changed in beta10.  USERNAME always comes from pswd->pw_name
now.  Also USERNAME is now magical so that if you are root, executing

USERNAME=username

will change the username and uid the shell is executing under.  Also,
as root, you can execute command under other usernames/uid by

USERNAME=nobody command.

I'm putting the finishing touches on beta10.  There have been a lot of
internal changes and code reorganization.
