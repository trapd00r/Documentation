:Perhaps what you mean is that we should wait for our parent to put us in
:our own process group before attempting to make that group the tty group?

Yes, though the whole thing reeks anyway.  Your patch does a more appropriate
job, though in normal operation one is going to expect the parent to set
the pgrp appropriately before execing the child, thus all these 
GETPGRP() calls may be somewhat excessive - I haven't thought through all
the possible permutations yet (not to mention broken systems) so I think
I'll stay with your patch for now.
