>From the manual:

   Globbing Flags
       There are various flags which affect  any  text  to  their
       right  up  to the end of the enclosing group or to the end
       of the pattern; they require the EXTENDED_GLOB option. All
       take  the  form (#X) where X may have one of the following
       forms:

       i      Case insensitive:  upper or lower  case  characters
              in  the  pattern  match upper or lower case charac­
              ters.

Can't see any reason why the above wouldn't work...  I've tried
it in zsh 3.1.9 and 4.0.2.

Thanks,

Steve
