Subject: zargs doesn't work reliably
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8; format=flowed
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Content-Disposition: inline

Usage: zargs [options --] [input-args] [-- command [initial-args]]

% touch -- -- -+
% zargs -- * -- ls -d
(eval):2: command not found: -+
% zargs * -- ls -d
ls: invalid option -- +
Try `ls --help' for more information.
% zargs * ls -d
-+ ls -d

since input-args is the only part you do not control, it should come
last, like so
Usage: zargs [options --] [command [initial-args]] -- [input-args]
A problem is how to give -- as initial-args then, maybe someone less
tired can come up with something?
