Probably allowing it with both would be better, since `history' is a more
natural command.

Looks essentially OK to me as it is, it can be enhanced later if we feel
like it.

I think we'll need to be on the watch for conditions caused by errors
--- e.g. an error in popping due to problems with the temporary history
failing to restore the permanent history even though that's OK.  That
just needs some ad hoc testing.
