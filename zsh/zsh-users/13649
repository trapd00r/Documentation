The dollar is part of a Zsh quoting mechanism. From man zshall:

A string enclosed between ‘$'’ and ‘'’ is processed the same way as the 
string arguments of the print builtin, and the resulting string is 
considered to be entirely quoted.  A literal ‘'’ character can be included 
in the string by using the ‘\'’ escape.


I'd be surprised if:

IFS=' \t\n'

did what you want it to. E.g.


## set up a test variable
$ R=$(print "sep arated\nnewline\nby\ta\ttab")
$ print -R $R
sep arated
newline
by      a       tab

## with IFS and no dollar-quoting -- note that it splits on 't's and 'n's
$ IFS=' \t\n'
$ TABS=( ${=R} ) ; print -l $TABS
sep
ara
ed

ewli
e
by      a
ab

## with dollar-quoting
$ IFS=$' \t\n'
$ TABS=( ${=R} ) ; print -l $TABS
sep
arated
newline
by
a
tab
