Well, I was hoping some miracle cure was going to come along and  
cure the slowness in zsh under NeXTStep 3.2.

It compiled fine, only complaining about a lack of 'makeinfo' when  
I did 'make install' and it claimed that there was nothing to be  
done for 'make all'

The drawing of the prompt (right and left) is still terribly slow,  
and if I go into a long command (ie a find command) and type, I can  
see the cursor jump to the beginning of the line and then back  
again.

Anyone have any clues what could be causing this?  I've tried to  
play with the BAUD settings, to no avail.
