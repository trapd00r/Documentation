Cleaner?  Like I said, the baseline behavior should be what happens when
all the options are unset.  The cleanest output is none at all.

} I also find that the testing of options is a little clearer in
} general, in the code.  (The option patch actually normalised all option

} I do prefer unset(UNSET) to isset(NOUNSET).

There's nothing that requires us to use NOUNSET in the code.  You yourself
used EXECOPT instead of EXEC, for example (and for obvious reasons).

} It does.

"setopt nohup" parallels it, but the output of "setopt" doesn't say "nohup".

} 
} True, that's how the options used to work, but what is the "expected
} behaviour"?  It varies depending on whether we're emulating sh, ksh,
} csh, zsh, (when we get round to it) POSIX, or whatever.

The "expected behavior" is what you get when you run "./zsh" out of
the build directory on a machine that's never had zsh near it before.

Emulations are just that; they're by definition not baseline behavior
(unless what you're writing is nothing more than an emulator).

] Not to mention
} that not even all the non-special options defaulted to off anyway

The only ones that didn't are FUNCTION_ARGZERO, which is new; BG_NICE,
which has always annoyed me anyway (and which originally didn't default
that way, if I recall correctly); and the three HASH options, which
don't change any user-visible behavior, only performance tradeoffs.
