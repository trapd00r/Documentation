     delete readonly (S)
          This parameter allows readonly files to be deleted. This is not
          normal DOS semantics, but is allowed by UNIX.

          This option may be useful for running applications such as rcs,
          where UNIX file ownership prevents changing file permissions, and
          DOS semantics prevent deletion of a read only file.

          Default: delete readonly = no

In general it is very bad idea to run tests on mounted directory even if it
is mounted off NT server. SAMBA complicates things even more.
