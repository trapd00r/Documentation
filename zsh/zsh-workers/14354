} Now the leading quote has been removed, but the trailing quote is there.
} (They used to both disappear.)

Just to be clear ... both of them disappearing is wrong too, of course.

Why is it ever correct to delete quotes _anywhere_?

Here's an even worse error:

schaefer<510> echo '${(@M)${(f)$(<=(print -l *))}:#*conf*}'<C-x g>
schaefer<510> echo ${(@M)${(f)$(<=(print -l *))}:#*conf*}

Now both *single* quotes are gone.  Bad news.
