Ah, sorry, it appears that I misremebered POSIX, and it's actually ksh
that's got it wrong.  POSIX.2 clase 3.7.2: "Output redirection using the >
format shall fail if the noclobber option is set ... and the file named
... exists and is a regular file.".  So don't use that patch; I'll send
a better one tomorrow.
