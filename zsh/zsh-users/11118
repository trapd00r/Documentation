I have the following problem. I crashed an mrxvt session 
with 8 or more shells. Now all of them are zombie

ps wax | grep  zsh  show :
 5138 tty3     Ss+    0:00 -zsh
 5269 pts/1    Ss     0:00 zsh
 5290 pts/2    Ss     0:00 zsh

17134 pts/8    S+     0:00 -zsh
17758 pts/5    Ss+    0:00 -zsh
17851 pts/14   Ss     0:00 -zsh

The question is if someone know a way to recover them.
Maybe something like in reverse of clone.
