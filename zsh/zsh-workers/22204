The internal code uses "home" without reference to the actual parameter
(in particular, whether it's actually set), so it would appear in some
places as if $HOME was set after all.  Or, to put it another way, the
catch is in the "ignore it when not in zsh emulation"---that's
significantly more complicated than not setting it in the first places
as well as being less consistent.
