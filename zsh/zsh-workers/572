With beta10 and previous releases, the following worked:

% echo $ZSH_VERSION 
2.6-beta10
% alias e="gnuclient -q"
% [[ $HOST != $HOMESYSTEM ]] && alias e="$(whence e) -h $HOMESYSTEM"
% type e
e is an alias for gnuclient -q -h spacely


Now however, the rationalized alias output makes this not work:

% echo $ZSH_VERSION
2.6-beta11
alias e="gnuclient -q"
% [[ $HOST != $HOMESYSTEM ]] && alias e="$(whence e) -h $HOMESYSTEM"
% type e
e is an alias for \''gnuclient -q'\'' -h spacely'

This is not what I desire ('gnuclient -q' is not a valid command) - what
 I want is to append "-h spacely" to the alias.  How can I do this?

Thanks in advance,
  Vin
