I don't know if this is yodl-induced because I'm using the 3.0.x sources, but
capitalization is messed up in the extended completion section:

`S[STRING] ...'
     Matches if the current word on the command line starts with one of
     the strings given in brackets.  The STRING is not removed and is
     not part of the completion.

`S[STRING] ...'
     Like S[STRING] except that the STRING is part of the completion.

Uhh, yeah ... one of those is supposed to be a lower case S.  Every pair of
upper/lower completion options has this problem, and not all of them can be
easily deduced from context like that one.
