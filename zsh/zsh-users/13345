True, thanks for the tip (although this doesn't sound optimal as xterm would still be unfixed).

Yeah, I guess this is more or less the only option; the side-effect is that one needs to move stuff from zprofile/.zprofile to zshrc/.zshrc in order to be able to override system settings (e.g., locale settings). This is perhaps bit contradicting of how many view the division between different zsh init files.

Cheers!
