Aha, an old version.  Newer versions of _path_files don't do that
anymore (and they use an utility builtin, so it won't help you to just
install the new _path_files).  I don't know if 4.0.1-pre-1 is being
distributed somewhere, if it is, you could upgrade to that, otherwise
you could wait for the next stable release.

Bye
 Sven
