At least it is generic enough to go into Base, I think.

This is nice, but a more powerful `_ports' would still be useful for
all the other commands that use port numbers (_rpm, _mount, _nslookup, 
_ssh, _yp). Sometimes looking at the command name to decide which
ports to suggest is enough, but sometimes we might want to look at
other context information (this port forwarding thing in _ssh, for
example). I don't have any ideas about all this, yet, I just thought I 
should mention it.

And while I'm at it: we still need descriptions for the new parameters 
used and the `_combination' and `_regex_arguments' functions in the
docs.

(Btw, did I already ask if someone knows of other parameters used by
the completion system that aren't documented in the config section of
compsys.yo, yet?)

Bye
 Sven
