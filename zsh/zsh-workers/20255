Assuming that a great many things will remain true, the zsh that will
"ship" with Debian 3.1 needs to be ready by the 17th.

If 4.2.1 is out by then, I imagine it will be stock 4.2.1; otherwise it
will be 4.2.0 plus plenty of patches, 4.2.1-test-A, current CVS HEAD, or
some possibility I haven't envisioned.

Anyone who cares is welcome to comment on the matter.
