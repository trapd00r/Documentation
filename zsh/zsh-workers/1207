IRIX 5.3 IP22 mips
but not on:
HP-UX A.09.01 A 9000/735 two-user license

VERSION: 2.6-beta13

>From what I understand, right now, there are only 2 vi-registers:
the unnamed register
and
the "any-alphanumeric-character-expect-for_" register

Right now if I try using the latter, on IRIX, I get a seg fault,
such as doing in vi-mode:
"ax
or:
"ay
