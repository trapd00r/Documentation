I found zsh hangup with listpacked on 80x24 terminal as follows.

Z(2):akr@flux% zsh -f
flux% stty size
24 80
flux% echo $ZSH_VERSION 
3.1.9-dev-8
flux% autoload -U compinit; compinit -D; setopt listpacked; compdef _tst tst
flux% _tst () {
function> compadd aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
function> }
flux% tst <TAB>

A shorter or longer `a's doesn't cause hangup.
