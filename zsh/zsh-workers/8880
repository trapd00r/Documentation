Hm. Isn't that a matter of personal taste? And note that the patch
keeps the default behaviour of showing/using all directories. You
have to change _sort_tags explicitly to get only one of them, and when 
you do that you probably know what you are doing.

It would probably only be irritating if you choose to try *only* the
directories in $cdpath or to try them *first*. Do you think that our
users need to be saved from this? I.e. should we change _cd to
explicitly disallow this?

The patch also makes directories in `.' be listed first... maybe
that'll help? And with menu-completion you'll get those names first,
of course. Err... one could say that the patch does the ordering you
want.
