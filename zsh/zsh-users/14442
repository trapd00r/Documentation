Hmm... seems a bit hit and miss for me.  It looks like it only completes
shares it already knows about (this is somewhere in Cygwin or Windows
rather than the shell.)  Apart from that, I thought it was working fine,
then it started hanging.  I think the basic problem is the same... it's
spending all its time uselessly stat'ing directories higher up the
hierarchy where I want them left alone.  I'd recommend setting the
accept-exact-dirs style, but I think there's something more going on that's
causing it to do things that are taking far too long.
