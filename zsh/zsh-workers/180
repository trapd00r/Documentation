This bug seems to be compiler dependent. Here is a quotion from my BUGS file:


------------------------------------------------------------------------
On ULTRIX 4.2, if NOTIFY is unset, zsh gets SEGV each time a background
job terminates if compiled with gcc-2.6.3 or c89. It does not happen
with cc (non-ANSI compiler, ansi2knr is used). Terminal suspension
does not seem work regardless of the compiler. HP-UX seems to have
similar problems.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

And with gcc 2.6.3 on ultrix 4.2 ^Z does not work. The job won'n continue
after ^Z but the shell also hangs.

Bye,
  Zoltan
