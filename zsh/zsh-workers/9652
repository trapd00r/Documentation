I'm afraid, that simply matching pattern is not enough. What's wrong with
creating directory foo@@ outside of ClearCase tree?

There is at least one more similar case - Legato Networker can export save
indexes as file system. So, if you access /save/foo/bar you will get the
latest saved version, but if you access /save/foo/bar@01.01.2000 (do not
remember exact syntax) you will get version from the January, 1st. The way
it works is much like automounter.

It means, that we must specify "pattern on files that reside on specific
filesystem". Only there are these patterns special.

How ClearCase exports it's source tree? I think, it should be something like
NFS or automounters as well.
