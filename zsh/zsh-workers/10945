That's OK, zsh-users goes to zsh-workers.  But you don't need to be on the
zsh-workers list to send mail to it.

I've just reproduced this as far back as 3.1.6-dev-20.  I don't have any
older builds around any more.  Glancing through the ChangeLog, I think that
makes zsh-workers/10103 the most likely culprit, though I don't see how.
