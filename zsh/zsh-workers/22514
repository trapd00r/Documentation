Hi guys,

something I just noticed (zsh 4.3.2 and 4.3.2-dev1 from debian
unstable) and looks like a bug to me:

~$ a() [[ a = a ]]
zsh: parse error near `\n'
(1)~$ a() [[ a = a ]]
zsh: parse error near `\n'
(1)~$ a() [[ a = a ]]
zsh: parse error near `\n'
(1)~$ print -P %_
function function function
(1)~$ '
function function function quote>

Same goes for:

odd() (( $1 % 2 ))
