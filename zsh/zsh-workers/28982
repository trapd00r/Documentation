Subject: menu-select interactive mode
From: Mikael Magnusson <mikachu@gmail.com>

We were talking on irc about this, and I couldn't get it to work.
Turns out if you just set
zstyle ':completion:*' menu interactive
and invoke the menu-select widget, nothing happens. What you have to
do is either
zstyle ':completion:*' menu select interactive
but then you always get menu selection which you might not want (I
don't), so I ended up with this instead
zle -C menu-select-interactive menu-complete _generic
zstyle ':completion:menu-select-interactive:*' menu select interactive
bindkey "^[m"  menu-select-interactive

(^[m was previously set to menu-select)

Is this intended or a bug? The _main_complete code leading up to
setting MENUMODE isn't very obvious to me.
