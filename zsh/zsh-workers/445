Ok this is the third time I sent this.  Just want to make sure
it gets into either beta11 or hzoli11.

The bug was introduced between beta8 and beta9.  WATCHFMTs now ignore bold, 
underline etc...  

test9: zle_misc.c line 700
test9-hzoli11: zle_misc.c line 757

	       tputs(tcstr[cap], 1, putshout);
should be
	       tputs(tcstr[cap], 1, putraw);

Since it is ONLY ONE LINE, can you PRETTY PLEASE WITH SUGAR ON IT put
it into one of the version.  Thanks!!!
