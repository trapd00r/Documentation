I knew about periodic(), but rereading my mail, I should have asked
differently. Let me retry :)

What, if any, is the canonical way to parse information from a file
and putting that into variables. Normally, I would just create a bunch
of functions, but ZSH has surprised me too often by providing things
and mechanisms I never thought of, so I wanted to check if there
are any hidden goodies.


Sorry for the confusion,
Richard

PS: Mental note: Cleanly seperate what I know and what I want to
know when asking questions. Do not ask about the whole concept,
only ask about the missing pieces.
