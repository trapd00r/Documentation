The word ``matches'' in manual may be a bit misleading but I fail to suggest
better. We actually mean ``completion listing'' that completion code
internally builds. In case of _correct/_approximate or _expand it is actually
superset of possible matches (original word on line or all expansions).

Actually, it just occured to me, that exactly in case of _correct or
_approximate this distinction may be significant. User _may_ want to add all
*matches* but without original string. But this probably needs more user
feedback.
