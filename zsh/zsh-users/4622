sorry - i misunderstood. i'm sure someone on the list will know better
(and i'll see if i can figure it out), but you might read the howto here
as well:

http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-z.html?dwzone=linux

i'm pretty sure it's just a matter of quoting the escape codes correctly
for zsh.

looking through the examples of others is still a good idea since plenty
of people have similar things in their prompts.

i also think you should switch the $TOPBAR thing to going through precmd
- i think it will simplify your life a lot.
