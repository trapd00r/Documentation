} Reading the documentation and the code didn't help.

I'm glad I'm not the only one to think that.

} There are a few problems.  I couldn't work out how to add separators
} other than space to a command added from within a regex argument
} specifier.  It should have been possible to use _values -s, but for some
} reason that didn't work.

I seem to recall some other places where _values doesn't work correctly.
Maybe something related to the recursion problem mentioned in the thread
spawned by zsh-workers/20618?
