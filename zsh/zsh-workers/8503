Subject: Tanaka's cvs-pserver zsh source
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

I was having trouble compiling after the last round of patches, so I grabbed
a copy from Tanaka's server for comparison.  Misc. remarks about the source
from that server:

Completion/Builtins/_popd has two entire, different, implementations of the
function, one after the other.  The second one is the one I have, and looks
like the correct one, but I don't recall having seen the other so I can't be
sure.

Completion/User/_man doesn't have Oliver's patch from 8139.

Completion/X/_xrdb is missing.

Doc/Zsh/compsys.yo lacks history_list and history_remove_all_dups from 8063.

Functions/Prompts/promptinit is from 8337, not 8353, but:
Functions/Prompts/prompt_oliver_setup includes 8363, which needs 8353.

META-FAQ is an empty file.

Src/Modules/mathfunc.c lacks 8138.

The crucial bit missing from all Sven's patches I'd applied, and which was
breaking my build, but which Tanaka *does* have, is:
