I'm missing something, since if you start up a shell interactively it
should try to load zle, shouldn't it?

However, it's perfectly possible that there's a remaining unwanted
effect of the simplification to the interface to zle I put in.  If you
can work out where you think it shouldn't be trying to load zle but is,
I'll fix it (probably not before the weekend).
