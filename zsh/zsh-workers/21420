Zsh is an amazing shell. I've used Zsh for years as my primary shell, and i=
t
has treated me well.

With one problem.

Defaults. Or lack thereof. It is easy to claim that zsh is so customizable =
that
there cannot possibly be any set of defaults that will satisfy everyone. An=
d
they would be correct. But it is incorrect to say that there cannot be a
default configuration that is superior to the current default, most of the
time, for the vast majority of people.

Ideas:

 * Make completions Just Work(TM) out of the box. I suggest common commands
   such as 'xpdf' or 'acroread' should complete only .pdf files, or tar onl=
y
   completing .gz or .bz2.

 * When completing commands, list them with one line help summaries from ma=
n
   pages, like the Friendly Interactive SHell does (fish).

 * Add colors or at least boldface to the default prompt. The reasoning beh=
ind
   this is straightforward--it seperates command output. It is very difficu=
lt
   to tell where the output of one grep finishes and the other starts witho=
ut a
   colored prompt.

   The default prompt:
   howl%

   is not very useful.

   Something as straightforward as
   keir@howl:~/music %

   is much better, especially when it is in bold or colored.

 * Extremely controversial: make a 'extract' command that intelligently
   handles all sorts of file formats. There is one argument, that says it i=
s
   not zsh's place to do this. There is another, that says this is somethin=
g
   zsh could do trivially, is very common, exists in virtually everyone's
   .zshrc in one form or another, and could be done once, properly, for the
   last time, upstream.=20

 * Extremely controversial: A set of default aliases.

   For example, everyone I know who uses zsh has 'll' bound to ls -l.  I
   suggest adding single letter aliases, 'l' for 'ls', 'p' for ps, or 'e' f=
or
   edit (which invokes $EDITOR). There are many possibilities. What I am
   suggesting is to take action, make a decision, and make a useful set of
   default aliases.

   That's right, I'm suggesting taking a stand, and adding useful functiona=
lity
   to zsh that works out of the box.=20

 * A good intro doc on using zsh interacitvely that goes over things it doe=
s
   differently from other shells, such as good completion or the above defa=
ult
   aliases. The intro on the zsh website is ok, but it could use some work.

I have other ideas, but the main purpose of this email is to get a feel for
what the zsh developer community thinks about improving the default usabili=
ty
of zsh.

It is important to note that I am *not* suggesting removing anything from z=
sh,
or removing any of the customizability-- only that great defaults would mak=
e
zsh more popular, more usable, and just plain better (for those who don't w=
ant
to spend hours tweaking their shell).

Good defaults benefit power users too, who no longer have to write their ow=
n
extract function, or add their own aliases for ls, ps, or whatever.

Thoughts?

Thanks,
Keir
