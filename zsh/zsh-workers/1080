Could you debug this a little bit more?  Please compile zsh with exactly
the same options as before, but add -g to CFLAGS and LDFLAGS.  Then strip
the result, but also keep an unstripped version.  Enable core dumps and
start the stripped version.  When it dumps a core use

gdb zsh.unstripped core

to examine it.  Send me a backtrace.

You may also try to configue zsh with

./configure --enable-zsh-mem --enable-zsh-mem-warning --enable-zsh-mem-debug --enable-zsh-debug --enable-zsh-secure-free

And run it this way.  It may give some warnings.

Also you may check if zsh also coredumps if invoked with -f.  If not try to
locate the line in the startup files which causes the dump.  Try to
minimize the number of commands executed before this line.

Thanks,

Zoltan
