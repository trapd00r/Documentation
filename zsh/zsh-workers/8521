Trying to compile on a somewhat antic system, I got following errors:

Undefined                       first referenced
 symbol                             in file
log1p                               Modules/mathfunc.o
drem                                Modules/mathfunc.o
expm1                               Modules/mathfunc.o
ilogb                               Modules/mathfunc.o

(I added mathfunc to the list of modules). It compiles O.K. on another system.
Still, out of these, drem() is missing on SUSV2 page.

Should I add test for them to configure? Or anybody has better idea? It may
result in a case, when different versions will support different set of
functions. Not really nice.
