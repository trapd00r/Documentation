Then you can set $SHELL to user-zsh in .zprofile and use the
same trick as I was suggesting (that is source .zshrc in .zshenv
if $0 is user-zsh). Won't work for ssh though.

That's the kind of trick you use when you want to use zsh on
systems where zsh is not installed system-wide or where you're
not allowed to change your login shell (
# ~/.profile simplified
SHELL=~/bin/user-zsh
export SHELL
exec "$SHELL"
)
