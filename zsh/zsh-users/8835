That's because within an arithmentic context, 0 is false and 1 is true,
so the following are equivalent:

true && echo true
(( 1 )) && echo true
(( 2 > 1 )) && echo true   # since $(( 2 > 1 )) evaluates to 1

An assignment expression evaluates to the value of the variable, so 
(( a=0 )) is the same as (( 0 )) .
