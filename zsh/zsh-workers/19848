I tested this under /bin/sh on FreeBSD and it also behaves the same as
bash and the others.  Even though, unless I am missing something here,
zsh seems to have the most appropriate behavior.  I don't quite
understand why the others don't immediately process the signal.  As
long as you are not blocking the signal I would expect it to print the
'echo USR1 fired' message as soon as it receives the signal whether it
is in the middle of a sleep or any other command.
