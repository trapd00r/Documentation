pws-5 runs fine here on my (outdated) IRIX6.2 box. (I am upgrading to 6.5 in two
weeks)

I still have to apply the old patch by Kristian Gjøsteen

which adds the following two lines at the end of function inittyptab in utils.c
typtab[0] = 4640;
typtab[32] = 10284;

which overwrites a previous setting.
Is this a bug in IRIX6.2 (then I'll wait until 6.5) or is it a lack
of configuration?

The same question applies to the following misconfigures:

I have to change config.h (as ever)

#define RLIM_T_IS_QUAD_T 1
to
#undef  RLIM_T_IS_QUAD_T

and

#undef  RLIM_T_IS_UNSIGNED
to
#define RLIM_T_IS_UNSIGNED 1


and I have to add
#define GETPGRP_VOID 1
#define DYNAMIC 1


Thanks,
Helmut.
