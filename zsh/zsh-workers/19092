    Hi Oliver :)

    OK, thanks :) BTW, the special parameters as 'words' and the
like, are too created and initialized by compinit (I mean, the new
completion system...)? $words doesn't seem to work, so I'm thinking
about using 'BUFFER' for command line parsing in order to call one of
the completion functions I need. Like _main_complete, but lots
simpler.

    I take note, thanks :))) Anyway I was asking just for avoiding
explicit calls to 'compdef', but I noticed that compdef is just a
function defined by compinit!, so I cannot use it. No problem anyway.
