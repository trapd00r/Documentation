Please keep us posted on how far you get with this ... some software I
have is practically begging to be turned into a zsh module, but I have
not yet managed to get the two configure scripts to play together.

zsh.mdh isn't so bad, but config.h should be reduced to the parts that
are directly involved in module linking -- or better yet, there should
be a fragment of aczsh.m4 that could be incorporated into third-party
configure scripts.
