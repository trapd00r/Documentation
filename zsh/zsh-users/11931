Oops,

sorry, end of options goes after the options and before the
remaining arguments obviously.

grep -- foo *(.)

standard greps don't recognise options after the first
non-option argument, so

grep foo *(.)

would be OK. But GNU grep (unless called in POSIX mode, as GNU
utilities in general) has the problem.
