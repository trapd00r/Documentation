My patch does set PWD and OLDPWD on startup.  The standard allows that
but does not require it.  Why do you think that PWD is better be a
special parameter?  Scripts do set PWD and if we want to allow people to
use zsh as /bin/sh then we have to allow them to write PWD.  That was my
main reason for the patch, not the standard, since I link /bin/sh to zsh.
If PWD is special, assignments will write directly to the internal pwd
variable which can cause unexpected shell behavior.  That's why PWD was
read-only.  Alternatively, you can just ignore assignments to PWD without
giving an error message, but that's a bad solution.

As long as you do not try to assign PWD, my patch does not change zsh's
behavior, other than exporting OLDPWD which was not exported before.
