Ok, when I enter 'grep 本 A<TAB>' (with the kanji character), it gives
me 2 lines:
$ grep 本 A8
A<cursor ends up here>

However, without a kanji character it prints the following 3 lines:
$ grep x A8
  grep x A<cursor is now here>
A1  A2


(Again, that's in a directory containing only the two files A1 A2.)

If the $CURSOR variable is supposed to count characters and not bytes,
it looks like it's doing that correctly, as it shows 8 in both cases.

Regards,
Christoph
