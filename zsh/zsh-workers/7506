I will be involved in project with Solaris 7 on x86 and would like to have my
favorite shell there.

I have so far no knowledge about Solaris (and, in any case, this one won't have
a compiler) so I am looking for anybody hosting binaries. BTW would be quite a
nice idea to have binaries for most common systems on ftp.zsh.org

TIA
