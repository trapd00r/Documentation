You could make the security argument since it's like having '.' at the front
of your path. If there was some bug found that would let a user change the
inode data of a file but not overwrite the file they could remove execute bits
to something like ls and put their own somewhere else.

I know that's far fetched but it might be nice to make it an option if it's not
that difficult.
