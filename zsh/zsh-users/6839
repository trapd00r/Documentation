Congratulations, you win a no-prize for accurate guessing.

} But can clever zsh be configued to avoid this behaviour.

You could always use a wrapper like this:

	function cd {
	    local -a dirs
	    dirs=( "${^@}"(-/N) )
	    if (( $#dirs == 1 ))
	    then builtin cd $dirs
	    else builtin cd "$@"
	    fi
	}

However, that might sometimes foil use of the two-argument form of "cd".
