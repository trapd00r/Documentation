The longer version I sent about an hour ago does (once you correct the
last line as I quickly found).  It tests each element of the input array
and decides if it is a file or not (i.e., is an argument).  Then if that
element of the array is in the $PWD, it appends your fix, otherwise it
leaves it alone.
