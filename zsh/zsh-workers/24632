Hi,

I wanted to add a dir to the directory hash with hash -d, so I started typing
hash -d foo=~jo<tab>
and expected it to complete to foo=~johndoe, but instead it just says
"unknown user jo". If i actually type out ~johndoe manually and press
tab, it changes to "no match for: `hash', `directories', or
`corrections'". After I add a / it properly completes directories in
johndoe's home directory though.
(It doesn't matter if it's a real user home dir or a previously named dir.)
With just zsh -f, compinit, zstyle warnings blabla, i just get the
latter message for ~anything, both if it should complete and not, and
for completed names.
