Only that it always disables auto-suffix-removal.  E.g., if $LBUFFER ends 
in a slash which was added as a completion suffix, and the first character 
of the word to be inserted is also a slash, then normally the suffix would 
be deleted in order that the slash not become doubled; but with the work- 
around, you get the double slash.
