I think you're right and we might just as well bite the bullet now.
Possibly what we lose by making a few people use --disable-largefile
instead of --disable-lfs we gain by being compatible with other
autoconf-based systems.

 Since 4.2:
 
+The configuration option --enable-lfs to enable large file support has
+been replaced by autoconf's standard --enable-largefile mechanism.
+As this is usually used whenever necessary, this won't usually
+be noticeable; however, anyone configuring with --disable-lfs
+should configure with --disable-largefile instead.
+
 The configuration option --with-curses-terminfo has been replaced
 by the option --with-term-lib="LIBS" where LIBS is a space-separated
 list of libraries to search for termcap and curses features.
