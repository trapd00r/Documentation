Let me jump back a bit and point out that it's not really correct to say
that _use_lo is a "utility" -- _arguments is the utility, and _use_lo
calls it; nobody would call _use_lo from some other function.

So I think _use_lo actually belongs in Unix/Command/, where the convention
is to use names that describe the command for which the function completes,
rather than names that describe what the function completes, or how.

Hence I think _use_lo should move to Unix/Command/_gnu_generic ...  I'd
say _gnu_style, except for other "style" connotations.

} If we remove the second level on installation, this should be a
} first-level directory like X, though.  And there's even stuff to fill
} a Network/Type directory.

This is OK, but ...

} Yes, similar foe Network if it's a first level directory.  There are
} network commands that need X and ones that don't.

I'd put anything that actually needs X under X first.

The biggest problem with doing so is X programs that are nothing more
than front-ends for text-based tools, when the text one is not installed.
Presumably it does little harm to have a few completion functions for X
commands that don't exist, but if there are actually dependencies among
the completion functions, errors could result if a completion for one of
those X commands happens to be attempted.
