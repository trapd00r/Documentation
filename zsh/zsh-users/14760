Compatibility was really my only worry... congratulations if you've
puzzled out terminal application cursor / keypad modes, but I suspect
99.something % of shell users just look at what sequences a key happens
to be sending and bind their functions to that, so it wouldn't be a good
idea to tinker with those now.

(Although it's certainly arguable, it's not completely clear that a
shell's line editor is an "application" in the strict sense, the whole
distinction being a not very happy historical accident in the first
place.  The way shells evolved means that to begin with they were just
using raw input; at some point they crossed the boundary to become
something more sophisticated.  The simple application / raw distinction
doesn't really fit.)

If you're not relying on the particular O / [ key sequence you're
getting at the moment, however, as far as I know the shell code I gave
should work fine for you (obviously, do let us know if you find a
problem).

This is probably worth mentioning in the FAQ.
