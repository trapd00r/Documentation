Hi all,

unfortunately, I could not make this work, myself. Even
looking into the bible (from bash to z shell) didn't help
as it apparently does not explictly cover changing the
order of options (or I fail and missed it).
Thus, I am sending it to the list.

  apt-get -t exper<tab> install foo

works, while

  apt-get install -t exper<tab> foo
  apt-get install foo -t exper<tab>

won't expand the release, even though all three forms
are allowed. _aptitude does not show this behaviour,
but I could not transfer stuff from there to _apt.


Richard
