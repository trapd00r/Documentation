$ which compinit
compinit () {
        # undefined
        builtin autoload -XUz
}

I don't even know enough to know if that's right or not, but I will assume
that is it.

Next you need to find out how compinit is being defined to what it is.

+/cygdrive/h/.zshrc:2&gt; autoload -U compinit
+/cygdrive/h/.zshrc:3&gt; compinit -i
+compinit:70&gt; emulate -L zsh
+compinit:71&gt; setopt extendedglob
[....]

If all that seems OK, look for the compinit in your fpath:

First runable lines look like:

emulate -L zsh
setopt extendedglob

Which is what zsh is running on startup (from #2).

Except for #1, everything seems fine.  I don't know about to say anything
about the "which compinit" results, though.

That's fine so far, that just means it'll autoload the function when you
try to run it.

What we need now is to see the section of the debugging output near where
it's printing function listings you showed in your first email.
