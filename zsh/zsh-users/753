} rlogin SINIX-L -> SINIX-N shows the above problem. It is not always the
} whole output lost - sometimes I see only the first line of `ls' output;
} sometimes the `CR NL' after prompt is lost

} Do you use setopt no_flow_control?  If yes, did you try to unset it?

} thousand thanks! running with
}   `unsetopt no_flow_control'
} really helps (I havn't set it - it must be on by default). 

Did you unset this in the local shell before starting rlogin, or in the
remote shell afterwards?  (I suspect the remote one.)

} It is probably still OS bug (happens with rlogin only - telnet runs O.K.),
} but as long as workaround exists I don't care.

This begins to sound more and more familiar.  Is the stty line speed
slower on the local terminal where you started rlogin than it is on the
remote psuedo-tty?  If so, you might try forcing them to be the same to
see if that also makes the problem go away.

The rlogin processes probably want to use flow control to compensate for
the different line speeds.
