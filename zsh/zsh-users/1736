This is trivial if you only care about filenames using A..Z and a..z.
For filenames using other characters this must turn into a nightmare.
Some languages does not have a 1:1 mapping between upper and lower
case letters. One such example is the German "doube s" ß. Imagine
a language where 'z' does not have an upper case version and is
written as 'S' instead.

Set the language setting to English and create the file "Tezt".

   Filename on disk:    Tezt
   Open with:           Test (no)   Tezt (yes)   TEST (no)   TEZT (yes)

Change the language setting to the other language and try again.

   Filename on disk:    Tezt
   Open with:           Test (no)   Tezt (yes)   TEST (yes)  TEZT (what?)

Confusing? Confuzing?

How does Amiga handle this? How does MS win9[58] handle this?

Isn't it much easier to just say that upper and lower case are
distinct letters?
