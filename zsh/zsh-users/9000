    Hi all :)

    Maybe I'm asking for something impossible, or maybe I'm just dumb
enough to not see the obvious solution...

    I have a script which returns an error code, but it outputs a lot
of info, so I call it like this:

    script.install |& tee install.log

    Obviously this 'masks' the return code, but I want to see the
output even though I'm saving it to a file, so a redirection doesn't
fit me well. I can use MULTIOS, of course, but I don't want to use it
for all my commands...

    Is there any better solution than this?:

    script.install >(tee install.log) 2>&1

    Thanks a lot in advance :))
