What I find interesting on that page is:

    Our main focus since the outage was detected has been to safegaurd
    all data on the developer CVS server as well as possible. We are
    currently attempting to backup the data on the host, which is
    taking longer than we initially anticipated it would, but is a
    necessary step to fully safegaurd the host's data.

Which implies that the machine was not being backed up before the
hardware failure?
