I'd like to suggest that we go ahead and release 2.6-beta17 (with  
the two little patches) as 2.7, after at most a few days more  
testing and, if necessary, minor patching, and then go ahead with  
starting 2.8beta with the next change.

Zoltan's point that what we have here is far better and far less  
buggy than the last released version is quite correct.  I have been  
using his versions for a long time on Sunos, OSF/1, and Nextstep,  
and have found his changes stable and generally free of problems, so  
there is little cause for worry there.  Some of the patches that he  
incorporated are quite useful and I am not sure why they didn't  
make it into the mainstream release, but it is good to see them  
there now.

Regards,
 - Irving
