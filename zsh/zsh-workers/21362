I just noticed that "setopt long_list_jobs" doesn't have any effect except
for asynchronous job notifications; e.g. when a background job exits or is
signalled you get long format, but when a foreground job is stopped you do
not.

Shouldn't it also affect the output of "jobs", "bg", "fg", etc.?  There's
some room to argue that "jobs" has the -l option, but "bg" and "fg" don't.

It *does* appear to affect the output of "wait".
