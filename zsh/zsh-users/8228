I guess the problem is that _mailboxes expects mutt to have=20
"mutt -f=3D" or "mutt -f+" as context and _mutt does not allow that so,
_mailboxes never receives the context it expects.

Well, at least whenever you have corrections turned on.

[...]

IMHO, one thing that could be used to improve _mailboxes would be to use

`mutt -Q folder | cut -d=3D -f2` to set a mutt-directory variable inside
at least _mailbox_cache.

If you are wondering: Why am I not sending patches instead of comments?
Because _mailbox_cache and _mua_mailbox seem awfully complicaded to me.=20

that was it for today... peace.
Francisco
