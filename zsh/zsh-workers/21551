hi, all.

in FEATURES-file i read:
>  ls file<20->  matches file20, file30, file100, etc.

I consider that description very, very misleading as it
could suggest that only numbers divided by 10 should be
dealt with and would suggest
>  ls file<20->  matches file20, file21, file22, etc.

        greetings,
                Matthias
