I'll let you know; we should be in business in a couple of days.

Sorry, I've already fixed this another way, though I haven't posted the
patch because it's tied into a more radical Makefile simplification that
I'm still working on.  I made the configure script edit config.status

cool things.  Hopefully 3.1.3 will be out next week.
