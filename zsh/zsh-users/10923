I would like to modify the completion of cvs'
'-d' option. I created an array like so:

repositories=( :ext:user@host:/path/to/cvs
               :ext:user@anotherhost:/path/to/cvs )

When I type:
cvs -d<TAB>

I would like zsh to offer those repositories for
completion.

I tried a few things but nothing I did seemed to
override the _cvs function that comes with the
distribution.

Sorry if this is trivial...
