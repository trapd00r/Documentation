zsh doesn't perform field splitting on the RHS of scalar variable
assignments.  Try "echo $*" under equivalent circumstances.

That's doing a substitution, rather than field splitting.  Since the
effect you're asking for is actually a substitution, rather than field
splitting (since you're just joining up the fields again anyway), this
is logically the correct thing to do.

OTOH, I suspect that you *really* want to be using an array parameter.
$path is an array version of $PATH, so you don't even need to do the
splitting manually in that case.
