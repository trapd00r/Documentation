:Hmm. That sounds slightly fishy in that csh happily exports array
:variables, but then csh is bogus in so many ways.... I've managed

Not as arrays.  In fact, I can't see it doing it at all.
% csh -f
% set | fgrep "(" | cut -f1
argv
path
% env | egrep -i "^(argv|path)" | cut -f1 -d=
PATH

    but PATH is a colon separated string.  path is a space separated string
    which is pretending to be an array.  You could export it as such but it
    would be useless.  What happens when an element in the array has a space
    in it?

% set l=(a b "c d")
% foreach i ($l)
? echo $i
? end
a
b
c
d
% zsh -f
% l=(a b "c d")
% foreach i ($l); echo $i; end
a
b
c d
