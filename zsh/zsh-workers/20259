It occurs to me to wonder why the auto-suffix isn't available in a zle
variable (like BUFFER, CURSOR, etc.) so that the user-defined widget
can make it's own decisions?  If the suffix is more than one character
long, it's not sufficient to examine $LBUFFER[-1].

Another question is whether appending to LBUFFER should (already does?) 
count as an insertion for purposes of e.g. "compadd -R".
