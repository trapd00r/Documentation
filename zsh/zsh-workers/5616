Sorrysorrysorry. My fault (of course). In the last big patch I made
`compstate[matcher]' be zero when there are no match specs at all
(previously it was `one' in this case, which looked wrong). And then I 
forgot to change the test.

Bart's patch is the correct solution.

Thanks.

Sorry.

Bye
 Sven
