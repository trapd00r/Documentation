Subject: Why doesn't compconfig[correct] apply to command names?
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

The correction logic is all in the branch of _main_complete that is used
only when the context is not command.  But I'd like to have it fix up the
command names, too, so that the rest of the line uses completions for the
correct command.
