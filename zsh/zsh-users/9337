I've found a solution, but this will only work with Tiger (Mac OS X  
version 10.4.x)...

http://developer.apple.com/macosx/spotlight.html

kMDItemFSCreationDate            The date an item's file was created.

kMDItemContentCreationDate    The date an item's content was created.

The first tells you when the file was first created.  The second  
tells you when content was added to it (this is probably identical in  
most circumstances)

This is how you get to it:

$  mdls FILENAME |\
     grep "^kMDItemContentCreationDate"

kMDItemContentCreationDate      = 2005-08-20 00:47:41 -0400


     And this is how I'd get just the date:

$  mdls FILENAME |\
     awk -F" " '/kMDItemFSCreationDate/{print $3}'

  2005-08-20

If there's a more portable way to get this to work, I'd like to learn  
about it, but this will work for now.
