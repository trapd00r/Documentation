I will reiterate my offer to set up the zsh repository and mailing lists
at sources.redhat.com (aka sourceware.org) if anyone is interested.

We can offer cvs, web, ftp, and aggressively spam blocked mailing lists.

IIRC, the last time I offered this, it wasn't well received, but, what
the heck, I'm a glutton for punishment.
