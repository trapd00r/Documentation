<H1 CLASS="chapterhead">DECwriter Correspondent (LA12)</H1>
<H2>Overview</H2>
<P>Digital's DECwriter Correspondent is a plain-paper, dot-matrix teleprinter with the
communications power and the reliability that you need to reach the system and
get your job done.</P>
<P>The lightweight Correspondent, not much larger than an attach&eacute; case, is portable.
It combines the printing and forms-handling capabilities of a tabletop terminal
with the communications and versatility of a portable teleprinter.</P>
<P>The Correspondent brings your computing power to any of a variety of applications
like remote order processing, database information retrieval, and program
development.</P>
<P>There are three DECwriter Correspondent models to choose from:</P>
<UL>
<LI><EM>LA12-AB</EM> &#8211; Designed for the greatest flexibility, this model includes a 300-baud
acoustic coupler, an integral 300/1,200-baud modem that allows the terminal
to originate or answer calls to the host, and direct coupling via a telephone
connector. This model can switch between the integral modem and the acoustic
coupler by means of a simple set-up command on the keyboard. The modem in
this model lets you dial through the keyboard and even stores telephone numbers.</LI>
<LI><EM>LA12-CB</EM> &#8211; Includes all the features of the LA12-AB except the 300/1,200-baud
integral modem. Instead, the LA12-CB offers the 300-baud acoustic coupler,
which provides the user with a cost-effective means of portable communication.</LI>
<LI><EM>LA12-DB</EM> &#8211; Designed to provide the most cost-effective tabletop solution to the
user's system console needs. The LA12-DB provides the same functionality and
teleprinter capabilities as the LA12-AB, without the integral modem or the acoustic
coupler. This model is designed to interface directly to a system by using an
EIA-RS-232C-compatible connection, which is standard on all models.</LI>
</UL>
<H2>Major Features</H2>
<P>The DECwriter Correspondent's main features are:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Built-in communications options &#8211; Some models come with modems and
acoustic coupler already installed, other models allow you to add these features
as you need them.</LI>
<LI>Impact printing &#8211; Designed for use with plain paper, and multipart forms.
Plain paper is less expensive and more convenient than the thermal paper that
other portable teleprinters use.</LI>
<LI>Smart bidirectional 150 char/s printing &#8211; Allows for fast throughput, and
reduces computer connection time and telephone costs.</LI>
<LI>Variety of character sets &#8211; Choose from U.S. ASCII, multinational, and APL
character sets to meet your application needs.</LI>
<LI>Small, portable terminal with carrying case &#8211; Lets you carry it to where the
work is. The small size enables you to fit the Correspondent on a desk or under
an airline seat.</LI>
<LI>Conversational keyboard set-up &#8211; Easy to use and simple to change set-up features.</LI>
<LI>Graphics printing &#8211; Allows the integration of charts, diagrams, and graphs
anywhere you work.</LI>
</UL>
<H2>Printing Features</H2>
<H3>Print Modes</H3>
<P>The DECwriter Correspondent offers program-selectable text and graphics modes.</P>
<H4>Draft Printing</H4>
<P>The nine-wire dot-matrix printhead provides high-speed output at the rate of 150
characters per second. By using a nine-wire printhead, the LA12 prints below-the-line
descenders, such as in the letters "p", "q", and "y", as well as underlining in all
text modes. The Correspondent prints using a bidirectional technique, in which the
printhead seeks the shortest distance to the next printable character and skips rapidly
over blank spaces. This method reduces computer connection time and telephone
connection time, thus reducing costs.</P>
<H4>Graphics Printing</H4>
<P>Bit map graphics mode allows for the creation of an infinite variety of pictures and
graphs, including bar charts, logos, signatures, and unique characters. Graphics
can be integrated with text or data to emphasize points. While the DECwriter Correspondent
provides a horizontal resolution of 72 dots per inch, it also lets you select
any one of eight vertical resolutions. Check the <CITE>DECwriter Correspondent Programmer
Reference Manual</CITE> for more details.</P>
<P>A predetermined escape sequence from the host enables the LA12 to enter the
bit-map graphics mode. Microcode control of individual printhead wires makes
every dot addressable by the host and enables images to be displayed on a video terminal
to be faithfully reproduced.</P>

<H4>Paper Release Lever</H4>
<P>This lever is used to reposition or remove friction feed paper from the terminal.</P>
<H4>Bail Bar Lever</H4>
<P>The bail bar lever is used to hold paper securely against the platen during printing.</P>
<H4>Printhead Adjustment Lever</H4>
<P>The space between the printhead and the platen is controlled by this lever. It
enables adjustment of the printhead for clear printing on single or multipart forms.</P>
<H4>Ribbon Adjustment Knob</H4>
<P>The ribbon adjustment knob is used to tighten the ribbon when installing a new
ribbon cartridge.</P>
<H3>Keyboard</H3>
<P>The DECwriter Correspondent's keyboard is arranged like a standard office typewriter
and operates in a similar manner. It includes a numeric keypad for rapid
entry of numeric data. The keys are grouped into four categories: standard keys,
function keys, set-up keys, numeric keypad keys.</P>
<H4>Standard Keys</H4>
<P>The standard keys are standard typewriter keys and include CAPS LOCK and
SHIFT. In local mode or when local echo is selected, they operate the same as typewriter
keys.</P>
<P>Auto repeat allows for a key that is depressed for more than half a second to
sends its code to the computer repeatedly until the key is released. Normally, you
would just press the desired key and release it, sending the desired character to the
host computer once. All keys will auto repeat except for SETUP, VIEW/RESET,
ESC, NUM KEY MODE, HERE IS, LOC FF, BREAK, RETURN, and any key pressed
with CTRL.</P>
<P>The CAPS LOCK is a two-position locking key, similar to the LOCK key on a
standard typewriter. When it is in the down position, only the alphabetic keys generate
uppercase characters, regardless of SHIFT key position. When it is in the up position,
the alphabetic keys generate lowercase characters. The numeric, special
symbol, function, and numeric keypad keys are not affected by the CAPS LOCK key
in either position.</P>
<P>Both of the SHIFT keys cause all standard keys on the keyboard to generate
uppercase characters. The SHIFT keys do not affect the function keys or the numeric
keypad keys.</P>
<H4>Function Keys</H4>
<P>The DECwriter Correspondent features over 17 function keys. Some of these keys
and their functions are:</P>
<UL>
<LI>DATA TALK &#8211; Establishes terminal-to-computer communications through the
integral direct-connect modem.</LI>
<LI>ESC &#8211; Causes the terminal to generate the escape control character.</LI>
<LI>CTRL &#8211; Causes the terminal to generate control characters when certain control
keys on the keyboard are pressed while holding the CTRL key down.</LI>
<LI>LINE/LOCAL &#8211; Switches the terminal between on-line mode and local mode.
When the terminal is on-line, the LINE indicator is lit.</LI>
<LI>HERE IS &#8211; Sends the answerback message to the host, if the terminal is on-line
and an answerback message has been defined and stored.</LI>
<LI>BREAK &#8211; Causes the terminal to transmit a short break signal with a fixed
time duration.</LI>
<LI>BELL G &#8211; When pressed at the same time as the CTRL key, this key generates
a bell control character. It sounds the bell tone when in local mode or when local
echo has been selected.</LI>
<LI>NUM KEY MODE &#8211; Used to switch operation of the keyboard from normal
mode to numeric keypad mode. In normal mode, the numeric keypad keys function
as standard keys. In numeric keypad mode, these keys are used as calculator
keys and the standard keys are disabled.</LI>
</UL>
<H4>Numeric Keypad Keys</H4>
<P>These are built into the standard keyboard for use in performing calculator type
operations. This function is enabled through the use of the NUM KEY MODE key
described earlier. The KEYPAD indicator is on when the numeric keypad mode has
been selected. The numeric keypad cannot be activated if the terminal is in SET-UP
mode.</P>
<H4>Set-Up Keys</H4>
<P>The Set-up keys allow you to tailor your terminal's operation to your needs. The
SET-UP key itself lets you enter and exit from Set-Up mode.</P>
<P>The Set-Up keys allow you to:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Set or clear tabs.</LI>
<LI>Set the top, bottom, left, or right margins.</LI>
<LI>Set or clear margins.</LI>
<LI>Select the current paper position as the top of the form.</LI>
<LI>Position the paper and set page length.</LI>
<LI>Print the terminal status message. This status message tells you what Set-Up
features have been selected.</LI>
<LI>Recall the Set-Up features stored in the nonvolatile memory.</LI>
<LI>Store the operator-selected features in the nonvolatile memory.</LI>
</UL>

</UL>
<P>The corrective action to take for any of these situations can be found in detail in the
<CITE>DECwriter Correspondent Operator Guide</CITE>.</P>
<H2>Set-Up Features</H2>
<P>When selecting a set-up feature, you can choose between using the set-up key and
the corresponding function key or typing the appropriate sequence. This section
contains brief descriptions of some of the operator-selectable features of the
DECwriter Correspondent. These set-up features enable you to prepare the terminal
for specific applications. If you require additional information, consult the
<CITE>DECwriter Correspondent Operator Guide</CITE> or the <CITE>DECwriter Correspondent Programmer
Reference Manual</CITE>.</P>
<P>The operator-selectable features can only be changed while the terminal is in SET-UP.
The suggested sequence to change or select set-up features is:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Enter Set-Up by depressing the CTRL and SET-UP keys simultaneously.</LI>
<LI>Print a status message to check feature settings.</LI>
<LI>Change one or more of the features, such as tabs, baud rate, or character set
to the desired setting.</LI>
<LI>Store the features, if desired, in the nonvolatile memory. The terminal will
remember the stored features even if the power is turned off.</LI>
<LI>Print a second status message to check that all features are correct.</LI>
<LI>Exit Set-Up by depressing the SET-UP key.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Set-Up can be entered while in On-Line or Local mode. To prevent the loss of data,
take care to enter Set-Up only when the host is not transmitting characters.</P>

<H3>Communications Features</H3>
<P>In order for the terminal to transmit and receive data, the terminal must be compatible
with the computer and the communication system. The communication feature
selections provide you with the means for matching the terminal and the system.</P>
<P>Some of the communication features available are:</P>
<H4>Auto-Answerback</H4>
<P>This is actually a response by the terminal to a message sent from the host, so that
the terminal can be used unattended. It controls automatic transmission of the
answerback message when a communication connection is made. Your choices are
on or off.</P>
<H4>Buffer</H4>
<P>You can set the buffer size to either 256 or 1,024 characters.</P>
<H4>Communications Port</H4>
<P>Selects the communications port to be used between the terminal and the computer.</P>
<P>Standard choices vary according to the model you have, and include EIA interface,
300/1,200 b/s Direct Connect Modem (DCM) with keyboard dialing, and 300 b/s
Acoustic Coupler Modem (ACM).</P>
<P>Optional choices include 20&nbsp;mA interface and 300/1,200 b/s Direct Connect
Modem (DCM) with keyboard dialing.</P>
<H4>Local Echo</H4>
<P>When the local echo feature is chosen, every character sent to the computer is also
printed by the terminal. If local echo is off, then characters transmitted to the computer
are not printed by the terminal.</P>
<H4>Fault Action Feature</H4>
<P>This selects the action the terminal takes when a fault occurs. Selection of terminal
action depends upon the system it is being used with. Three physical faults can be
detected and acted upon.</P>
<P>When the cover is open, the Power/Fault light flashes, and printing stops. If the
printer is out of paper, the Power/Fault light flashes, and vertical paper motion
stops. When the fault is a printhead jam, the Power/Fault light flashes, and any
printing stops.</P>
<P>You can choose one of the following choices at any time: no action, send XOFF,
short break, or perform disconnect.</P>
<H4>Half-Duplex (HDX) Initial Direction</H4>
<P>When the terminal initiates communication with a computer, the HDX initial calling
direction is checked. This direction determines if the terminal starts in the
receive or transmit data state. This feature functions only when the EIA port is
selected for communication. Consult your <CITE>DECwriter Correspondent Operator
Guide</CITE> for information on using European modems.</P>
<H4>Baud Rate Operating Range Selection</H4>
<P>Lets you select either the high-speed or low-speed baud rate operating range. Individual
speeds or split speeds can be selected within each range. In some system,
transmit and receive speeds are different. The speed selection feature allows you to
adapt your terminal to all compatible systems. <STRONG>Note:</STRONG> See the <CITE>DECwriter
Correspondent Operator Guide</CITE> for more details.</P>
<P>Before choosing an individual baud rate speed, first select high-speed range,
low-speed range, or modem selection.</P>
<H4>Individual Baud Rate Speed Selection</H4>
<P>Once you have selected the high-speed or low-speed range, you can now select
individual speeds or split speeds in bits per second.</P>
<P>Individual speeds include 50, 75, 110, 134.5, 150, 200, 300, 600, 1,200, 1,800,
2,400, 4,800, 7,200, and 9,600 bits per second.</P>
<P>The split-speed choices are 75 send/600 receive, 75 send/1,200 receive, 150
send/600 receive, 150 send/1,200 receive, 300 send/2,400 receive, 300 send/4,800
receive, 600 send/2,400 receive, and 600 send/4,800 receive.</P>
<H4>Modem Protocol</H4>
<P>Modem protocol selection lets you match your system's communication protocol.
You can choose from:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Full-duplex (data lead only)</LI>
<LI>Full-duplex (full control)</LI>
<LI>Half-duplex (supervisory/EIA only)</LI>
<LI>Half-duplex (coded without reverse channel/EIA only).</LI>
</UL>
<H4>Error Override</H4>
<P>Allows the parity bit of all received characters to either be checked or ignored. This
is valuable when the received parity bit is not the same as the transmitted parity bit
or when there is no received parity bit.</P>
<H4>Parity</H4>
<P>Selects data bits per character and parity. The data bits per character can be set to 7
or 8 data bits. Parity selects the type of parity bit that the terminal generates for
transmitted characters and checks for the received character.</P>
<P>Choices include: no parity, 7 data bits with eighth bit set to mark; no parity, 7
data bits with eighth bit set to space; even parity, 7 data bits; odd parity, 7 data bits;
even parity, 8 data bits; odd parity, 8 data bits; and no parity, 8 data bits.</P>
<H4>Restraint Control</H4>
<P>Provides a signal to the computer that is should temporarily suspend data transmission
to prevent an overflow in the input buffer. With the DECwriter Correspondent
you can choose from among no restraint control, XOFF/XON for restraint control,
secondary request to send (SRTS) line for restraint control, and both XOFF/XON
and SRTS line for restraint control.</P>
<H4>Half-Duplex Turnaround Character</H4>
<P>Selects the control character that will be used to turn the line around from being
controlled by the computer to being controlled by the terminal, or vice-versa.
When the character is received, the terminal controls the communications lines,
and when the character is transmitted, the computer controls the lines.</P>
<H4>Modem Frequency Selection</H4>
<P>Allows modem operation to be compatible with both U.S. and European communication
requirements.</P>
<H3>Keyboard Features</H3>
<P>Some features are available to adapt the keyboard to various terminal applications.

<H4>Character Sets</H4>
<P>The DECwriter Correspondent has the capability of printing only one character set,
94 characters, at a time. In order to allow for a larger selection of printable characters,
the characters that can be printed by the terminal are divided into 11 sets &#8211;
U.S. ASCII, U.K., French Canada, Germany, Sweden, Finland, Norway/Denmark,
Italy, Spain, APL, and VT100 Line Drawing. Any of these sets can be selected as the
first (G0), second (G1), third (G2), or fourth (G3) printing character set. The computer
uses ANSI escape sequences to select the desired set. In order to select a particular
character set, you just select one of the following escape sequences.</P>

<P>The page length can be set to any length from 1/12 inch per page to 21 inches per
page at the selected vertical pitch. If the desired page length exceeds 21 inches,
then the printer will default to 21 inches.</P>
<H4>XON/XOFF Control Characters</H4>
<P>You can use the restraint control feature &#8211; XON/XOFF to prevent input buffer
overflows. When the input buffer receives more characters than a specified upper
limit (800 characters), the terminal transmits the selected signal, XOFF, to the host.
The host then stops transmitting characters.</P>
<P>As the terminal continues to remove and print characters, the number of characters
in the buffer decreases. When the input buffer holds 10 characters, the terminal
transmits a second signal, XON, to the host, who then resumes transmission.</P>
<H4>Horizontal Pitch</H4>
<P>This allows you to vary the width of printed characters as well as their spacing
(number of characters per inch). You can choose to print 10, 12, 13.2 or 16.5 single-width
characters per inch. If you wish to print double-width characters, you can
vary the pitch by 5, 6, 6.6, or 8.25 characters per inch.</P>
<P>The horizontal pitch selected determines the maximum column width as per
the chart below.</P>

</TABLE>
<H4>Horizontal Margins</H4>
<P>The horizontal-margins sequence sets the left and right margin. If both parameters
are not zero, and the first parameter is smaller than the second on, then the left
margin will be set to the first parameter, while the right margin will be set to the
second parameter. <STRONG>Note:</STRONG> Changing the horizontal pitch modifies the horizontal
margins.</P>
<H4>Horizontal Tabs</H4>
<P>A horizontal tab is a preselected point on a line to which the printhead advances
when a horizontal tab control character is received. The DECwriter Correspondent
has 132 possible horizontal tabs stops, one for each column.  These tab stops are
associated with column numbers, not physical positions on the paper. Thus, as was
the case with horizontal margins, changing horizontal pitch will also change the
physical position of tab stops.</P>
<H4>Print Resolution</H4>
<P>With the DECwriter Correspondent, you can select either normal printing, or for
greater emphasis, bold printing.</P>
<H4>Override Paper-Out</H4>
<P>For your application, it may be desirable to disable the paper out switch. With the
DECwriter Correspondent, you can select this feature.</P>
<P>Normally, when the paper-out switch detects that you are about to run out of
paper, it stops printing about one inch from the end of the page. If your application
requires printing to the very end of the page, you can use the paper-out override.</P>
<H4>Print Force</H4>
<P>Selecting the proper print force for your application is another feature provided by
the DECwriter Correspondent. Multipart forms require a high print force. This
ensures that each copy is as clear and legible as the first. A low print force is better
for single copies. By using the low force, your printhead lasts longer, and printing is
quieter.</P>
<H4>Vertical Pitch</H4>
<P>This allows you to vary the number of lines per inch. You can select to use 2, 3, 4,
6, 8, or 12 lines per inch.</P>
<H4>Vertical Margins</H4>
<P>You can set top and bottom vertical margins with this feature. The top vertical margin
specifies the first printable lines, while the bottom vertical margin specifies the
last printable line. When vertical pitch and form length are changed, the vertical
margins must be reset.</P>
<H4>Vertical Tabs</H4>
<P>A vertical tab is a preselected line to which the printhead advances when a vertical
tab control character is received. The printer has 168 vertical tab positions. Vertical
tabs can be set and cleared like horizontal tabs. Vertical tab stops are associated
with specific line numbers, not physical positions on the paper. Thus, changing
vertical pitch changes the printing position of the vertical tabs on the paper.</P>
<H3>Memories</H3>
<P>The DECwriter Correspondent terminal features are contained in three memories
&#8211; operating, user permanent, and default.</P>
<P>The terminal operates according to the features entered in the operating memory.
You can change a feature in the memory by entering SET-UP and changing the
feature. The operating memory features are horizontal and vertical pitch, margins,
and tabs, form length, and printer character sets.</P>
<P>User permanent memory is used to store operator selected features. The computer
cannot change the features stored in this memory. You can change them by
entering SET-UP, changing the feature, and performing a store procedure. User
memory features can be loaded into operating memory by performing a recall procedure.
When a recall procedure is performed, all the features previously stored in
operating memory are erased.</P>
<P>Default memory contains the typical selections for each SET-UP feature. These
are stored in the permanent memory and cannot be changed by the operator.</P>
<H3>Escape Sequences</H3>
<P>The DECwriter Correspondent (LA12) uses escape sequences standardized by the
American National Standard Institute (ANSI) to control many of its features. These
escape sequences provide additional controls that are not provided by the control
characters in the character set. These sequences are multiple-character control
functions are not printed, but are used to control printing and processing of characters.</P>
<P>Detailed information on escape sequences can be found in the <CITE>DECwriter Correspondent
Programmer Reference Manual</CITE> or in Appendix H at the end of this book.</P>
<H2>Maintenance</H2>
<P>The DECwriter Correspondent requires no preventative maintenance other than surface
cleaning. You can clean the external surfaces and platen with a damp cloth. Do
not use excessive water or cleaners with solvents. Rubbing the keycaps with a dry
or barely moist cloth is enough to clean them. <STRONG>Note:</STRONG> Do not remove the keycaps for
cleaning; damage to the switch contacts can occur if the keycaps are not replaced
correctly.</P>
<P>The terminal covers are not meant to be weatherproof. There are several openings
in the covers through which liquids, coins, paper clips, and other objects can
fall. Metal objects will disturb the electronic operations of any terminal if they come
within contact of the circuitry. For this reason, it is recommended that you do not
place drinks or metal objects on any part of the terminal.</P>
<P>The ventilation slots on the top and bottom of the terminal should be kept clear
to prevent overheating.</P>
<H3>Self-tests</H3>
<P>The DECwriter Correspondent offers a selection of self-tests. A power-up and
printer self-test occur automatically when the terminal is turned on. These provide
an initial visual indication of terminal operation. The other tests can be keyboard-operated
for further testing of terminal operation from set-up mode.</P>
<P>Other tests include:</P>
<UL>
<LI>EIA Operation Self-tests
