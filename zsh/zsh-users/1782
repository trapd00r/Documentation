I seem to recall that tcsh explicitly does a stty before it prints
the first prompt, setting all of its standard settings.  I have talked
with a few SCO people who found this annoying, as SCO has some different
(really demented, IMHO) ideas on what those settings should be (for
example, intr is set to ^?.)  They were confused about why their csh
used ^?, and their tcsh used ^C.


I suggest putting them in your .zlogin or .zprofile.  Not specifying
something like this is a good way to mess yourself up on cross-platform
hops, not to mention the fun you get when your sysadmin decides to
recompile your shell with different defaults, and forgets to mention it.
