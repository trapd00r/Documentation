Subject: zsh singlelinezle feature
Newsgroups: comp.unix.shell

Hello *,

I have a question concerning the singlelinezle option of zsh.
When turned on, the list-choices function does not work anymore. Why?
I am running zsh in ksh emulation, and this is quite an annoyance.

Also, the list of choices is displayed below the prompt. Can this be
configured to be displayed above the prompt? I am using zsh 4.0.4.

TIA!
