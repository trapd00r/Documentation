I don't have any problems with C03traps, but I notice

Test ../../Test/C01arith.ztst failed: bad status 1, expected 0 from:
  print $((##))
Error output:
(eval):1: bad math expression: illegal character: ^P
Was testing: ## without following character

on at least two of our mips autobuilders.

Any idea what this means?
