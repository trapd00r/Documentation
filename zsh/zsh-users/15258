Detecting that something is wrong is much easier than knowing what the 
correct fix is.

In the nomatch case, it bugs me (a lot) that other shells silently 
convert the input I've given them into something that is not equivalent.  
It commonly bites me with the '?' case (With '*' and '&', I usually 
notice that I need to quote something), but I'd much rather it complain 
than silently do something I don't intend.  E.g. catching the typo in:

mv otherstuff impotrant* /backup/

(Probably a lame example, but the point about not changing my input in 
ways I don't intend stands.)

For the same reason that SH_WORD_SPLIT isn't the default.  "What other 
shells do" isn't always the best indication of what Zsh users want.

(In my opinion, obviously.)
