I would be very surprised if any relatively recent system didn't
define SIGWINCH.  But you never know with some of these vendors.

zsh defines _INCLUDE_HPUX_SOURCE in system.h

#ifdef __hpux
#define _INCLUDE_POSIX_SOURCE
#define _INCLUDE_XOPEN_SOURCE
#define _INCLUDE_HPUX_SOURCE
#endif

If your system is having trouble picking this up, add
-D__hpux to the compile time flags.
