Ah, it's SUN_KEYBOARD_HACK causing the solitary backtick to be silently
discaraded.  With "zsh -f" I get what you got:

I see; but if completion is active you're now in a state where it's not 
possible to get zsh to recognize the EOF character, unless it's bound to 
something different than delete-char-or-list.  So you must type interrupt 
to get on with your life.  That's what bothers me ... but I guess it was 
always that way and I just never noticed before.
