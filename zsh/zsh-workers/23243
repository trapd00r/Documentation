Thanks for the work, it's very useful.

The test suite is good at stuff related to scripting and syntax,
moderately good but rather incomplete at the low levels of completion
and line editing, and poor at things which are only testable
interactively like job control.

Zle has changed so much that it might well be better to leave anything
alone that isn't obviously a standalone fix for a specific problem
that applies cleanly.  We've made various tweaks to simplify interfaces
both internally and to related parts of the main shell such as quoting
to make adding multibyte support easier; these aren't generally
bug fixes and don't need applying.

It would be fine if they just appeared in the ChangeLog on the branch.
