Good Morning,

Yesterday I tried compiling zsh 3.0.1 on a HP 9000/777 (a C110) running
HP-UX 10.20.  It did alright until it tried to make the builtin.c
section.  Here is part of the output from that.

--- Start make output ---

I also tried to make version 3.0.0.  It failed right away with the fixme
error.  Even though this doesn't happen with version 3.0.1, below is the
resource.h file you ask for when the fixme error shows up.

I was able to successfully build version 3.0.1 on a HP-UX 10.01 machine.
I then copied that over to the 10.20 machine.  I ran it there.  I only
did a few basic things with it though.  I'm not sure what problems it
will cause, if any.

I am not a member of any zsh mailing list, nor am I able to read the
newgroups.  If there are any further questions, or if there's something
you would like for me to try, please reply to this message.  My email
address is also included in the signature.

Thank you in advance.
