    Hi Bart :)

    But the problem I'm seeing is not that, the tty doesn't remain
"changed" after the STTY use. The problem is that STTY doesn't do
anything.

    Do you mean that STTY doesn't work *on purpose* because ZLE
couldn't reset the tty if STTY were used?

    I understand, but from the manual I suppose it worked in scripts,
too. I took a look at the source code, just in case, but I didn't
discovered any hint about STTY and INTERACTIVE relations.

    Thanks for the explanation, Bart :)
