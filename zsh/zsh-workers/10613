I'm don't think it makes the name useless, but... hey, I hadn't
thought of this multiple names in one string thing. Makes it look more 
like tag-order which is almost certainly a good thing.

One small problem: we always supported (in file-patterns and in the
argument to -g) multiple patterns separated by white space. If we find 
an acceptable syntax for this combined with the multiple-names thing,
I'll implement it. Using backslashes before the spaces would be the
wrong thing, though -- that's already used to include spaces in the
patterns.


Bye
 Sven
