If you have gcc, this should be OK; make sure you have it in the path.

This is /usr/ucb/cc, which is just a placeholder if you haven't installed
SUNWspro. I use the SunSoft's compiler here ( very fast... ) and it 
works w/o any problem:

brutus% ./configure
/tmp/zsh-3.0-pre4
creating cache ./config.cache
configuring for zsh 3.0-pre4
checking host system type... i386-unknown-solaris2.5.1
checking for gcc... no
checking for cc... cc
checking whether we are using GNU C... no
checking how to run the C preprocessor... cc -E
checking for working const... yes
checking whether cross-compiling... no
checking for cc option to accept ANSI C... 
checking for function prototypes... yes
checking size of long... 4
checking if signed to unsigned casting is broken... no
checking whether make sets ${MAKE}... yes
.....

(this was just the first zsh kit I found nearby to test ).
