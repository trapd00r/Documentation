Actually, list display does not work at all if terminal does not do automargins
(and even if it correctly says it in terminfo) and size of a single match exeeds
COLUMNS-2 (the is the last size that works). List display thinks that terminal
always does am (at least, this is how I interpret this) and gets number of lines
wrong and moves cursor far above original prompt :-) If you can switch am off,
just try it - it is funny.
