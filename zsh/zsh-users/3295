} This isn't quite how vi handles it, however.

True, but it is how your read-and-insert-char widget handles it.

} It would wait till you hit escape, then insert everything you typed
} that many times. That would need more work.

Yes; I have a vague idea that it could be done by stashing away a copy
of the zmod structure, and then upon ESC you restore it, decrement the
zmult field, and invoke virepeatchange() ... the tricky bit could be
interaction with the `lastmod' copy of zmod that startvichange() uses.
Or maybe lastmod already contains almost everything we need ...

} Plus in zsh there are other ways of exiting insert mode than
} returning to command mode --- what should happen on `return'?

The same thing that happens now when you type e.g. `8 d RET' -- it just
accepts the buffer as it stands, aborting the repeat.
