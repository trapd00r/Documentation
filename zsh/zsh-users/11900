===================

1) if the completion widget for rsync farts after the "--" option, that's 
a problem with the _rsync function.

2) whether i declare "cpv" as an alias or a function, the completion 
system "interprets it" as the command is rsync, not cpv. if there's no way 
around that it seems like a problem with the completion system... no?

3) in this particular case, if #1 is addressed things will work fine (with 
some interesting exceptions), but #2 is still a problem.
