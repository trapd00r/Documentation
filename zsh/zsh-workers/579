Thanks for confirming that the problems were not just mine.  Unless
you need me to test it, instead of finding the patch in the list
archives, I will wait for a later release.

I tried the patch you sent, and zsh now works under emacs but does not
work under xterm.

FWIW, I think that I have tried about 5 versions of zsh, including the
most recent release and several recent betas, and that the only one I
have gotten to work is 2.3.1.  Maybe things will stabilize when 2.6
goes "gamma".  Anybody know when 2.6 will likely be released?  I am
just looking for reliability and speed, since I am not a feature
creature and I prefer not to attempt to hack on the zsh source.
