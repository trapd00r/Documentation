I have this little snippet:

if [ -r /LocalLibrary/Images/Icons/tempPark.tiff -a ! -r /tmp/.dir.tiff ] then   
         ln -s /LocalLibrary/Images/Icons/tempPark.tiff /tmp/.dir.tiff

fi

When I run it and there is already a /tmp/.dir.tiff it exits = 1

I am curious why it does that, since there shouldn't be any 'error' --- or  
am I missing something?
