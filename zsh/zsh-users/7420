(Don't copy zsh-workers on messages to zsh-users.  I think it's smart
enough to sort it out but you shouldn't anyway.)

You need in to save what I sent you on a directory in your $fpath.

In your start-up file you will have something like

autoload -U insert-args-of
zle -N insert-args-of
bindkey '^x^a' insert-args-of

See various similar examples in the zshcontrib manual page.
