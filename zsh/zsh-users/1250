Well, tell the ZShell to "save" your history then:

	SAVEHIST
	The maximum number of history events to save in the history file.
 
related vars:

	HISTFILE
	The file to save the history in when an interactive shell exits.
	If unset, the history is not saved.
	HISTSIZE
	The maximum size of the history list.

I refuse to edit addresses.  If you really want a direct reply
then you will have to give a *valid* address!
