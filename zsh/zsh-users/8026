That would be completely unworkable for the vast majority of special
contextual completions.  You can bind a key that just does filename
completion, however.  This binds it to \C-f.  Oliver may know some
gotchas I'm missing.

zle -C complete-filename complete-word _generic
zstyle ':completion:complete-filename:*' completer _files
bindkey '^xf' complete-filename
