In other words - setting styles for partucular tag has a side effect of
enabling this tag? I find it really confusing. Do not we have special tag to
enable/disable tags (ough :-) Hmm looks, like not. The closest is
tag-order - and if it gets slightly different name (without so much strngth
on ``order'') - it is quite usable to say, which tags and in which order.

In the case above - files and path_files should have default tags to try and
with default patterns. If you do not want to see all files - set tag-order
to the correct tags. If you wnat other patterns - set file-patterbs. If you
want only particular tags with particular patterns - set both.
