Yep, it works, thank you. This version also does not output error
messages about duplicated nodes as 1.62 did (well, there were a couple
of patches to docs in between as well). But links to Indices in ZSH docs
are still wrong.  This happens only if the -split_chapter option is used
(default in Zsh Makefile):

TEXI2HTML = texi2html -expandinfo -split_chapter

If this option is omitted, links in single file are correct. I also
tried to play with (no-)section_navigation, but looks, it does not
depend on it (I personally prefer this option).
