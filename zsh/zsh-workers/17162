Subject: PATCH: gethostbyaddr() argument in tcp.c
Date: Tue, 14 May 2002 18:44:27 +0100
Message-ID: <13034.1021398267@csr.com>
From: Peter Stephenson <pws@csr.com>

This one is entirely cosmetic.  The latest POSIX/SUS/ISO specification
says the first argument is `const void *', which wouldn't cause a
warning; however, solaris uses `const char *', which does.  Converting
explicitly to `const void *' should keep everybody happy, I hope.
