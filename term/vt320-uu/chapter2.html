<H1 ID="S2"><SPAN CLASS="chapnum">2</SPAN> A Look at the Terminal</H1>
<P>The VT320 is a general-purpose video display terminal that lets you interact
with software applications on a host computer system. This chapter provides a
brief overview of the VT320 terminal and how it operates.</P>
<H2 ID="S2.1">VT320 Components</H2>
<P>The VT320 terminal has two main components, a monitor/terminal unit and
keyboard (<A HREF="#F2-1">Figure 2-1</A>). The monitor/terminal unit is simply called the terminal
in the rest of this manual.</P>

</TR>
</TBODY>
</TABLE>
<H3 ID="S2.1.1">Terminal</H3>
<P>The VT320 uses a 356&nbsp;mm (14&nbsp;in) monochrome screen that can display 24
lines of text, in 80 or 132 columns. Line 25 is reserved for the terminal's
status line. You can connect the terminal to a host computer, terminal server,
or modem. You can also connect a printer directly to the terminal.</P>
<H3 ID="S2.1.2">Keyboard</H3>
<P>The keyboard has four groups of keys and four indicator lights, described in
<A HREF="chapter3.html">Chapter 3</A>. The main keypad is similar to a typewriter keyboard. The keyboard
cable connects to the right side of the terminal.</P>
<P>There are 15 models of the VT320 keyboard available, for different languages.
Appendix D shows the 15 keyboards.</P>
<H2 ID="S2.2">How the VT320 Works</H2>
<P>You use the keyboard to interact with an application on your system. You send
data to the application by typing on the keyboard. Data sent by the application
appears as text on the screen. You can print text from the VT320, if you have
a printer connected to the terminal.</P>
<P>Applications use programming functions to perform many operations. The
VT320 can work with standard American National Standards Institute (ANSI)
functions.</P>
<H3 ID="S2.2.1">Set-Up</H3>
<P>The VT320 has a series of set-up screens that list the operating features of the
terminal. You can display these screens and change feature settings from the
keyboard.</P>
<P>For example, the VT320 has an <SPAN CLASS="feature">On-Line/Local</SPAN> feature. You can only set this
feature from set-up. When you use the <SPAN CLASS="setting">"On-Line"</SPAN> setting, the VT320 can communicate
with your host system.</P>
<P>To enter set-up, you press the <SPAN CLASS="keyname">Set-Up</SPAN> key. <A HREF="chapter4.html">Chapter 4</A> describes set-up.</P>
<H3 ID="S2.2.2">Emulating VT Series Terminals</H3>
<P>The VT320 can also operate as a VT200 series, VT100 series, or VT52 terminal.
You select the operating mode from the General Set-Up screen (<A HREF="chapter4.html">Chapter
4</A>). There are four possible settings.</P>
<UL>
<LI>VT300 mode, 7-bit controls</LI>
<LI>VT300 mode, 8-bit controls</LI>
<LI>VT100 mode</LI>
<LI>VT52 mode</LI>
</UL>
<P>The factory default setting is VT300 mode, 7-bit controls. This mode is fully
compatible with VT200 series terminals. Use this mode for VT200 applications.
<DFN>Factory-default</DFN> settings are the initial settings the terminal uses when shipped
from the factory. These settings are permanently stored in the terminal's
memory. You can use set-up to reset the VT320 to the factory-default settings
at any time.</P>
<H2 ID="S2.3">Character Sets</H2>
<P>The VT320 has two types of built-in character sets, for use with different types
of computer systems.</P>
<UL>
<LI>8-bit multinational sets</LI>
<LI>7-bit national replacement character sets</LI>
</UL>
<P>You can select from 2 multinational sets or 12 national replacement character
sets (NRCs). You use the <STRONG>Character Set Mode</STRONG> feature in the General Set-Up
screen (<A HREF="chapter4.html">Chapter 4</A>) to select the type of character set: <SPAN CLASS="setting">"8-Bit Characters"</SPAN> for
multinational sets, or <SPAN CLASS="setting">"7-Bit Characters"</SPAN> for NRC sets.</P>
<H3 ID="S2.3.1">Multinational Character Sets</H3>
<P>When you first use your VT320, the terminal uses the DEC Multinational character
set. This set contains the characters for the English language, plus most
characters used in the Western European languages. Use this set with applications
that require strict compatibility with VT200 series terminals.</P>
<P>You can also select the ISO Latin-1 character set of the International
Standards Organization. ISO Latin-1 is the new industry-standard set. It is
similar to the DEC Multinational character set, with a few different symbols
and characters.</P>
<P>Both multinational sets include the standard ASCII character set of the
American Standard Code for Information Interchange.</P>
<H3 ID="S2.3.2">National Replacement Character Sets</H3>
<P>NRC sets are for 7-bit computing environments. Each NRC set is for a particular
Western European language or dialect. NRC sets are similar to the ASCII
set, but replace a few ASCII characters with characters used in that language
or dialect.</P>
<P>You can only use one NRC set at a time. You select the NRC set by setting
the <SPAN CLASS="feature">Keyboard</SPAN> feature in the Set-Up Directory (<A HREF="chapter4.html">Chapter 4</A>).</P>
<P>If you set the <SPAN CLASS="feature">Character Set Mode</SPAN> feature in the General Set-Up screen to
<SPAN CLASS="setting">"7-Bit Characters"</SPAN>, you cannot use the 8-bit multinational character sets.
However, if you set <SPAN CLASS="feature">Character Set Mode</SPAN> to <SPAN CLASS="setting">"8-Bit Characters"</SPAN> you can still use
an NRC set. In that case, the NRC set replaces the ASCII set.</P>
<H3 ID="S2.3.3">Summary</H3>
<P><A HREF="#F2-2">Figure 2-2</A> summarizes how to select a character set by using set-up features.
<A HREF="appendixe.html">Appendix E</A> shows each character set.</P>

<H2 ID="S2.4">CRT Saver Feature</H2>
<P>The VT320 has a CRT saver feature to extend the life of the terminal's screen.
The screen automatically goes blank if the terminal is inactive for 30 minutes
(no keyboard activity or input from the host system). You do not lose the data
that was displayed. To reactivate the screen, press any key.</P>
<P>When the CRT saver feature is on, a blinking block cursor appears at the
lower-right corner of the screen. The cursor indicates that the terminal is still
on and the CRT saver feature is activated.</P>
