Why is it so similar ... is it not the same as was implemented for
copy-prev-shell-word? I mean, in this case c-p-s-w may well be
implemented as pure shell-level widget ... may be, it is not worth it
now ...

The only problem is, what happens if current line is incomplete? That
is, is this modifier useful in widgets that deal with current line?
Suppose, we have something like ``echo "foo '' - what will be the result
of (z) modifier?
