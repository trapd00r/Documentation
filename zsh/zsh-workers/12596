 that you want to link.  Module names typically must begin with "zsh/";
-only modules appearing in Src/Aliases/*.mdd may omit the "zsh/" prefix.
+see the ".mdd" file for the module for the actual name.  The modules must
+be listed in dependency order, e.g., "zsh/zle" must precede "zsh/complete",

 Note that the modules depending on zle or complete (e.g.: complist and
 deltochar) cannot be loaded dynamically on systems which do not allow symbols
