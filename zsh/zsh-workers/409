Yes, you are exactly right. Thanks!

Unfortunately, in playing with this I think I discoverd a small bug
(or at least ksh incompatability) in zsh:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
charney$ ksh
$ TZ=GMT-$((18+$((${2:-1}-1))*24)) date +%j
273
$ ^D
charney$ echo $ZSH_VERSION
2.6-beta10-hzoli10.2
charney$ TZ=GMT-$((18+$((${2:-1}-1))*24)) date +%j
zsh: ')' expected

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If not a bug, is there an alternate syntax I can use in zsh?
