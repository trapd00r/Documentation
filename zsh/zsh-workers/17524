} Is this one fixed in 4.0.5?

There wasn't any specific commit for this bug.  If I had to guess, I'd
say 16364 and 16351 are the most likely to have had any effect.  The
stack trace you sent gave me no clues at all.

} I saw bug 17517 but not sure if this is the one.

It's not, unless your process is crashing because it ran out of memory.

} BTW, how can I access the bug database?  Thanks.

There's a bug database under the zsh project on sourceforge, but we don't
really use it.  The numbers in the ChangeLog refer to the zsh-workers
article number in which the patch (or at least a description of the way
to fix the bug) appeared.  You can find those articles through the list
archive interface at <http://www.zsh.org/mla/>.
