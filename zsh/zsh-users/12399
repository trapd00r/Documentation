Why don't you just chsh (man chsh) on your host instead of
doing .bashrc trickery? You all share the same shell account
on a single host?

You could also try to test the bash interactivity flag, and only
run zsh of it's set. Have not tried it myself, but here's a
snippet from the bash manual:

        An interactive shell is  one  started  without  non-option
        arguments  and  without the -c option whose standard input
        and output are both connected to terminals (as  determined
        by  isatty(3)), or one started with the -i option.  PS1 is
        set and $- includes i if bash is interactive,  allowing  a
        shell script or a startup file to test this state.
