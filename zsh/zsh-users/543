Hi,

I just compiled zsh-3.0.1 on an aix4.1.4-workstation. i have an old version
(2.5.03) running and it works perfectly fine.

In the new version, cursor keys, e.g., also work but I don't SEE their
result. The backspace key removes characters for the shell, but not visibly for
me. etc.

Any help?

	Gerd
