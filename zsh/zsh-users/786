It seems that you have broken header files which do not have prototype for
fdopen(), struct sigaction etc.  You can either upgrade to Linux or
complain to SUN (which should be easy, as you seem to work for SUN).  But
as I remember others already managed to compile zsh on x86-solaris, so it
is possible that something is broken in your OS setup.
