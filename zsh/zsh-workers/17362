} This changes the behaviour of accept-line-and-down-history to accept the
} line unconditionally, even if it can't go down in the history.
} Previously, if you were on the last line in the history it just beeped.

I think this patch is fine.  If there were any reason for the previous
behavior, it would be because some older shell or e.g. emacs behaved
that way on a similar action.
