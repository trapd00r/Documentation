This sounds as if

    less log.a/*(om[1])

would show me the newest file in that directory.  That is not what
I'm looking for, but not too bad, either.  Hm.  Perhaps a function
"lessnew" expecting a directory and an optional number would do the
trick.

But if somebody knows the exact feature I was asking for, that would
be better.
