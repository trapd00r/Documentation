If printeightbit is set, then nicechar() may pass 8-bit characters,
which may be metafied, straight through, so ztrlen() is probably better.
printeightbit doesn't guaranteed to get character lengths right, but
counting metafied characters as 1 is more consistent.

I don't think we need to take account of wide characters here; we don't
have the information for that in this branch of the code.
