They have a `len' of 4 and a `strs' that points to four bytes of garbage.
The crashes appear to happen after dupeprog() copies `strs' -- the new
copy often ends up pointing to a different four bytes of garbage.

In the prompt stuff, as long as I never let the function body be empty --
that is, I replace e.g.

        functions[TRAPWINCH]="${functions[TRAPWINCH]//prompt_bart_winch}"

with

        functions[TRAPWINCH]="${functions[TRAPWINCH]//prompt_bart_winch/:}"

the crashes never happen.  Only if the function body becomes empty do I
have any problem.
 
} Ok. If you could give me an easy example of how to make bld_eprog()
} give garbled results, I'd be thankful. Just doing `functions[foo]=""'
} at least gives me sensible results.

Try `functions[foo]=" "' so there is a non-empty string there but it
contains no useful tokens.

I'll try to do some more debugging this morning and send some gdb output.
