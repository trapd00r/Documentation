    Wayne, thanks for showing me how utterly stupid I am O:))) I knew
about this feature, but I thought that it was a zsh thing, non
portable. I didn't even look that in SUS. I just looked a moment ago
to make sure it was non portable and SUS specifies just the same :((

    Well, thanks for your help because you're solved my problem. I
didn't even think about using this mechanism O:)

    I think that I will substitute it with the name of the file that
must be generated so the filtering in the sed script is easier.

    Thanks a lot, Wayne :)
