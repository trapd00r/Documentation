Try putting that setopt in .zprofile, _above_ your variable definition,
or move the variable definition into .zshrc.  The execution order of
startup scripts is:

.zshenv .zprofile .zshrc .zlogin

So AUTO_NAME_DIRS isn't yet set when the variable is first set.  You
could also run

hash -d palmfiles=~/Documents/Palm/Users/Aaron\ Davies/Files\ to\ Install

which will create a named directory without the matching shell variable
(if that's what you want).
