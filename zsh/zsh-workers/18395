Hey together,

I think I've found a bug with uname -v in both 4.0.6 and 4.1.0dev7.

If I add "ulimit -v 100000" which is 100 megabytes worth of virtual
memory, zsh still runs out and dies as soon as it have to do something.

# ulimit -v 100000
# zsh
zsh: 28234 segmentation fault  zsh
# cd <TAB>
zsh:6: fatal error: out of heap memory
