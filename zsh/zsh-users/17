I don't forsee this happening any time soon.  There are too many other
things still in the pipeline that need to be done.  Also, I don't like
the idea of adding features to the baseline that would only be used by
people on a particular OS.

But if someone creates a patch, I could always put it in a Contrib
directory for people that are interested.
