Using either the HPUX ANSI C compiler or GCC 3.0.2, I have the
following problem when compiling zsh 4.0.4 on HPUX 10.20:

cc -Ae -c -I.  -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -O  -o termcap.o termcap.c
cc: "/usr/include/term.h", line 535: error 1000: Unexpected symbol: "SGTTY".
cc: "/usr/include/term.h", line 536: error 1000: Unexpected symbol: "SGTTY".
cc: "/usr/include/term.h", line 535: error 1573: Type of "Ottyb" is undefined due to an illegal declaration.

cc: "termcap.c", line 270: warning 527: Integral value implicitly converted to pointer in assignment.
*** Error exit code 1

Stop.

Does anyone have any suggestions on how to fix this?

Thanks in advance,
