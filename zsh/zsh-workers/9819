Subject: $curcontext in _subscript
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

In my .zshrc, I have zstyle to define a tag-order of 'indexes parameters' for -subscript- because I don't want it to complete all variables after something like '$path['. This stopped working a while ago.

It seems that when _subscript is run, $curcontext is ':complete:-subscript-'. Why is 'completion' not in there as the first bit. As far as I can tell, 'complete' is put there by the complete completer.

What exactly should I be using as the parameters to zstyle to achieve this: it works with '*-subscript-*' but I'd prefer to use something more specific.
