Is there any progress on the Sourceforge front ? Or has anyone started
their own CVS repository ?

Will there be snapshots again ?

I know I appear to have only questions but it is the only way I could help
the developement of zsh (even if it is limited to try to run the
dev. versions due to time constraints...).
