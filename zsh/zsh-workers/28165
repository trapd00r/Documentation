> Peter, how's this look?

Oops apparently I haven't updated from CVS in a while at work and I
see you already made some changes back here which conflict with mine:

revision 1.238
date: 2010/02/22 10:12:31;  author: pws;  state: Exp;  lines: +27 -11
27721: rationalise initialisation of file descriptors

I'll send an updated patch..

Greg
