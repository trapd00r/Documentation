1.) is it possible to assign standard output and/or standard error
from a job to a device after it has been put in the background.

  For example, 
    % find . -name '*mat' -print &
  then do something like
    % %1 > /dev/null

2.) why is it that when I do history -f, I get dates and times that refer to
the latest login and not to the date and time of command execution in the
history.

For example,

  105  10/21/1995 09:44  cd News <--- this command was run 10/20 not 10/21
  106  10/21/1995 09:44  mail -f z <-- this is correct

thanks.
