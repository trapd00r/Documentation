Hi!

I've got this:
 zstyle ':completion:*:paths' special-dirs yes
in my dot files, because I like . and .. to be completed (and / appended),
too.  A few days I upgraded from 3.1.6-dev-19 to 3.1.6-dev-20.  Now the
behavior has changed.  Hitting TAB after typing "cd .." still works, but
after "mv foo .." or "ls .." doesn't.  It also doesn't complete after
"cd bar/..".  I supposse something has changed somewhere...

Could some kind soul please tell me what settings I need to get the old
behavior back?

Thanks a mill!
 Andy.

 Do you really want all files not to be deleted (Y/n) ?
