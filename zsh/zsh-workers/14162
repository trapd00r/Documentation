I thought the same at first, couldn't immediately come up with a simple
enough pattern for that and then remembered that in `echo a~b' the `a~b'
isn't treated as a pattern unless there are other pattern characters,
too.  So, that change should be ok (now that I remembered to add the
parentheses to the pattern).
