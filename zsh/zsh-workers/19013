    Hi Oliver :)

    Oh, yes, you're true, it was just a quick hack, not a good work ;))
The point was the four processes neeced for this, and your answer
below. Thanks a lot!!

    That's great! A very good example of what I was looking for: the
power of Zsh to do things faster ;)))) Right now I don't understand
the entire line (but I'm new to expansions...), but I will take a
look at the manual. Thanks a lot, truly :)

    The point is to examine /proc. Some of the things can be done
using 'cat' and the like, but a couple of them must be done with the
stat syscall, and maybe zsh/mapfile to read the file contents in an
easy way. Really, Zsh is just incredible :)
