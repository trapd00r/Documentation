Subject: Rewrite of compsys.yo
Date: Mon, 14 Apr 2003 19:15:44 +0100
Message-ID: <8773.1050344144@csr.com>
From: Peter Stephenson <pws@csr.com>

I have spent hours and hours rewriting Doc/Zsh/compsys.yo; unfortunately
I am going on holiday till the end of next week so won't get it finished
before then.  I have got to the end of the description of _describe.
The diff is huge and not particularly enlightening so I have simply
committed the changes so far.
  cvs diff -u -r 1.164 -r 1.165 Doc/Zsh/compsys.yo
will recreate the diff for you.

The new version is certainly imperfect but should be clearer.  It was
quite tough going so it's possible I have got something or other
completely wrong.

Since nothing serious has cropped up I hope to finish this and release
4.1.1 soon after my return.  (I realise this is not the traditional way
round.)
