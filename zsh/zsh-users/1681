[snipped...lots of suggestions]

hmm...maybe there is a simple solution,

how about making the file a named pipe ? 
then a process could simply read from it and write to a somefile.date and the
reading process could simply keep changing .date part as frequent as one
programs it to.
 
 any problems with this ???
