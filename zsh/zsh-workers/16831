If Peter wants to commit his change first, I'll do the merge and
commit my change later. It is only the first line that needs any
merging anyway.

I'd be tempted to add -redirect-,<,bzip2=bzip2 too so that completion
after bzip2 -c < and bzip2 -cd < also work. Ideally, we should stop it
from completing options but it would still need _arguments with ! specs
if the checks for -d and -z options are still to work.
