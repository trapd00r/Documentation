With the latest CVS:

bor@itsrm2% zsh -f
itsrm2% zmodload -ud zsh/zleparameter zsh/zle
zsh: bus error (core dumped)  zsh -f

Note, that bus error normaly means unaligned memory access here (MIPS R4400).
That is quite different from out-of-bounds error.

In any case, if you can test if current CVS builds on AIX, it would be very
nice. I made some changes for Cygwin - hopefully, they do not affect other
systems.

I use grouping (zstyle ':completion:*' group-name '') and if there are no
matches for a given tag, it is not printed. Dunno in general case.
