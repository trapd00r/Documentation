Turns out this is happening because $LISTPROMPT remains set even after
the style is deleted.  This is presently unavoidable because complist
doesn't get a chance to examine LISTPROMPT until after _main_complete
has exited ... the same reason it's not possible to have both the "do
you wish ..." question and scrolling when you answer "yes".

So to disable list-prompt you have to both remove the style and also
unset LISTPROMPT.
