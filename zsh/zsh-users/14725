} results in normal output

Nothing in the normal shell configuration could cause this behavior.

Are you able to reproduce this behavior with "zsh -f" ?  If so, what
are the contents of your /etc/zshenv file?  (File location may differ
if you've installed zsh from prepackaged binaries.)

If not, the only thing that immediately comes to mind that might be
a cause of this is the value of $histchars, but even that doesn't
make sense to me.  What version of zsh is this?  Do you perhaps have
some kind of command-not-found handler set up?
