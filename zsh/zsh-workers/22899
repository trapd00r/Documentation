I now understand the problem. The library flags given in the zsh
configuration are -ltermcap or -lcurses (if --with-curses-terminfo
is used). And I have:

prunille:~> locate libcurses
/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.3.9.sdk/usr/lib/libcurses.dylib
/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk/usr/lib/libcurses.dylib
/usr/lib/libcurses.dylib
prunille:~> locate libtermcap
/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.3.9.sdk/usr/lib/libtermcap.dylib
/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk/usr/lib/libtermcap.dylib
/usr/lib/libtermcap.dylib

Both are a symbolic link to /usr/lib/libncurses.5.4.dylib.

I think that zsh should have --with-ncurses and --with-ncursesw
configure options, to be able to use the corresponding libraries.

(Alternatively, the ncurses and ncursesw MacPorts ports could add
compatibility symlinks, but I don't think that zsh should rely on
that.)
