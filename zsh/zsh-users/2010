I've been gently reminded that my chronology is flawed.  I did indeed quit
paying much attention to zsh from late 2.4 to late 2.6, but in reviewing
the situation I find that griping about ksh compatibility changes was what
got me involved again, not what drove me away.

Reviewing a few extremely old email messages, I find that it was setopt
incompatibilities that finally stopped me from using the later 2.4s and
on through 2.5.  Those setopt changes were designed to promote Bourne
shell (not ksh) compatibility, by disabling a number of csh features,
and caused syntax errors in many people's rc files at my site.
