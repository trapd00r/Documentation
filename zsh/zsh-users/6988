Subject: How do I complete from words in a file? (again)
Message-ID: <20040111153729.GC4628@fruitcom.com>
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Disposition: inline
User-Agent: Mutt/1.5.4i
X-Virus-Scanned: by amavisd-new-20030616-p5 (Debian os)

For example I have keys in the form
"_what_ever_" in certain files and want to type
on the command line:
_wh<tab>

and this should give me all the words commencing 
with `_wh' in the specified files.

This completion could occur anywhere on the command line.

FWIW I am using compsys.

Thanks for any help!
