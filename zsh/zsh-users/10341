Hi Ra=FAl,

 the problem has been solved in between:
 The thing is, that vim and Microemacs are a little too smart as to be =

 helpful in this special case (and I myself didn't know that ;)

 My first line of the script was

 #!/bin/zsh^M

 and an interpreter with the name 'zsh^M' does not exist on my system.

 BANG!

 But the '^M' wasn't visible to me, since vim and Microemacs both
 recognized that file as to be "DOS-borne" and switches into DOS-mode
 internally. Vim and Microemacs have special modes to display
 all non-printable characters and would (as I thought in that moment) =

 display a stray ^M if switched to that mode.

 BUT they were als in DOS-mode, which means a ^M isn't a stray
 character but one half of the end of line in DOS mode (CR/LF instead
 of LF)

 So I only saw a "#!/bin/zsh$", which looks ok.

 The swiss army knife in this case was "cat". Cat doesn't know
 anything about DOS/UNIX or whatever. It simply pull everything =

 into visibility when called as "cat -v".

 And then there were light... ;O))

 Keep hacking and thanks a lot for your help!
 Meino
