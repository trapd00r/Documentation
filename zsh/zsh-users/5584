Yeah, and it occurs to me I could "^Aecho " to get it in history, then
wipe out this echo to run it, but I think my hands are too wired to ^C
for things along this line to work very well.

I'm surprised "# foo" tries to run a command called "#". That could be
a fun program name.

I think HIST_ADD_CANCELED would be useful to enough people to have it
added. (at least as useful as the 30 or so other history options)
