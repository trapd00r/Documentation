<H1 ID="S10"><SPAN CLASS="chapnum">10</SPAN><BR>Solving Problems and Getting Service</H1>
<P>This chapter describes what to do if you have a problem with the VT420.
The chapter also describes the terminal's power-up self-test and screen
error messages.</P>
<H2 ID="S10.1">Operating Problems</H2>
<P><A HREF="#T10-1">Table 10-1</A> lists some possible operating problems and their suggested
solutions. Check this list before calling for service. If you need service,
see the "Digital Service" section in this chapter.</P>
<H2 ID="S10.2">Power-Up Self-Text</H2>
<P>Every time you turn the terminal on, the VT420 automatically runs a
power-up self-test. This test checks the operating status of many of the
terminal's internal parts.</P>
<P><STRONG>Successful test:</STRONG> If the test is successful, a <TT>VT420 OK</TT> message appears on
the screen. The keyboard bell should ring once.</P>
<P><STRONG>Error:</STRONG> If the keyboard bell does not ring or it rings similar to a telegraph
sound, this indicates a self-test error. The keyclick and bell sound
patterns are codes that provide service personnel with information about
the terminal's operating condition.</P>
<H2 ID="S10.3">Error Messages</H2>
<P>If the VT420 fails the power-up self-test, the terminal may display one of
the error messages in <A HREF="#T10-2">Table 10-2</A>. Only qualified service personnel should
try to correct these problems. If possible, note the error message that
appears, then call for service.</P>
