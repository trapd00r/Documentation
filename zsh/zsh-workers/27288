Subject: zero- vs one- based array indexing?

Can someone give me a quick history of why zsh defaults to one-based
array indexing?  Bash and ksh appear to use zero-based indexing, and
probably most CS types prefer that too.  Would it be OK to add an
option to control just zero-based arrays separately from the other
changes KSHARRAYS brings?

thanks,
Greg
