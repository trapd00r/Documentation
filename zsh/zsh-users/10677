No, not really.  What exactly do you mean by "the latest" by the way?
I've been following their mailing list, and there's a new revision
coming up for publication later this year.

My guess is that it's already too late for any newly-released version of
zsh to be considered stable enough to go into RHEL5.  I don't know about
Debian.  Clint?
