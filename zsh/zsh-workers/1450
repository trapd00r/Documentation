This has been affecting me recently; I just tracked it down to the
following:

The "read" command in zsh2.6-beta21 behaves strangely when the input
exceeds 63 characters; the remaining characters in the line are
truncated.  For example :

$ read x
1234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890
$ echo $x
123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123
$

I don't *think* this affected previous versions of zsh.  If a static
buffer is being used for "read", might I suggest that it be increased in
size to something greater than 64 bytes?

(Apologies if this has been pointed out already; I don't subscribe to
zsh-workers any more so I'm not up to speed on the current discussion.
Please e-mail me with comments.)
