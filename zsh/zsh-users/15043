I was wondering along the lines you suggest, but the counterargument is
that if you do:

zsh -fc '{ trap "echo exit trap running" EXIT; exit} | cat'

you get the expected message when the left-hand-side (explicitly) exits.
It's not clear to me it should be different on an implicit exit.  Traps
are an area where bugs and features are particularly intertwined.  I may
get around to looking at what I think the code is doing.  (Any
suggestion of vagueness in that sentence is entirely intentional...)
