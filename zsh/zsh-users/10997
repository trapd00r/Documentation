You could always post the startup file.  :)  As a suggestion, search
in the file with your favorite editor for lines that contain "${(".
It's probably referring to an invalid flag inside of a set of
parentheses immediately following the beginning of a parameter
substitution.  Comment out those lines one by one and see which one
makes the error stop.  Also, if it's on exit, you should limit your
search to .zlogout and any traps that you have set on exit.
