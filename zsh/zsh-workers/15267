It's probably a good thing that our test suites are starting to catch
more regressions:

/usr/local/src/zsh-2001-07-05/Test/V01zmodload.ztst: test failed.

The V01zmodload.ztst failure showed up on July 2nd, I believe.

This is all under:

Linux zion.rcn.com 2.4.6 #2 SMP Wed Jul 4 12:30:42 EDT 2001 i686 unknown

with gcc-3.0 and gcc-2.95.3.
