Hi,

I'm running zsh 4.3.9 on Cygwin and external commands show up twice when 
I attempt completion (see below). The background is that all external 
commands are actually Windows executables (cat.exe for example) and made 
available as commands without the .exe extension by the Cygwin emulation 
layer.

Is there a way to only show "cat" for instance and not "cat" and 
"cat.exe"?
