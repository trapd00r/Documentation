Hey,

I noticed that subshells of an interactive shell consider themself intera=
ctive as well.  I am not sure if this is desired, but making them non-int=
eractive helps to solve my real issue:

when executing

	zsh% (cd .)

my chpwd function is executed.  In a subshell, I want to avoid that.  Mak=
ing the subshell be non-interactive and checking [[ -o interactive ]] in =
my chpwd() does the trick, but maybe there is a better solution?

cheers
  simon
