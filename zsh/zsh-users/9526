}     OK, that works. So STTY doesn't work if the shell is not
} interactive, right? I don't understand why :?

It's because scripts don't have ZLE to automatically reset the tty again
after the change for that one command.

The real intended usage of STTY is either to be typed at the prompt as a 
prefix to some command you know to need it, or to be included in aliases
(which are expected only to be used interactively) in the same way.
