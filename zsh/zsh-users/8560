Dear Meino:

Two great places to get more information on how zsh works:

1.  http://zsh.sunsite.dk/Guide/   The user-friendly user's guide to 
zsh.  I found this to be extremely helpful and very well-written.  The 
author has a well-developed sense of humo(u)r.  I printed it out and 
had it bound (inexpensively).  On-line it is free.

2.  From bash to Z shell -- this is a new book that describes much of 
how to use zsh (as well as bash) in detail.   http://babyurl.com/IRADe2 
    It is well worth the money.

HTH,

Bill
