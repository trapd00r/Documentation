check the defines in config.h some of them aren't used right:

config.h:
---
/* Define if you have the <dl.h> header file.  */
#define HAVE_DL_H 1

/* Define if you have the <dlfcn.h> header file.  */
#define HAVE_DLFCN_H 0
---

Src/module.c:
---
#ifdef HAVE_DLFCN_H
# include <dlfcn.h>
#else
# ifdef HAVE_DL_H
---

This kind of makes configure useless:)
besides that zsh is great
