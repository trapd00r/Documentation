The time formats in the prompts are now strftime(3) compatible, so the
strftime sequence %l gives you the space to keep the string length
constant.  %L was added to give you the old behaviour.  See PROMPT
EXPANSION in the zshmisc manual page.  Try changing the appropriate
part of your prompt to %D{%L:%M%p} for 3.1.4.
