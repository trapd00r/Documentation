Subject: PATCH: ${(z)...} with error
Date: Fri, 14 Jun 2002 14:14:07 +0100
Message-ID: <15432.1024060447@csr.com>
From: Peter Stephenson <pws@csr.com>

If a ${(z)...} aborts early, the space we added at the end for the lexer
to be able to spot the end of the last word isn't stripped, so we end up
returning a final string with a bogus space at the end.

It's hard to know if there are pathological cases, however.  I think
this is better than it was before, but it may well not be perfect.

It would actually be quite nice to indicate to the user a lexical error
in the last word, but it's hard to pass back.
