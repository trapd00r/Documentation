from the man page:
   The values of RANDOM form an intentionally-repeatable pseudo-random 
sequence; subshells that reference RANDOM will result in identical 
pseudo-random values unless the value of RANDOM is referenced or seeded in 
the parent shell in between subshell invocations.

i'm curious about the "intentionally-repeatable" sequence. where would i 
find out more?
