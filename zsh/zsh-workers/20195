Yes, I saw that, it's in my example under the compdef header. Is it
-equal- or -equals- though? And are there any examples of this anywhere? I
saw that _bzip2 uses -redirect-, but it wasn't obvious how to apply that
to my situation with -equal-. There doesn't seem to be any command that
does use -equal-, that I've found.

Sure, the man page for zshcompsys says this under _values 6th paragraph

  All other arguments describe the possible values and their arguments 
  in the same format used for the description of options by the _arguments
  function (see above).  The only  differences  are that  no minus or plus
  sign is required at the beginning, values can have only one argument,
  and the forms  of  action  beginning with an equal sign are not
  supported.

I'm probably reading it wrong, though.

Exactly, there is no <name>, just a <value>.

Sorry for not being more clear. Emerge is the gentoo linux install
command. You can find out more about gentoo at www.gentoo.org.  There is a
manpage here: http://re.a.la/man/emerge/ What I am trying to add is listed
under the ebuild and dependency headers.

This could be a standalone argument, or it could follow one or more other
arguments (-p, --pretend, --update, etc...). 
emerge -p =gvim-6.3
emerge  =gvim-6.3
emerge --pretend --deep --buildpkg =gvim-6.3 
All valid commands as far as emerge is concerned.

The existing emerge completion is here: 
http://cpan.cybercomm.nl/pub/gentoo-portage/app-shells/zsh/files/_portage

If I insert this snippet (along with the _portage_ebuilds from my previous
example) into the above completion, --pretend works and lists all the
appropriate files, while = lists the normal ones.
 
 =|--pretend)
  _arguments -s \
     '*:install version:_portage_ebuilds' "$common_args[@]" && return 0
		;;

And just to clarify, I want regular emerge without an equal sign to
complete one list (fvwm, zsh, abiword...) and the emerge = to complete
exact versions (fvwm-2.5.10-r6, fvwm-2.4.18, zsh-4.2.0-r1, ...). So I
can't just replace the default behavior with the versioned packages.

Hope that clears things up. Thanks for looking at this.
