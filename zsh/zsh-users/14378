Ah $fpath was the hint I needed, thanks :)

$fpath only contained two paths, both from the icc (the intel C
compiler). Some faulty config file set them as a path instead of
appending them to the existing path. This was (indirectly) done by an
orphan /etc/profile.d/icc.sh; I don't remember if I wrote it myself or
if it is a remainder of an older icc installation. However, it looks
like this only screwed up bash, from which the virtual terminal
inherited the wrong paths (so su or a direct zsh login still work).

Long story short: Removing the orphan config file /etc/profile.d/icc.sh
solved the problem.

Thank you all!
