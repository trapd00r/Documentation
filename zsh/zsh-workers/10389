status -v <filename> will tell you if there is a sticky tag -
including sticky branch tag - or sticky date for a particular file.
It's pretty much up to you not to do anything foolish like check out
different files from different branches.

For the "checked out/updated at yyy" problem, I think the best
solution is for most people to use labeled versions, which shouldn't
be too onerous as long as folks are smart about creating new (and
cleaning up old and useless) labels.
