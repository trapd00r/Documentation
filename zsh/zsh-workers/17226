There's a discussion on debian-devel about a bunch of packages using
"command -v" in their scripts, which all debian POSIX shells support,
with the exception of zsh.  ("command -v" isn't in POSIX, apparently,
but it's in other standards.)

Anyway, probably zsh ought to support it, whatever it does.
