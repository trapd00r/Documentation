The bug has effect regardless of whether NUL is treated as a blank or
not.  I added the IBLANK etc. bits on the grounds that NUL ought to be
treated as a blank, just as it's in $IFS.  But the shell is indeed
perfectly usable either way, so I won't contest this issue.

Adding it to $IFS has no effect in this matter, because zsh does not do
field splitting on normal words.  (It should, at least if SH_WORD_SPLIT
is set.)
