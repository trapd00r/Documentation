} One more thing I noticed:
} 
} % echo foo !#<TAB>
} 
} fails silently and does ordinary completion instead.  This is not a
} result of this patch.

I think this has always been true, since the earliest zsh.  (Actually,
it may be that !# used to fail noisly with a history error, rather than
falling through to ordinary completion, but in any case it has never
worked as naively expected.)
