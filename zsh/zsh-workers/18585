Seems it won't work for _arguments where we have a '*' action which uses
a state. Currently _arguments assumes that something will be completed
for the state so doesn't offer options where prefix-needed is set and
that state completes nothing. _describe can't know if _arguments has
such a state. I can't think of any obvious way around this and haven't
really had time to tinker with _arguments in case there is some possible
hack.

So feel free to commit your _describe -o/-O thing. I'm sorry for holding
that up.
