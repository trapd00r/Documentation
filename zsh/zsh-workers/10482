Sorry, I committed that accidentally before I'd quite finished it, hence it
hasn't been documented.  Before it's ready for use I need to update it to
write the changes back to the file.  It's good enough for testing though;
it just outputs the changes to stdout.

The things that need doing are styles for files, in particular, things
consequent on particular styles like the bindkey for _expand and
completeinword for prefix, and in the long run maybe a way of setting
options (which should be simpler than styles).  In the even longer run
maybe the handling of contexts could be more intelligent, but I don't even
know how yet.

This sounds pretty good.
