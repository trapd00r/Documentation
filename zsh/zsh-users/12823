Hmm... the first thing I do with that is group it as 1001 1110 0001,
otherwise I can't count it.  So I end up with something that looks like
hex anyway.  But in that form it's six and two threes (which you don't
say in California, either; I'm told it's probably a Tyneside
peculiarity) whether I turn it into hex or count within the groups of
four.

You're quite right that I tend to think down at the lowest levels, but
actually in firmware terms rather than driver terms.  I'm used to things
like

enum fiddly_analogue_radio_bits {
  ANA_TWEAK_FOR_THE_STUFF_IN_THAT_OTHER_WOTSIT_LVL_MASK = 0x0f00
};

and bitmasks don't naturally lend themselves to individual powers of
two.  (See the new definitions for colour attributes in zsh.h for
examples.)
