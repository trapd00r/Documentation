On a different machine, zsh 4.3.2-25 (Debian stable), using the above
four-line .zshrc, works as I'd like.  By the way, there

dion% setopt
noequals
interactive
monitor
shinstdin
zle

On the system in question, currently I have Debian's 4.3.4-dev-3-2.
There I had no complaint with the versions up to to Debian's 4.3.4-26.
(According to my dpkg.log, the other versions I've had over the past year
are 4.3.4-{2,3,8,10,12,13,14,18,21,24}.)
