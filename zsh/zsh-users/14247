TextMate on the Mac has a handy feature: you can jump to the next word 
as always, with option-right-arrow, but you can also jump to the next 
word segment (CamelCase, under_score, hyphen-ated) with 
control-right-arrow. This solves the age old "which word boundaries do I 
care about more?" problem.

Is there a way to do something like this easily in zsh?  I'm on 4.3.6 
(but could upgrade to 4.3.10 if needed).
