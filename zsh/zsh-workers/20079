I've just been reconciling my local CVS repository of imported zsh source
with the repository on SourceForge, and there appear to be some patches
that I applied directly from zsh-workers postings that have never been
committed to SourceForge.

In particular, the documentation changes in builtins.yo and compsys.yo 
that correspond to the new "autoload -z" option, appear to be missing.
