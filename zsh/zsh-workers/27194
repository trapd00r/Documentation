I sent a message yesterday and got a temporary failure:

| Final-recipient: rfc822; zsh-workers@sunsite.dk
| Action: delayed
| Status: 4.1.1
| Diagnostic-Code: smtp;  451 4.3.5 Server configuration problem
| Last-attempt-Date: Tue, 28 Jul 2009 06:00:35 +0000

and the message has not yet been sent to the list, so this is just a
test message..
