} One can get the desired effect by using ${param[(r)${(q)anotherparam}]},
} but (another inconsistency) this works for arrays but fails for string
} subscription on scalars.  That's clearly a bug.

I have a fix for that now, too.  It failed only when the `*' was the last
character in $anotherparam, because the code that checked for whether to
append a `*' to the pattern failed to check that the next-to-last character
might be a backslash.
