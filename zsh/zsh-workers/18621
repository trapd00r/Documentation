Have you had any problems in the last week? Seems to have been better to
me.

There are alternatives if we wanted to move though. I expect sunsite.dk
would host it if we asked. CVS access for the web pages there works
fine. Also, last time the question of moving away from SourceForge came
up, there was an offer to host it at sources.redhat.com.
