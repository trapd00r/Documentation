} Running 'make test' as a normal user does not change the results.

Hmm.  Well, it's a pretty good bet that it's the [[ ! -r unmodish ]]
test that's failing.  Can you try it by hand?

Src/zsh -fs <<EOF
umask 077
touch unmodish
chmod 000 unmodish
[[ -r unmodish ]] && ls -l unmodish
EOF

This should of course produce no output; if it produces an "ls" listing
please mail it to the list.
