} This certainly is not perfect. A better solution would be to disallow

} without completely disabling correction.

My reservation about this is that the leading-underscore naming
convention is (1) just that, a convention, and (2) specific to this
implementation of the completion system -- the whole idea of putting
the completion system into shell code was to remove this kind of
dependency from the base shell and make it possible for anyone to
implement their own system (admittedly increasingly unlikely at
this point, but still).

A more general solution would be an fignore-type variable, which
compinit could set to the value "_*" or some such thing.
