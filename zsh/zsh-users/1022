i have a book about the ksh shell.

there is an example about coprocesses that i try to get done
with the zsh 3.0 without success:

coproc bc

print -p "23*34"

read -p erg
echo $erg


my zsh (linux 2.029) sticks with read -p erg.
nothing is moving.

the same thing is no problem with the zsh 3.1 at aix 4.1.

so i am asking: what could be the reason that i have problems at home.
perhaps wrong setopt variables set?
