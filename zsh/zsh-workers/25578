Can't count, make that 08090101.

Also, I meant to mention that is-at-least is fine for my needs as I
hope I indicated in my first reply. Alas, since ZSH_VERSION doesn't
change as quickly as I'd like, I still have to test for specific
features within 4.3.6-dev-0. But ZSH_VERSION is one of the features
tested using is-at-least.
