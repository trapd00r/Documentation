Hi all,
Just in case anyone else ever hits this "problem", the solution was to...

xmodmap -e "keysym Alt_L =3D Meta_L Alt_L"
xmodmap -e "keysym Alt_R =3D Meta_R Alt_R"

Cheers,
c

nope nothing.

ok, i'll go digging on google to see if i can find anything else
that xterm needs (other than eightBitInput: true).

thanks for the reply.
