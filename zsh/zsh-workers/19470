Now committed.

We should be in a position to start 4.2 test releases.  I will make a
4.2.0-pre-1 at some point.  (This means changing references to 4.1
in the documentation to 4.2.  I might easily miss some.)

Does anyone know of unresolved porting issues?  We get occasional reports
about weirdness with AIX and I don't know how we stand with the latest
code.  I don't think Etc/MACHINES is particularly up to date, either.
