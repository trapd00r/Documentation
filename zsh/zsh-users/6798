The command results from bash are simply wierd.

Using
GNU bash, version 2.05b.0(1)-release (powerpc-apple-darwin7.0)

ls /tmp -F
generates exactly the same output as does  zsh or tcsh  (all without 
initialization files).
               ls: -F: No such file or directory

The command syntax is
                ls [-ABCFGHLPRTWZabcdfghiklmnopqrstuwx1] [file ...]

The parameters are positional, with the options first and the operands 
second.
The "-F" is treated as a file name, hence "no such file."

This is true for both the BSD and SystemV versions of ls.
