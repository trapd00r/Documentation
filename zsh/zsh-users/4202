My sysadmin has done this, but I'm still not getting
notification at the shell.  I have this is .zshenv:

mailpref=$HOME/Mail
mailpath=($HOME/.mailspool/rj/
            $mailpref/z/'?New zsh mail.'
            $mailpref/m/'?New mutt mail.'
            $mailpref/trash/'?New mail in trash.')

do I need, e.g., "new" after ".mailspool/rj/" ?
