Subject: What would you say is the most-used way of indenting case labels
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1; format=flowed
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Content-Disposition: inline
X-Google-Sender-Auth: bb3c72a0ad556191

That is, is this style:

case something in
(*ome*)
  ... ;;
esac

more common than

case something in
  (*ome*)
    ... ;;
esac

I'm trying to set a default for a shell-script indentation script.

Thanks.
