:let me know where the list archives are, or alternatively summarise
:any important events since the 27th of June?  Please note the new email
:address: my Warwick address will shortly disappear.

http://www.peak.org/zsh/ should say somewhere.

Otherwise, try  http://www.primenet.com.au/zsh/    with the trailing slash

or if you're really desperate, you may be able to read the last couple of
months if you set your nntp server to  news.primenet.com.au .  The newsgroups
are  lists.zsh.announce , lists.zsh.users & list.zsh.workers
