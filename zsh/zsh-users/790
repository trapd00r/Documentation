Not at the moment.  It would be easy to tell it a different layout by
modifying the source (have a look at spdist() in utils.c).  Perhaps this
should become a special parameter, to allow for AZERTY and other odd
layouts.  This is the only part of zsh that actually needs to know the
keyboard layout.

As for using vi keybindings, looking at the Dvorak layout it seems that
the hjkl movement keys become exceptionally awkward, but I can't imagine
anything else being a problem.
