Subject: PATCH: ypmatch completion
Date: Thu, 15 Nov 2001 18:38:03 +0000
Message-ID: <27592.1005849483@csr.com>
From: Peter Stephenson <pws@csr.com>

The first of a couple of minor patches to get rid of before I produce
another development version.

After ypmatch, you can complete one or more keys, then a map name.  The
keys can't be completed, but the map can, so it's more useful to attempt to
complete maps after the first argument.  It could report the fact that a
key could appear, too, but I haven't bothered with that.
