Well, yes. I'd see a problem if zsh wouldn't install ssh completion
because there is no ssh installed (just because someone forgot to
install it), ssh gets installed later, and the completion is not there.
(anything besides ssh may be used as an example)
One could argue "then do a make install again", but what about people
who are low on disk space and just have deleted the source tree again?
Download again. Bad.

CU,
Thomas
