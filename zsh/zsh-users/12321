which is that in the traditional "test" command (not [[, which is parsed
properly),
  ( ! -e )
should be treated as
  ( ! -n -e )
which is horrible, but it's a horror we're already trying to work around so
presumably we ought to go the extra mile.

So
   -e )
tests for a file ')', right?  That's what GNU (standalone) test does.  That
means we need to know whether we're in parentheses, so we need an extra
global variable.

Furthermore, this change makes
  ( ! -e ) )
an error:  the first ) has to be parsed as a "real" closing parenthesis
otherwise the rule either becomes inconsistent or requires too much
lookahead.  I checked with GNU test and this is indeed what it does (it
reports an error), and since the shell's "test" is basically there just for
compatibility I suppose this is OK.  However, it doesn't thrill me.

Unfortunately,
  ( -e ) )
is parsed by GNU test as -e ")" in parentheses.  This is rather inconsistent
of it.  If you're happy that this is an error as the other one is, then I
have a working patch.  Otherwise we're a bit stuck.

What I don't have is a set of tests:  our test suite doesn't include many
tests for test or [.  This is a real nuisance, since it's quite likely this
changes something.  So I'll need to write something first (I presume no one
else is going to).
