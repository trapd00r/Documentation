Hi,

having used ZSH for years now, I've encountered a problem
when building ZSH (CVS 2005/01/29  - currently CVS is broken)
on a new system with glibc-2.3.4 .
Although the build looked perfectly normal,
the 'limit' command doesn't work anymore.

'limit' alone doesn't show anything
and ,e.g.,
limit stacksize 768M

gives 'unknown resource stacksize'

What am I missing, what might be the reason for this
and how can I find out / debug this.


Many thanks for your help,
