This is a slight problem with the command completion.....

	$ function 'sss ttt' () { echo $0 ; }
	$ sss<TAB>
	$ sss ttt
	zsh: command not found: sss
	$

When I hit the TAB key the completeion should be sss\ ttt. This
also happens when there is an executable file 'sss ttt' in the path.

Has this been reported and fixed before? 

This is for version 2.6-beta9 on SunOS 4.1.3.

			Anthony.
