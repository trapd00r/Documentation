Subject: joining array elements
Date: Thu, 12 Jan 2006 10:22:48 +0900
X-Mailer: Apple Mail (2.746.2)

Hi all,

I am trying to join array elements together using a string separator  
containing square brackets.  For example, if I have,

usernames=( Bob Sara Tim )

I would like,

Bob[return]Sara[return]Tim

as an output (without the backslashes in front of the square  
brackets).  I started out with,

echo ${(j:\[return\]:)usernames}

and added extra backslashes, but that did not work for me.  Help is  
greatly appreciated.

Wataru Kagawa
