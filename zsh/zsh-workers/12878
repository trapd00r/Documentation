Anything that makes a query against the repository should respect the
remote-access style, the way _cvs_revisions does.  You handled that in
_cvs_(top|sub)_modules but not in _cvs_vendor_branches.

Hmm; it seems as though the remote-access should be documented somewhere,
and maybe respected in some other (non-CVS) completion functions as well.
(I'm not suggesting Tanaka needs to do either of those.)
