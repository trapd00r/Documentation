} These worked, right?  Else I'm missing something.

They worked.  I closed out the bug report on SourceForge.

} This looks like another header problem, but this time it's more than just
} configure complaining.  struct rlimit64 should be defined:
[...]
} 5.8 system.  The complaints are presumbably from the lines
} 
}   extern int setrlimit64(int, const struct rlimit64 *);
}   extern int getrlimit64(int, struct rlimit64 *);

Your header certainly makes it appear that it shouldn't be possible to
compile the above two lines without also having rlimit64 defined.  I've
already sent mail to Jason asking what his resource.h looks like (and
he's Cc'd on this message).
