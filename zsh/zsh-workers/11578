} I was thinking about the command substitution problem and keeping file

} zftp.c, which is the only place it's used (could we do with some more?)

There's already some pretty elaborate code in exec.c to close all the fds
that should be closed on exec; probably you don't even need that stuff in
zftp, but it doesn't hurt.
