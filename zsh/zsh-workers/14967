Looks like your awk isn't up to it.  I don't understand the first error ---
can't use subscripted variables?  but the second set appear to be because
gsub is mssing.  NextStep 3.* was supposed to build out of the box,
according to MACHINES.  I wonder if it's related to the following?

Apple/NeXT OpenStep 4.2 for i386.
	Reported to work at least with gcc 2.8.1 and gawk 2.15 patchlevel
	6, but not with the bundled cc 2.7.2.1 and awk.

Are you able to try with gawk (or any other Xawk for non-empty X)?
