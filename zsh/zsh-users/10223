Surely this is because the match is ambiguous?  It doesn't know whether
you want INSTALL or Install.bin and has to pick the characters from one
or other.  You will need some other feature of zsh, such as
menucompletion, to fix that.  With my settings (with menucompletion) it
shows me InsTALL which is a sign it hasn't resolved what it's completing
yet.  (I was trying this with the new completion system, however.)
