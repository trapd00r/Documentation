I have ttyctl -f, not because I'm terribly clever, but because it came 
from a sample somewhere in a zsh distribution.

I do see that stty may not be the best solution in some cases, e.g., 
remote logins may need  ^?, while local logins may need ^h, or v.v.  To 
me it is better to detect the source and use stty.  The function 
solution to me is a bit too brittle.  You can make a reasonable argument 
for either solution.

Yes, you'd need to unfreeze it before the stty to be sure.  I suspect
most users haven't got the tty frozen.
