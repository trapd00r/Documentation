One possible solution would be

sudo() {
	... add sudo options parsing here that sets sudo_options and
sudo_command...
	command sudo $sudo_options zsh -c "$sudo_command"
}

with obvious caveat that you have to modify sudoers to account for =
this.=20

Extension to zsh makes no sense as sudo is started as external process =
that
you have no control of.
