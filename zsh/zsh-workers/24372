I've uploaded 4.3.4-dev-7 to

ftp://ftp.zsh.org/pub/development/zsh-4.3.4-dev-7.tar.gz

This fixes a few bugs, some potentially quite serious, while there are
some completion tweaks, none far-reaching.

It would be nice to understand Clint's problems with the termcap
library, but everything else can wait till after 4.3.5.
