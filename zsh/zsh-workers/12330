I just installed zsh and am very impressed by its configurability and speed.
In a number of different places I've seeen references to zsh being bloated,
one person on slashdot claimed it to be more bloated than bash.  Even on the
online documentation there are a few references to it not being "small".
 
I'm running FreeBSD, which comes by default with sh and tcsh.  Here I compare
it to those two, and some others:
 
% du /bin/sh /bin/tcsh /usr/local/bin/bash /usr/local/bin/ksh /usr/local/bin/zsh
 
440	/bin/sh
592	/bin/tcsh
736	/usr/local/bin/bash
328	/usr/local/bin/ksh
352	/usr/local/bin/zsh
 
Zsh shows itself to be smaller than all the others, with the exception of
ksh, and vastly smaller than bash.  Unless I am missing something, zsh
seems quite the opposite of bloat.  With all its awesome features, how can 
it be done?
 
Please cc me in your reply, for I am not subscribed.
