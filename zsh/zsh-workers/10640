I'm sure what you say is right but 'before' seems clearer to me. Would
it maybe be clearer if the doc said 'Duplicate the word to the left of
the cursor'. I wouldn't particularly consider the left to be behind the
right because it is no further away and isn't obscured by it. I agree
with Andrej in finding 'before the cursor' more understandable.
