A combination of a), b) and d).  You've turned on vi mode and the way
you currently have things initialised you would need to add them by
hand; but if you hadn't been so busy worrying about O.J. Simpson, you
might have noticed that if you set vi mode before running compinit the
bindings will be there.  In other words,

bindkey -v
autoload -U compinit
compinit

ought to make keys of that sort work.
