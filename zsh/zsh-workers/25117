You must "zmodload zsh/complist" before compinit.
In zshcompsys manpage, section "Use of compinit", it says:

  If you  use  the
  menu-select  widget,  which  is  part  of  the zsh/complist module, you
  should make sure that that module is loaded before the call to compinit
  so  that  that  widget  is  also re-defined.

Yes.
I don't know why it works if you start "zsh -f" and then "source .zshrc".
