} Your subject line implies this is something new, but it isn't.

I didn't know whether it was new or not, but I've concluded lately
that I ought to mention when I encountered a bug so that people
using later builds aren't confused.  This is one of the drawbacks
of using the mailing list to report bugs rather than having a 
tracking system where they can be marked resolved.  (No, I'm not
suggesting we change.)

} I didn't seem to get this effect.

The way I noticed the trouble in the first place was that once I set a
list-prompt style I always got the scrolling display, even after I'd
supposedly deleted the style.

} It would have to be a different bug,

You're right, it is.  Now the style goes away, but complist continues
to have the scrolling behavior.

Also now there's no way to get the style back again:

schaefer<501> zstyle ":completion:*:default" list-prompt ''
schaefer<502> zstyle | grep list-prompt
list-prompt
schaefer<503> zstyle -d  ":completion:*:default" list-prompt
schaefer<504> zstyle | grep list-prompt
schaefer<505> zstyle ":completion:*:default" list-prompt "Go On"
schaefer<506> zstyle | grep list-prompt
schaefer<507> echo $?
1
schaefer<508> 

And yet I if I invoke completion after 502, then I still get the list
displayed scrolling after 508.
