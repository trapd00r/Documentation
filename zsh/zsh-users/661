I'd agree here.  When the dynamic loading and programmable zle stuff is
in, I'd have thought a book would be worthwhile.  Has anybody who
actually understands all of zsh looked into publisher interest in such
a thing?  The manual is pretty good, but it's still a bit referency.
The intro was pretty good, the last time I looked at it, but I'd pay
money for a full-length book covering the whole thing (especially once
the important new features have settled down a bit---if the dynamic
loading could be made compatible with ksh93's, and if it could drag in
Tk (perhaps not just yet, but when some future version of Tk is more
language independent), then surely that would sell).

(On PDF.)  I don't see that much need for pictures.  If they're needed,
Texinfo can do them (you can put arbitrary TeX into the printed
version, and give other text (perhaps a character version of the
picture) for the online version.  Presumably the texinfo2html converter
can do pictures, or could easily be hacked to do them.  Presumably yodl
can also do something that allows access to these features, or could
easily be extended to do so.

Really?  I've never found myself doing that.  If it's such a big thing,
you could customize emacs to do that, assuming you're using emacs.  I
couldn't really recommend the standalone info reader---there's
something of a need for a nice up to date X-based reader.

That's true, but it's deliberate.  I don't need menus in my printed
manual, but they're very useful when reading online.  Pictures are a
bit of a problem, but presumably not for zsh?  Personally, I'd hate
PDF-only manuals: Adobe's Acrobat reader is slow, pretty unreadable,
and generally clunky, especially compared with info in Emacs.  And I've
never found printing with it to be particularly successful
either---horribly slow, horribly big PostScript files.

What's "FrameMaker"?  Should I have heard of it?   If it's commercial,
then I think zsh should avoid requiring it, including for development,
but certainly for use.
