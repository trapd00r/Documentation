The only updates I have done are updating the FAQ.... I haven't had time
for anything else due to school and other volunteer efforts.

Speaking of which:  Graduation is in May.  I can guarantee that I'll be
around until the end of June, but after that the ZSH homepages will need a
new home site.

I saw a message on zsh-workers of a new distribution site for new
releases.... perhaps the pages could be moved there?  I can make a tarball
of what I have and ftp them from PEAK if someone wants to take over.
