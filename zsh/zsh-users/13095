"struct winsize" is used throught the zsh source; this suggests that it's
not being defined in this case because of different code options.  The
obvious candidate is _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED, which has caused problems on
other systems.

The best I can think of is therefore to turn that off, which requires
rebuilding configure.  Not defining _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED might have side
effects in curses.

If it's not easy to track down what's going on, it might simply want to set
the "link=no" against the zsh/curses line in config.modules and run "make
prep" before compiling so as not to compile zsh/curses.  It's not currently
required by anything else.
