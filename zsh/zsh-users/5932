Subject: umask for process substitution
X-Mailer: VM 7.07 under Emacs 21.2.1

Is there a way to set umask for temporary file created with =(cmd)?  I
am running a setuid program which failed to read the =(cmd) because it
use mode 600:

> ls =(echo foo)
-rw-------    1 root  other    4 Feb 20 13:32 /tmp/zsh8PayQ4

> umask
002

TIA.
