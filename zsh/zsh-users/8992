Hi all ;),

I've installed zsh from CVS to see if it was usable with utf-8 support. zle works pretty
well, widgets like backward-delete-char now do the right thing. But i got frequent segmentation
faults with completion. Is it this a known problem?

Anyway thanks the developers for adding support for utf-8 :)

regards,
