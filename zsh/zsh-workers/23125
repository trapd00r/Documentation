The problem is somewhere here (in lex.c).  If dquote_parse() returns
non-zero it's an error indication, not a character, so the hungetc(c) is
definitely wrong in that case.  However, I don't understand the
intention behind error handling at this point.  I think we probably need
to return 1 earlier.


static int
cmd_or_math(int cs_type)
{
    int oldlen = len;
    int c;

    cmdpush(cs_type);
    c = dquote_parse(')', 0);
    cmdpop();
    *bptr = '\0';
    if (!c) {
	c = hgetc();
	if (c == ')')
	    return 1;
	hungetc(c);
	lexstop = 0;
	c = ')';
    }
    hungetc(c);
    lexstop = 0;
    while (len > oldlen) {
	len--;
	hungetc(itok(*--bptr) ? ztokens[*bptr - Pound] : *bptr);
    }
    hungetc('(');
    return 0;
}
