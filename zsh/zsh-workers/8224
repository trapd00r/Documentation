        For some reason, it looks like configure has set CPP to the
literal string "'cc -E'".  Since you probably don't have a copy of cpp 
(or anything else :) named 'cc -E' sh is complaining.  One kludge to
get it working would be to look in the generated Makefile and see if
there are extra ''s around where CPP is set and try removing them.
