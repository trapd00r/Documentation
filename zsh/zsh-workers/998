The new features which appeared in beta17 are not quite new.  They were in
my releases almost from the beginning (which was more than a year ago).

These new features are not really big features.  All of them was very
simple to implement.  Some new features appeared automatically when I
cleaned up the code (eg. the feature that zsh can now handle the null
character in strings is such a side effect).  I dared to add these new
features into beta17 because my earlier releases were used by several
people and noone complained about them.  To be more precise some complained
about not globbing assignments but that's not a new feature it is just the
right way.

I do not plan to add really new features to zsh.  I'd like stable
`production release' as soon as possible since the last `stable' release
has probably much more bugs than the current beta.

Cheers,

Zoltan
