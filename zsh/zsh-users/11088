I've nothing against it being included, but I suspect there's
more work to be done in order for it to work with UTF8.

I'm also not very happy with the X selection/clipboard side of
it.

There's plenty of room for tidy up and rationalisation.
clipboard selection and mouse handling should probably be made
separate.

Cheers,
Stéphane
