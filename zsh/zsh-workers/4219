This is a classic shared library failure.  Chances are that your login shell
is setting LD_LIBRARY_PATH or otherwise initializing the shared library
search locations, but that the init file (e.g. ~/.zlogin) that performs this
task is not being executed when you start other shells.

It's best to move such initialization code to ~/.zshenv, which is executed
by every zsh that you start.
