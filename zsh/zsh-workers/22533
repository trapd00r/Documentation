zsh% cvs up -rzsh-4_2-patches
cvs [update aborted]: missing expected branches in /cvsroot/zsh/zsh/Completion/Base/Utility/_combination,v

I removed that file and the update was then able to proceed, but I got a
lot of stuff like this:

C Completion/X/Command/.distfiles
RCS file: /cvsroot/zsh/zsh/Completion/X/Command/_acroread,v
retrieving revision 1.4
retrieving revision 1.4.2.1
Merging differences between 1.4 and 1.4.2.1 into _acroread
rcsmerge: warning: conflicts during merge

P Functions/Zftp/zfanon
cvs update: checksum failure after patch to Functions/Zftp/zfanon; will refetch

I've never seen these kinds of problems when updating an unmodified CVS
sandbox trunk <-> branch, before.
