This would seem to be quite a serious bug, although it could be e.g. NFS
which is known not always to respect time ordering.  I've added the patch
but it deserves watching.

I've also committed the array patches.  There's no point releasing a
bug-fix version until we know what's going on with Irix, and I have no
ideas whatsoever at the moment.  We might as well try these out in the
meanwhile.

Wayne, if you want to be added to the developers' list at sourceforge, let
me know a user name.
