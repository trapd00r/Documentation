I've uploaded this to the main archive.
  ftp://ftp.zsh.org/pub/zsh/development/zsh-3.1.6-dev-14.tar.gz
(note the change of naming convention as already signalled).

Changes are as follows.  There are minor things which won't quite tally
with Tanaka Akira's CVS archive, since I added some patchless suggestions
by hand.  There were also a few extra lines of offset when applying some of
Sven's patches from earlier this week, but nothing actually failed.
