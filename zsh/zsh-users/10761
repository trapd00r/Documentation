rm -rf mc-4.6.1*(/)

The "-f" option to "rm" will take care of the
warnings.

When NULL_GLOB is set (as it is when using the "N" glob qualifier), the shell
*deletes from the command line* any pattern which generates no match.

Your command becomes:

ls -ld

which prints the entry for the current directory (".") as expected.

No you wouldn't. Your command would become:

rm -rf

which does nothing.
