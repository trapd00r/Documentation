    will a person in charge of this please fix the ezmlm so that it
    doesn't

    1. possibly break RFC 2821
    2. anonymize spammers and other dorks

    by removing all Received: headers from the message before sending it
    out to the list subscribers?

If you cc me or remove the list(s) completely I'll most likely ignore
your message.    see http://www.eyrie.org./~eagle/faqs/questions.html
