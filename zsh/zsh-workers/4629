} Using a stock zsh-3.1.5, there seems to be some problem with completion
} using one interpretation of a directory tree with symlinks, and cd using
} another.

This isn't new.  It behaves the same way in 3.0.5.  `setopt chaselinks'
will make the effect go away.

There is one difference between 3.0.5 and 3.1.5 with chaselinks; here's
3.0.5:

zagzig[45] cd /tmp/test/bar
zagzig[46] pwd
/tmp/test/foo/bar
zagzig[47] print -P %~
/tmp/test/bar

Now 3.1.5:

zagzig<22> cd /tmp/test/bar
zagzig<23> pwd
/tmp/test/foo/bar
zagzig<24> print -P %~
/tmp/test/foo/bar

Apparently chaselinks didn't affect prompt expansion in 3.0.5, but does
in 3.1.5.  This may (?) have something to do with un-special-izing $PWD.
