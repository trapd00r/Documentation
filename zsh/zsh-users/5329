Hi there,

it appears hostname completion for ssh/scp/... in stock 4.0.x is quite
lacking. (See thread started by <87it4l7vcy.fsf@lexx.delysid.org> for an
example of people getting it on par with the rest of the completion
system.)

For the time being I'm going to use the zstyle posted by B. Schaefer,
but it'd be uber-cool if zsh had host completion for these commands
using ~/.ssh/known_hosts(|2) in the stock distribution.
