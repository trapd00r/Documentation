Subject: PATCH: MH for Mailboxes (TM)
Date: Fri, 23 Mar 2001 17:22:19 +0000
From: Peter Stephenson <pws@csr.com>

This makes _mailboxes a bit happier about MH mailboxes.  I don't know
whether to alter _mh_cache directly or change it at the point of use.  The
other change is to allow subfolders, which are already handled by
_multi_parts where _mh_cache is used.

It still doesn't handle the feature of MH (which I don't suppose anyone
actually uses) that @folder is relative to the last folder you were looking
at.  This is why I tacked the + directly on the front, rather than assuming
it's already present in the context --- it may in principle be an @.  But
in some ways it's more natural to forget about the + and assume it's
somewhere in the ignored prefix if it's needed.  MH itself is completely
consistent about requiring + or @, so far as I know, so either way would
probably work.

It's not wired up to _mh.  It's probably more than my job's worth to commit
this.
