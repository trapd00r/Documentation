This tests for the two trap problems we had recently, TRAPZERR triggering
too often and localtraps causing a crash --- that's why I'm using `unset -f
TRAPZERR' as in the problem seen, rather than the more usual `trap -
ZERR'.

Maybe we need an option to recognise ERR as an alias for ZERR on machines
which don't have a SIGERR.
