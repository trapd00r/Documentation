Subject: _cvs(&_arguments) bug

There is a bug with the _cvs completion functions.  Though, I would also
say it is also bug in _arguments.

The problem occurs with the functions _cvs_update & _cvs_checkout.
The problem is that the "-A" flag does not get completed for these
sub-commands, when it should be.  The reason is that the intended "-A"
specification is being interpreted as a flag to _arguments, rather than
as a specification.

The fix is easy for the _cvs_* functions; just move the intended -A
specifications from the front of the list.

Though, I think _arguments should also be modified to provide a way to say that
there is an end to the flags being given to _arguments, and the specifications
are starting.  It's an easy mistake to make.

-FR.
