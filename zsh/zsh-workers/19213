Subject: $pipestatus broken
Date: Sun, 02 Nov 2003 12:23:48 +0100
Message-ID: <1233.1067772228@athlon>

The pipestatus array seems to be broken:

% ls|cat -|cat - >/dev/null
% echo $pipestatus
0

% false
% echo $pipestatus
0

Seems to occur on both branches. I've not really used pipestatus before
so perhaps I'm missing something.
