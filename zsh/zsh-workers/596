Yes, sorry.  I completely misstated the behavior I was seeing.  What
you describe is what I'm getting, and I am using one of Zoltan's
releases.

However, I don't like the behaviour your patch produces.  I want cd to
be able to swap the top two dirs, just like pushd does.  After all,
the way I interpret AUTO_PUSHD is like the manual says: `Make cd act
like pushd.'

Obviously, it's not that big a deal; I can alias cd to pushd if I
want.  But if this is going to be the behavior of cd with AUTO_PUSHD
set, then it should be documented in zshoptions.1.

Thanks,
Danek
