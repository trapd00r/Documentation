Subject: zsh-4.04 and w3m browser
Date: Wed, 28 Aug 2002 07:23:30 -0400
From: Arthur Alinovi <aalinovi@panix.com>

I have just started using zsh-4.04 and am having some problems with the
w3m text based web browser.

If I copy a url, then type:

w3m <paste url I copied>

zsh comes back with:

zsh: no matches found: <url I pasted>

Is there a way around this, or do I constantly have to switch into ksh
before using w3m?

Thanks
