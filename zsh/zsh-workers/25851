I just noticed a problem with completion using braces that has
apparently been around since at least June.  Here's the recipe to
reproduce:

zsh -f
$ touch abcdef abcdefg abcghi
$ ls abc{d<TAB>  ==>
$ ls abc{def

as it should.

autoload -U compinit
compinit

$ ls abc{d<TAB>  ==>
$ ls abcdef{

which is not correct.

This is under cygwin on windows.  I can reproduce this problem with a
zsh built on 2008-06-17, but a zsh built on 2008-01-02 does not
exhibit this problem.

Let me know if you need any more info to reproduce this problem.

  - Vin
