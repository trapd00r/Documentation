} May be it is too late, but NEWS for current CVS autoconf says:

} - Remembers environment variables when reconfiguring.

We can't rely on unreleased versions of autoconf unless we're going to

to keep it up to date.

We can copy tests from the latest autoconf into aclocal.m4, though, if
we think they're better than the ones we already do.
