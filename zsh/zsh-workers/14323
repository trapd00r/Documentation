A thought that occurred to me, though I don't know if this is actually the
problem Paul is having:

/********************************************/
/* Defintions for word code                 */
/********************************************/

typedef unsigned int wordcode;
typedef wordcode *Wordcode;


There are architectures where `unsigned int' is 16 bits or 64 bits.  We
should be determining a 32-bit type via configure and using it here.
