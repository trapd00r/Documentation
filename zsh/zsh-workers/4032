No, plenty of `real' sh's choke on that construct.  We cater to
idiosyncracies of Bourne shell variants right back to V6 (hence no shell
functions); bash now counts as such a variant, though it doesn't seem
to have any special restrictions not present in any earlier sh.

With me, it's a case of "I know it works in practice, but does it work
in theory?".
