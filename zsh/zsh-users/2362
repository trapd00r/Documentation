I'm no zsh developer really so my opinion shouldn't count for much,
but I'm with Stefan here.  3.0.x is really quite old now and I know
that there is some really nice stuff in 3.1.x which I would rather see
released in stable form at the expense of maintaining 3.0.x.  Then
again, it may be that there's still a while to go before 3.1.x
approaches stability?  In which case, forget everything I said :-)
