Unfortunately all the tokens in zsh.h are defined as ((char) 0x83)
etc. etc., so it's a huge amount of work to make it use unsigned
characters; virtually every use of tokens in the shell requires that
something that began as a char *not* be cast to unsigned.

Historically, the integer value at this point was a simple char; it's
only because of the need to use functions for multibyte characters that
it got changed.  It's probably easy enough to put convchar_t back to
char instead of int when there's no multibyte code, but that doesn't
really gain anything.
