Hello:

Thanks for your help getting wildcards in my path.  I was wondering how I
might be able to use them so that they are added to my path iff they
existed.  We have a very heterogenous environment here and certain
directories (like /opt) exist on some of the machines.  Otherwise, the
non-existence causes the expansion to barf out.  I'd rather it fail
silently somehow to allow the sourcing of my environment to continue.

Thanks,

-Clint
