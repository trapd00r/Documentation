It looks like it, but it isn't.  I didn't change the old code here, and
this feature is in 4.2.  I was going by the manual:

     %<string<
     %>string>
     %[xstring]
...
          If the string is longer than the  specified  truncation
          length,  it  will  appear in full, completely replacing
          the truncated string.

which is unambiguous, so I presume there is a bug in the old code.  Even
more confusingly, it does the following (in both 4.2 and the non-multibyte
code):

% print -P '%10<0123456789<truncated at 10'
0123456789
% print -P '%10>0123456789abcde>truncated at 10'
0123456789
% print -P '%10<0123456789abcdef<truncated at 10'
truncated at 100

May be I should rewrite the code in the other branch to be more like the
code I just added.  Unless anyone wants to argue the manual is wrong?  (The
last output is certainly a bug.)  I suspect it's too minor to worry much
about and I should just fix the old code.  The only time I can think of
where this is significant is if you have a string with a variable
truncation length or truncation indicator so can't guarantee in advance
this won't happen, which must be fairly unlikely.
