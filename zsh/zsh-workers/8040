} _tar can't handle reading from tar archives if the archive name begins with
} a ~.  The following handles it the simplest way, but there are still
} possible quoting problems.

Has anyone checked that "emulate -L zsh" is used in all the completion
functions where it is necessary?  A grep finds it in only eight of them,
*not* including _arguments -- I can't believe ksharrays isn't going to
bite somebody at some point, if nothing else.
