    Hi Stephane :)

    That is Single Unix Specification, not POSIX, am I wrong?

    Oh, additional sequences, not POSIX ones. Ok, then :)

    The GNU printf says in its info manual that '\0ooo' is
interpreted as an octal number, but doesn's say anything about \ooo
where the 'o' are octal digits. It barfs in your example saying that
'\3' is not a valid escape sequence :(( I notified and got fixed a
bug about GNU printf argument handling a time ago, for not being SuS
compliant. Don't know the current status of SuS compliance that GNU
shell utilities have :??? Wait for GNU coreutils.

    BTW, as far as I know, zsh has not a printf builtin.
