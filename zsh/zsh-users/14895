I don't see where that would cause a problem, so I'd be interested in a
backtrace---the only place I can see it going wrong is within strtoul().
I'll have a go under that configuration when I get home, but I didn't
get it with a quick go on a 64-bit machine here; I get an ERANGE
everywhere, which means the strtoul() returned an error.  If it didn't,
we got an unsigned long which we converted to time_t, and there's not a
lot left to go wrong.

(I'm not really interested in anyone else's reports unless they can shed
more light on it.)
