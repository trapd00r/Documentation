Ok, you get one more comment.

How about making the leading underscore (or two) a convention for widget
functions, so that `compctl -K __foo` spots the leading underscores and
causes __foo to be taken as a widget function?

In the same vein, we could make the output of `functions` suppress the
display of any function whose name begins with an (or two) underscore(s),
after the manner of files beginning with `.', unless some special flag
was given.
