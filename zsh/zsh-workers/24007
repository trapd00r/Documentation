Thanks for looking...

The obvious cause is some allocation error in promptexpand().  However,
I can't see any sign of it.  We allocate 256 bytes initially, which is
bound to be enough for the string being expanded there.  (I see one
thing that worried me a bit that I've fixed but I don't think that can
possibly be related.)

The only other possibility I can see locally is that (columns - 1 -
!hasxn) is returning a negative width that's having a bad effect, but
it should simply change the effect of the alignment.

Or maybe "shout" has got into some unusable state.  I suppose it's not
unreasonable to test it's not NULL, although it's rather paranoid.

Otherwise it's presumably a knock-on effect from some other part of the
code.
