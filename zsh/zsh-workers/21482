 Each command argument of the form `<(LIST)', `>(LIST)' or `=(LIST)' is
 subject to process substitution.  In the case of the < or > forms, the
 shell runs process LIST asynchronously.  If the system supports the
 /dev/fd mechanism, the command argument is the name of the device file
 corresponding to a file descriptor; otherwise, if the system supports
 named pipes (FIFOs), the command argument will be a named pipe.

So evidently your system does not support /dev/fd, and zsh is having
some trouble managing the named pipe.  What version of zsh?  What
happens if you try

    echo <(sleep 2; date)

??

I can't reproduce your error, but all the systems to which I have access
are systems that support /dev/fd.
