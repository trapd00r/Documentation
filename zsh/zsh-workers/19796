btw. i found the segfault causing bug.

zstyle ':completion:*' matcher-list '' 'm:{a-z-}={A-Z_} r:|[-_./]=* r:|=*' \
'm:{a-z-}={A-Z_} l:|=* r:|=*'

does evil things. that came from sven wischnowsky.
zstyle ':completion:*' matcher-list '' 'm:{a-z-}={A-Z_}' 'r:|[-_./]=* r:|=*' \
'm:{a-z-}={A-Z_} l:|=* r:|=*'

(http://www.w9y.de/zsh/zshrc) 
he did this zshrc because sven guckes and i begged for it :)
he just said that he does not want it to be a link because sometimes he wants
to do it better.

i did not see what exactly has caused the segfault as my other computer
has the exact same line but does _not_ segfault.


i tell you if i find out!
