The trouble with wait is that it will wait for all the jobs to finish - there is no way to get it to wait for the first job to finish so you are setting 4 jobs off, waiting for them all to finish and doing the next 4 instead of doing the next each time a job finishes. Your solution is certainly nice and simple but it won't utilise multiple processors as well. If all the jobs are going to take roughly similar time then this makes less of a difference.
