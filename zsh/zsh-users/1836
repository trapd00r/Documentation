:Just a reminder that you should be referencing that by its official
:archive number 3797 - (from the X-Mailing-List line) and you can now
:search on numbers (though from the index you might get slight
:inaccuracies - e.g. too many matches) - because the msg numbers may
:change if for some rare reason it's reindexed (usually only latter
:numbers may change if, say, a spam delete occurs.)

Having said that,
	http://www.zsh.org/mla/workers/bynum/3797
is the static reference for the HTML version.  You can now also retrieve
by official number from the main MLA index page
	http://www.zsh.org/mla/

NB: at the moment, updates of .../bynum/  and the database for searching
    are irregular, though the browsable one is automatic.
