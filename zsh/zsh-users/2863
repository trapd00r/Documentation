	Hi, first time writing to the list (just subscribed)...

	I would like to know if there is *any* way to make zsh complete
filenames that include spaces; that is, after a first completion up to a
"with-spaces" point pressing <tab> completes nothing, while pressing <tab>
if no spaces were in the previuos completion works perfectly.

	Thanks.
