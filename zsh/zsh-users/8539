Solved. I had following defination in my .zshrc:

export foo=3D"/home/bar/project/random/"

Problem was slash at end of directory, following works great:

export foo=3D"/home/bar/project/random"

Both work with cd, but only later expand correctly from %~.=20
Unfortunatly instead of realizing that right away I walk through the=20
hard way. First I made some tests on other platforms (with different=20
config files) and it worked there, so I thought that maybe platform is=20=

reason to faulty behaviour. Because of my blindness to see obivious I=20
had to run zsh under gdb on two different platforms to see that little=20=

difference :)
