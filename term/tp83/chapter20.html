<P CLASS="chapterhead">Chapter 20</P>
<H1 CLASS="chapterhead">Customer Services</H1>
<H2>Field Service</H2>
<P>Digital recognizes how much your business or organization relies on terminals
and printers. Terminals and printers enable you to get information to and from your
computer system, and if they are unavailable, productivity decreases. That's why at
Digital, terminal and printer product support is a process that begins long before
you make your purchase.</P>
<H3>Quality Assurance</H3>
<P>We build our terminals and printers to be reliable right from the start. Product
designs are tested for reliability and maintainability. And extensive testing
continues throughout the manufacturing process to ensure that you can depend on the
high quality of Digital's products.</P>
<P>All of Digital's terminals and printers come with warranty coverage. And, during
the warranty period, the same Field Service organization that will support you after
warranty provides complete service. Be sure to read your warranty carefully since
terms may vary depending on your location. For more detailed information on your
warranty coverage, you can contact your nearest Digital Field Service office.</P>
<H3>Field Service Organization</H3>
<P>To support your terminals and printers after warranty, Digital has one of the
largest Field Service organizations in the world. Over 16,000 people work in more
than 400 service locations around the world, supporting a wide variety of customer
applications &#8211; day after day. And because Digital provides the widest range
of services in the industry, you get just the support you need, without paying for
more services than you want.</P>
<P>You can choose from 24-hour-a-day onsite service for critical applications to
self-maintenance support &#8211; and everything in between.</P>
<H3>Onsite Service Agreements</H3>
<P>Digital lets you choose the onsite service plan that's right for you. Both our
DECservice&#8482; and Basic Service Agreements bring service to your computer site.
Both include an automatic product update program and, if applicable, a rigorous
preventative maintenance program to identify potential problems before they can
affect system productivity. And both include all parts and labor in a single monthly
charge &#8211; so you can plan for service costs and budget for them accordingly.</P>
<H4>Lineprinters</H4>
<P>Because lineprinters are a vital part of your system's performance, they are
covered as part of that system.</P>
<H4>Terminals</H4>
<P>Terminals may be covered either as stand-alone equipment under their own
agreement, or as part of a larger system, under a total system agreement.</P>
<H4>DECservice</H4>
<P>DECservice is Digital's most comprehensive hardware service offering. Coverage ranges
from normal business hours up to 24 hours a day, 7 days a week for more critical
applications.</P>
<H5>Defined Response Time</H5>
<P>With DECservice, Digital commits to a response time, in writing, as part of your
service agreement. Worldwide response times may vary. In the United States, if your
computer site is within 100 miles of one of Digital's 400 service locations, Digital
will commit that a service representative will arrive at your site within four hours
of receiving a call during normal coverage hours. If a site is between 100 to 200
miles from a Digital service location, we will commit to eight-hour response; and if
a site is more than 200 miles from a Digital service location, a representative will
arrive within 16 hours. Elsewhere, Digital still commits to a specific response time,
which is directly related to the distance between your location and your nearest
Digital Servicenter.</P>
<P>Whatever the distance, Digital's service vans help ensure that a representative
arrives with the parts needed to fix your terminal or printer &#8211; right on the
spot. These specially-equipped mobile inventory units provide complete service for
onsite customers.</P>
<H5>Continuous Repair Effort</H5>
<P>What's more, with DECservice, service doesn't stop until the problem is fixed
&#8211; as long as you call us during coverage hours and immediately after equipment
failure.</P>
<H5>Automatic Problem Escalation</H5>
<P>In the event that repair efforts exceed predefined time limits, our Automatic
Problem Escalation program goes into effect. Digital Field Service technicians have
technical support teams to call on &#8211; or call in &#8211; to help with difficult
problems. This support network is in place, the procedure for using it is clearly
defined, and your Field Service representative will keep you informed every step of
the way.</P>
<H5>Automatic Updates</H5>
<P>To keep your terminal and printer products reliable and compatible with the latest
capabilities, engineering changes, updates, or modifications made to your terminal or
printer are automatically installed &#8211; at no extra charge. These changes help
maintain the value of your terminals and printers by keeping them technically
compatible with the latest models.</P>
<H4>Basic Service</H4>
<P>Basic Service was designed as an economical alternative for customers who want
onsite support, but who do not have the critical needs to warrant DECservice.</P>
<P>Basic Service customers receive priority over customers not covered by service
agreements. With Basic Service, a Field Service Specialist is usually at your site
within 24 hours.</P>
<P>Like DECservice, Basic Service provides all parts and labor, preventative
maintenance, automatic updates, and automatic problem escalation.</P>
<H4>Per Call Service</H4>
<P>For self-maintenance customers who want onsite back-up support or for customers
who prefer service on a time and material basis, Digital offers per call onsite
service. Customers who opt for service on a per call basis may maintain their
terminal and printer products and have the technical know-how to do most of their own
repairs. Per Call customers pay for parts and labor on an as-needed basis. Travel is
charged door-to-door.</P>
<H3>Offsite Services</H3>
<P>Digital also offers a range of economical offsite services. Offsite service
provides Digital-quality service while saving the costs of bringing a service
technician onsite.</P>
<H4>Carry-In Service</H4>
<P>There are more than 200 Digital Servicenters in cities worldwide where you can
bring your terminal or printer for repair. We will diagnose and repair the problem
and, in most cases, you can pick the unit up the next day. Carry-In Service offers
repair on a contractual or noncontractual basis. Contract customers get unlimited
repairs at a fixed monthly rate. This allows them to predict and control their
service costs. Noncontract customers pay for parts and labor on a per-event
basis.</P>
<P>Digital also offers an over-the-counter exchange. If you can identify the
component causing the problem, simply bring in the module. You then exchange it for
a replacement &#8211; within minutes.</P>
<H4>DECmailer</H4>
<P>For self-maintenance customers with noncritical applications or who keep their own
spares inventory, DECmailer offers a low-cost mail-in repair service for modules and
components. Turnaround of five days is typical with DECmailer.</P>
<H3>The Digital Commitment</H3>
<P>We are committed to supporting your Digital terminals and printers. Our worldwide
Field Service organization of more than 16,000 people is standing by to ensure that
no matter what your service needs, Digital has a service program to support you.
Contact your Digital representative for the location of the Digital Servicenter
nearest you.</P>
<H2>Software Services</H2>
<P>Software Services are available to support Digital's customers during any aspect
of their system analysis, software development, or implementation efforts. Services
available start with the personal attention of a Digital software consultant and
continue with the distribution of up-to-date software and software information.</P>
<P>A software specialist often works with your Digital sales representative to
evaluate your needs prior to purchase, to recommend hardware and software solutions
to problems, and to give advice on the feasibility and costs of proposed
solutions.</P>
<P>Depending on the software purchased, specialists are available to install
software and provide software warranty support to ensure that purchased software
products perform according to Digital's commitments. Ongoing software support is
assured through a variety of post-warranty Software Product Services, which offers
customers the opportunity to keep their software up-to-date and running smoothly.
A full range of additional services are available to assist customers throughout
the planning, implementation, and production phases of their systems.</P>
<P>For those software products that require Digital installation, a software
specialist will install the software and verify that the system is complete. Software
warranty services include telephone assistance and onsite remedial support, if
necessary. Services also include automatic delivery of in-warranty Software Product
and Documentation Updates and the distribution of a periodic newsletter. Software
Performance Reports are included under warranty services as well.</P>
<H3>Software Product Services</H3>
<P>Software Product Services (SPS) provide informational, preventative, and remedial
service to help customers after the period of software warranty. These services
provide new software versions, responses to reported software problems, and
technical publications that contain programming notes and documentation updates.</P>
<P>The family of Software Product Services included four levels of service: Software
Product Updates, Self-Maintenance Service for Software, Basic Service for Software,
and DECsupport Service for Software.</P>
<H4>Software Product Updates</H4>
<P>Software Product Updates are the latest available version of software. They
contain technical changes, product improvements, and documentation refinements.</P>
<H4>Software Self-Maintenance Service</H4>
<P>Tools are provided that enable users to maintain their own system software. These
include Software Product and Documentation Updates, sent automatically as they are
released; newsletters containing information about new software developments and
enhancements; and Software Performance Reports, a formal software problem-reporting
mechanism.</P>
<H4>Basic Service</H4>
<P>This service is appropriate for users who require some, but not total, service. It
includes all the elements of Self-Maintenance Service, plus telephone support for
usage and remedial software questions.</P>
<H4>DECsupport Service</H4>
<P>This is the most comprehensive software product service available. DECsupport
includes new software versions and documentation updates, software interim updates,
newsletters, software performance reports, telephone support, remedial maintenance,
and scheduled preventative maintenance.</P>
<H4>Right-To-Copy Service</H4>
<P>This option allows customers to copy Software Product Updates onto a single,
additional CPU. It is suitable for customers who are running identical operating
system software on several similar CPUs, and who want o copy the updates only.</P>
<H3>Additional Software Services</H3>
<P>Digital's software professionals are specifically trained in Digital's products
and experienced in designing, coding, and modifying custom software as well as
tailoring VAX and PDP-11 software to meet special needs. Software specialists are
available to provide system analysis, application design review and optimization,
and system/application integration. Resources are available to perform specific
project tasks, to supplement a customer's programming staff, or to manage projects
from start to completion.</P>
<P>Specialists with varying types of expertise are available, ranging from a
programmer to a project manager, depending on customer requirements. These services
are available at both resident and per-call rates, and also on a fixed
price-per-project basis.</P>
<H3>Startup Services</H3>
<P>Startup services are a proven combination of direct assistance, documentation
review, discussion, and hands-on experience provided onsite by a Digital Software
Specialist.</P>
<P>Users learn directly on their own systems and can put their knowledge to use
immediately. These on-site services are conducted over a period of time to ensure
mastery of the system. Programmers and system managers are taken step-by-step through
the techniques required to operate a particular system effectively. Startup service
enhances the ability of users to keep their systems running smoothly by teaching
them how to troubleshoot problems.</P>
<P>Digital's Software Services group meets customer needs by offering a wide range
of options to supplement the standard Startup Services. Because optional services
are priced according to the time they require, an estimate can be given for any
requirement a customer may be considering. In addition, a Digital Software Specialist
can draw up a Customer Support Plan to help you to determine any further areas in
which you might benefit from additional services.</P>
<H3>The Digital Commitment</H3>
<P>Although software services are not available for terminals and printers per se,
they are available for the Digital systems the terminals and printers are used
with.</P>
<P>The foundation of Software Services is the more than 3,000 dedicated software
specialists. You can consult with these specialists before and after you make a
software decision. The Software Services group sees to the installation of your
software purchase, and keeps your software running long after the warranty has
expired. Digital software specialists use the most innovative support tools
available to ensure that the software you buy and use today meets your needs
tomorrow.</P>
