Problem: In a directory, perform a certain operation PROG_SUCCESS on the
newest file
matching the glob pattern X*. If no file exists with this glob pattern,
execute PROG_FAIL.

Here is my solution:

file=3D$(ls -1t X* 2>/dev/null|head -n 1)
if [[ ${#file} -gt 0 ]]
then
  PROG_SUCCESS $file
else
  PROG_FAIL
fi

This certainly works, and I think it's not that bad either. Just
wondering whether
this can be written less clumsy. Any suggestions?
