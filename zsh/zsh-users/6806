Subject: Question about extended globbing

Hi all ;),

I'm trying to create a pattern to match a given set of files that do not
match some pattern. I found that the ^ globbing operator, with the option
extended_glob set would help me to do this, but the thing is that i don't
know how to make two patterns to be affected by this operator,

I tried something like:

grep something $FOO/^{*txt,*info}

but it didn't work. How can I achieve to include several alternatives with
the ^ operator?

Thanks,
