I've just noticed in _perl that it only completes *.p[ml].  Is there a
way that I can change this using zstyle somehow?  I would like to also
complete '*.t' files too (perl tests).

I've had a look at the docs, but I'm still not entirely clear on how
things hang together, I'm afraid...

Thanks,
-Dom
