Okay, I've put "_match" out of "matcher-list".

And another one for my .zshrc ;-)

Yeah, probably. But my understanding of the whole "zstyle" stuff and
syntax is not so deep (for a proof see "This style is not doing
anything" above).

Why?

Yes, almost. Peter Stephenson's description of these options in the
User' Guide is so persuading that I thought: "Sounds good and
reasonable to me. Let's set this to 'true'.".

For instance?

Did that (although I don't know what "yuk" means). I've set most of
these options two and a half years ago when I first got in contact
with zsh and read the User's Guide.

If reading the description of the option made me think "I don't have
the slightest idea what that means", I optioned for the default. And
every time I thought "Wow, looks like some extra functionality", I set
the option.

Shame on me that I had "shwordsplit" set until a few weeks ago ;-)
