} Well, it's about the only bit of the configuration not yet done in (at
} least) two stages, so I don't see why it shouldn't share the pain.

It's not really two stages; the code still executes at the same time it
always did, it just happens to be in two files.  If you prefer, it could
be written like this:

AC_OUTPUT_COMMANDS(,[if test -z "\$CONFIG_FILES\$CONFIG_HEADERS"; then
`cat ./${CONFIG_MODULES}.sh && rm -f ./${CONFIG_MODULES}.sh`
fi])
. ./${CONFIG_MODULES}.sh

That actually copies the code from configure into config.status, so that
the .sh file doesn't have to be left behind.
