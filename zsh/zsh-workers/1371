That problem should not occur with beta21.

Do not you use ncurses?  ncurses-1.9.8a had a bug which sometimes turned
off automargin in xterms.  This has a very similar effect.  This bug is
fixed in ncurses-1.9.9e.  The symphtomes are that when you write anything
to the screen which is longer than the width of the terminal the line will
not wrap (e.g. when you use cat to display a file lines longer than the
screen width will be truncated).
