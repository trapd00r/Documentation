1) As long as the completion functions are correct, they won't see
   such messages.
2) Yes, maybe, but: how? The only thing I could think about here is to 
   make _normal check if it got called with the same words/CURRENT/etc 
   as on the last call and then do some error handling if it was.
   Looks a bit weird. Somehow. Dunno.


Bye
