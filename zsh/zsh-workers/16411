It could be useful as a utility function anyway though. That it would
be used in _su convinces me. Including the $service setting stuff would
make it slightly less small. Perhaps it could be merged with _contexts
which is similar anyway.

It looks good to me and seems to work well. Using eval instead of $=tmp
is not something I'd thought about. I suppose it might be useful to get
at one of the special variables like $words or $QIPREFIX.
