<URL:http://slashdot.org/> is reporting that ksh93 is available under
a license which looks like it's Open Source(not TM).  Download page is
<URL:http://www.research.att.com/sw/download/>.  

Not that I'm suggesting zsh isn't better---the completion that zsh is
clearly better, but having this available ought to make compatibility
easier to ensure.  And tksh looks interesting.  (Also available as
open source is AT&T's GraphViz <URL:http://www.graphviz.org>, which
has nothing at all to do with shells, but it's cool.)

The ast-open package also include tw:

tw is a combination of find and xargs that applies C style expressions
on the stat structure of each file in a directory hierarchy.

      tw

lists the directory hierarchy under the current directory,

      tw chmod go-rwx

changes the mode of all files in the directory hierarchy under the
current directory by calling chmod as few times as the exec arg limit
allows.
