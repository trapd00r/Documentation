[ZSH_VERSION is 4.0.1-pre-2]

Typing `foo<ESC-/>' (bound to _history-complete-older) finds the most recent
word in the history beginning "foo".  Typing <ESC-/> again appears to do
nothing.

Is it possible to set things up so that repeatedly typing <ESC-/> cycles back
through all matches in the history?  (ala Emacs' dabbrev-expand)

Thanks,
