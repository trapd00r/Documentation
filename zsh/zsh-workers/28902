Hello,

Sorry if this is the wrong place, but neither google nor
hand-examining the zsh sites turned up a place for such submissions...

Anyway, I wrote a vcs_info backend for the fossil scm
(http://fossil-scm.org/). I'd like to donate the code back to the zsh
community, but don't see an obvious way to do so.

You can find the source repository at:
https://mwm@chiselapp.com/user/mwm/repository/vcs_info You can either
clone that (with fossil, of course) or download a zip archive from
there (Login, use the captcha as password for anonymous, timeline, top
link in timeline, ZIP archive at the bottom of the overview) or let me
know what I should do to submit them.

Oh yes - not subscribed to the list, so please make sure replies come
back to me as well as the list.

     Thanks,
     <mike
