I'm using beta8 on Solaris 2.3, and I get this:

sunbox - ~: echo {1..10}
. 0 1

Configure defined HAVE_STRTOL.

It also seems to refuse to run .zshlogin and .zshlogout, even when I run it
as '-zsh' or 'zsh -l' (I have to hack it from my .profile, as I can't set
it as my default shell without installing it on all our systems :) Usually,
it dumps core when invoked from .profile, thus:

	echo "Let's use zsh instead"
	exec /export/home/johny/bin/-zsh
