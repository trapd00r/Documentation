May be I missed something, but ...

I compiled 3.1.5 statically without dynamic loading support. It looks, like
some modules are missing - notably, I cannot find stat command any more.

What was wrong? Is it possible to explicitly say (a la apache) which modules
should be compiled in statically? Would be a nice addition.

thank you
