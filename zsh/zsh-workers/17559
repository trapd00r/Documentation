    Hi Sven :)

[...]

    Is there a way to add a 'generic' dependency so a completion is
loaded before 'complist'?. I mean: complist needs some form of
completion to get menu selection to work, so if 'compctl' is not
loaded, which other can I load?.

    Anyway, loading by hand compctl is not an issue (for me, at least).

    Raúl
