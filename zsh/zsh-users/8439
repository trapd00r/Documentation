} whereas on Cygwin, it had the list of files in the parent dir.

Do you have any zstyles set at all?  Put another way, have you tried
reproducing this with 'zsh -f' (running autoload and compinit by hand)?

The only obvious reason that compfiles would behave that way at that
particular spot is if the "fake-files" style were set to something.
