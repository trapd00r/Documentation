Dear all,
    I have this long-standing question, which I can't find an answer to,
perhaps because it's impossible.  Is it possible to redirect
STDOUT/STDIN/STDERR/just about any file descriptor *in the middle of* a
script, not at the beginning?  That is,

#!/bin/zsh
... (part of which the STDOUT is, say, your terminal)
...
(some magical redirection command I'm looking for, which should do what
    perl's open STDOUT ">foo.out" will do)
... (and from this point on, everything you send to STDOUT will go to foo.out)
...

Am I asking too much to a mere shell?  :) 

Cheers,
Jahwan
