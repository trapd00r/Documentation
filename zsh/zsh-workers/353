If a here-document contains a line longer than 255 characters, it causes SEGV
(not on all OS, eg. on Solaris it only produces a wrong output, but it causes
SEGV on elf-linux).  I had no time to trace the bug but it may be related to
Peters input patches (in which case it is not reproducible with vanilla
beta10).
