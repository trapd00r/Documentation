Those of you experimenting with colours on terminals that allow more
than the simple set of colours might like to be reminded about
user-defined arithmetic functions.  For example, I've got the following
to set up colours for rxvt.

    autoload -U zmathfuncdef
    # colour takes red, green, blue (0..3) as arguments
    zmathfuncdef colour '16 + $1 * 16 + $2 * 4 + $3'
    zle_highlight=(
      # sort of lightish blue on dark red
      region:fg=$((colour(2,2,3))),bg=$((colour(1,0,0)))
      # yellow on dark blue
      isearch:fg=$((colour(3,3,0)))bg=$((colour(0,0,1)))
      # white on not very dark green
      default:fg=$((colour(3,3,3))),bg=$((colour(0,1,1)))
    )
