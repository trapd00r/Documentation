I, at least, am. That's why I'm not planning to give this real support.

Switching on menu-select instead of menu-complete: no. This was at
least half-intentional because menu-select takes over control
completely. You can, however, go from normal menu completion to
menu-select and back again (if you have it bound to a key).
And of course you can use menu-select as one of the styles to use for
the new completion system (after loading collist).

Doing this with an option or configuration key is currently not
possible because zle/comp1/compctl don't know about collist. And I
would like to have some more feedback before I start thinking about
ways to support this. Ok?

Bye
 Sven
