}     I've posted a minute ago a possible solution, using more or less
} the same mechanism, only I was using ':' as the separator and not
} '\0' because it doesn't work for me.

I gather from your subsequent posting that you got it to work after all.

I still recommend "print -rN" here.

}     Although I don't know why I need the double quotes if I use ":-"
} after the (ps) flag :? Is to avoid the shell splitting the entire
} string in the assignment before we can do the (ps)?

The results of $(...) and `...` are always subject to word splitting
unless quoted.  It's part of the definition of those substitutions.  
So, yes.
