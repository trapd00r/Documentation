Just to mention, that .zlogout is listed in FILES section in manual, but
never mentioned anywhere in text. In particular, I don't know, if .zlogout
is _always_ excuted when shell exits (e.g. HUP) or only when exiting with
exit/logout command. Or only logout?

BTW if zsh is started as csh, are csh-specific files (.login, .cshrc,
.logout) executed?
