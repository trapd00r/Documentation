	isn't this what wait was designed for?

foo () {
   /bin/blah >>(grep -v "foo")
   wait
}

	what exactly is the syntax that >> uses to become a pipe
rather than a redirection to a file?  the way you describe it looks
a lot like a ksh two-way pipe, only cleaner; as i mentioned in my other
reply to this thread, i've never been able to get |& to work, so
any alternative would be welcome.
