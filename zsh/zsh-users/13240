} Here's how it is done in Ruby which is extremely simple: if there is an

I think you and the zsh/mapfile manual are talking about two different
things here.

What you seem to be asking for (based on what SCRIPT_LINES__ really
does in Ruby) is to have the zsh script parser stuff the lines it reads
into a variable as it parses them, so that (for example) "autoload"
would magically copy the function text into the SCRIPT_LINES__ array.

The excerpt above means that it's not possible when loading zsh/mapfile
to cause the variable "mapfile" to have a different name.  That has
nothing to do with script parsing.
