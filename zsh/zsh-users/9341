Yes, from my extensive testing of one FreeBSD system, one Linux  
(Gentoo) system, and one OS X system, there does not seem to be a  
consistent way of getting this information.

'stat' on OS X does not seem to store the created date.  That killed  
the best chance for compatibility right there.

There are a couple of different ways to get it in OS X.

Tiger:
     mdls "${FILES}" | awk -F'"' '/kMDItemContentType /{print $2}'

gives me

     2005-08-20


If developer tools are installed:

     /Developer/Tools/GetFileInfo "${FILES}" |  awk -F' ' '/created: / 
{print $2}'

gives me

     08/20/2005

which isn't the format I wanted, so I'm sticking with 'mdls' for now.


Thanks to all who responded!
