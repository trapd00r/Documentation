  fignore=(.FASL)

or

  fignore+=(.FASL)

to preserve the current contents

  zstyle ':completion::complete:vi(m|):*' ignored-patterns '*.FASL' 

This restricts the effect to just "ordinary" completion, i.e. not all
the various clever additions like spelling correction etc.  To make it
more general,

  zstyle ':completion:*:*:vi(m|):*' ignored-patterns '*.FASL' 

should be good enough.
