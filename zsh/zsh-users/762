But the warning doesn't happen only in login shells.  Each time I
press C-d in my xterm or screen terminal, I get the warning.  Note
that the warning really is unnecessary because the nohup is set, so
zsh will do nothing about the jobs.

Yes, you can do that, but the goal of the patch was to enhance the
default behaviour for a casual user.  I know one can get all of it
through .zlogout.
