Because I have never seen this with bash, so I thought it might be a bug 
instead. Thanks for your explanation.

I see the behavior easier now :

[~]> echo -n foo
foo%
[~]>

Is there a way to omit this % ? Because if I do setopt NOPROMPT_SP it got 
worse :

[~]> echo -n foo
[~]>

Nothing is printed.
