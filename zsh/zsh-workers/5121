The following files have appeared as if by magic at:

This has been test with static linking on AIX 3.2 and with dynamic
linking on AIX 3.2, IRIX 6.2, SunOS 5.6 and HPUX 10.20.

The list of changes is appended.  Note that zle -C now does Sven-like
new completion; the old compctl-like zle -C has disappeared.
Conversion in most cases is straight forward.

I've discovered one bug with zle -C which I'm too lazy to report
separately:

% zle -lL
zle -N backward-delete-space-word
zle -N complete-directory complete-word __complete_directory
zle -N complete-filename complete-word __complete_filename
zle -N forward-delete-space-word
zle -N history-complete-word complete-word __history_complete_word
zle -N most-recent-file complete-word __most_recent_file

Four of those 6 should actually appear as zle -C.  The fix is actually
simple, now I've spotted the mistake, but it'll have to wait now.
