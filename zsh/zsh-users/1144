	i long time ago, i wrote a quick function to take a list of
space-delimited dirs, check to see if each one was currently in my path, and if 
not, add it.  i was just trying to make some changes to it, when i noticed in my 
.zshrc (modified from one that i got from someone else) a line saying 

cdpath=(. .. ~)

	i hadn't declared $CDPATH anywhere in my .z* files, but echoing $CDPATH 
after login returned
	
.:..:/home/sweth/sweth

	i'm assuming that this is some sort of zsh path-addition option, along 
the lines of what i had created; i couldn't find any reference to it in the FAQ, 
however, other than a note in the wish-list for users to "be able to create 
their own foopath/FOOPATH array/path combinations."  does anyone know anything 
more about this feature?
