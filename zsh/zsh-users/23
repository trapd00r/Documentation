Hi,

I have a very simple script. It looks like this..

#!/home/sunshine/grad/unpingco/bin/zsh
echo 'hey'

the script file is listed as...

-rwx--x--x  1 unpingco       50 Jun 25 10:05 cf.zsh*

and the binary for zsh is in

-rwx------  1 unpingco   475136 Jun 24 13:44 bin/zsh*

and the full pathname to zsh is

/home/sunshine/grad/unpingco/bin/zsh

when I try to invoke it on the command line as

zsh> cf.zsh

I get 

zsh: command not found: cf.zsh

I can't figure this.  I've shuffled the permissions every which way and it still
won't work.  Something is weird here. I'm out of ideas.

any help much appreciated.
