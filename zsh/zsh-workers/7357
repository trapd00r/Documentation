Is this a bug or a feature?

In a directory with 32 files...

alpha3-~% a=(*)
alpha3-~% echo $#a
32
alpha3-~% noglob a=(*)
zsh: command not found: a=(*)
alpha3-~% noglob set -A a *
alpha3-~% echo $#a
1

So assignment using '=' doesn't appear to be a command.  What is it
then?

This is on zsh-3.0.5.
