Subject: mb_metacharlenconv vs. tokens

Apparently mb_metacharlenconv gets passed tokenized string (how is it called
properly in zsh lingua?) It means that the fact length(any-token-char) == 1
is actually side effect of mbrtowc failing miserably and mb_metacharlenconv
returning fallback 1 (at least using UTF-8).

Should not it untokenize character first? If yes, I will provide a fix as
 part of larger patch; if no, I fail to see how it works then.
