Thanks.

It's on Sourceforge, so if you have an account there I can add you in the
appropriate places.

Then you use rsync; for example to get the entire hierarchy into the
current directory,

  rsync -aiv <user>,zsh@web.sourceforge.net:htdocs .

and appropriate variants for anything else.

I think the CVS directories are from the old sunsite.dk site and aren't
useful any more (so just make files writeable if you need to change them).
I don't know if we have the corresponding CVS archive.
