} I went with a hyphen for consistency's sake.

Actually, the "verbose" style is just a boolean now, isn't it?  It
could instead become a string style that describes various levels
of verbosity.  Instead of "extra-verbose" with a value of "yes", the
"verbose" style would have a value of "extra".

Or something like that.  Certainly "extra-verbose" is fine, too.
