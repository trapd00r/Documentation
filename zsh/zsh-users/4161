Hi.

I was using compctl before but now i decided to use compsys.
When i use a little modified zsh-4.0.2/StartupFiles/zshrc as ~/.zshrc,
my zsh won't complete backquote and etc. like below.

pote% kill -HUP `cat /var/run/in[TAB]
pote% kill -HUP `cat /var/run/inetd.pid 

With compctl, i got
pote% kill -HUP `cat /var/run/inetd.pid`
and, i expect it.

Is it just because i omit some option?

thanks.
