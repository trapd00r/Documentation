I've been trading some private mail with Gray, and this problem turns out
to be a gdb issue rather than a zsh issue.  The reason that zsh was the
only shell exhibiting the behavior had to do with "stty tostop" combined
with some confusion over "ttyctl -f".  Gdb exhibits the same behavior in
bash if "stty tostop" is in effect.

I've suggested that Gray report this to the gdb bug list.
