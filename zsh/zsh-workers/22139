} However, I was wondering if it would be nicer to switch both the old and

I prefer the \M- form because it gives you some clue what you should do
to generate the equivalent value from the keyboard.  Similarly, I think
the output should continue to resemble that of "bindkey -L".

I wouldn't be hearbroken either way, though.
