Subject: gethostbyname2() tweak

I went ahead and committed a change that I tossed in as an extra in a
previous, uncommitted patch:

Don't define gethostbyname2() as static, since it can clash with the
system header files on a system that provides the prototype but not
the object.

The change is trivial:
