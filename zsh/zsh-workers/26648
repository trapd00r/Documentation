} Unfortunately that does not play nicely with PRINTEIGHTBIT.

Well, yes and no.  One could argue that PRINTEIGHTBIT doesn't mean
"print multibyte as raw bytes" but rather "if the character set is
not multibyte then print characters even if the high bit is set."

However, I agree that --enable-multibyte should not have the effect
of changing the behavior on single-byte I/O where the high bit happens
to be set.
