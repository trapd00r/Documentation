    Sorry, I didn't mention that it has to be done in one step
(namely in the print command) and the "string" to be printed is $*.

    I think I could save "$*" in a parameter (it won't be splitted
nor any other thing except printed) and apply your solution :)
Anyway, is there a way of doing all in one step, with the
restrictions I mention above?

    It's OK to use '\0' if I apply this solution, althoug it is not
needed because ALL pad characters will be " " and ALL pad characters
will be added by the pad flags. The string won't have trailing or
leading spaces (well, it is not supossed to...) Thanks :)
