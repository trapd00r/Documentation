A possible clue is the intervening bit I missed out, which checks if
there's still an array after making it unique and if not handles a
single element.  Sorting doesn't affect this.  You can't rely on the
list being sorted, so it must handle any combination.  I doubt it makes
that much difference in practice; the typical uses for unique lists
that I can think of aren't ordered.
