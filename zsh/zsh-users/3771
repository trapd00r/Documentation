:Somewhere my zsh terminals are getting vim
:keybindings out of nowhere. My other account
:doesn't do it, and the only difference
:between the two are some variables in my
:.zshrc that don't seem like they should
:affect my keybindings.
:Is there something special that could be
:causing this (btw, it only happens on
:my xterms, not console), or is there a way
:to unset these vim bindings?

See the manual on KEYMAPS (section zshzle).
You probably want "bindkey -e" somewhere in your .zshrc
