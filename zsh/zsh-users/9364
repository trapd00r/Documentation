    Because that's not enough, I'm afraid. If the command is an
script with a bangpath and the interpreter doesn't exist, the
"[[ -x command ]]" test will succeed but the execution will fail. By
the way, in that case zsh will return 127 instead of the correct 126,
although if I recall correctly, that has been dealt with in latest
CVS :?

    Thanks for your suggestion :) I'm looking for something in that
line, but it's quite difficult. It has to be portable or at least
work in zsh and bash, that will cover nearly 90% of the boxes, and
that's a problem by itself.
