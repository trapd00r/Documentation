I've now put this on. I couldn't call the page News because that
is already taken so I called it "Release Notes". Let me know if
you have any better suggestions.

If I get around to it, I'll also add a features page with a table
comparing the various shells along the lines of what Felix was
asking for recently. Unless anyone else wants to volunteer?

Also on the subject of the web pages, can anyone convert the
favicon from a .png to a .ico without losing the transparency
(so that IE users get to see it and not just Mozilla users)? Or
can .ico only handle on-off transparency? Also, if anyone with
greater imagination or artistic talent than me wants to design
a better icon then please do so. For the benefit of anyone who
doesn't know what favicons are, they are just little images
that appear in the url bar or bookmarks list. IE finds them
by looking for favicon.ico on every web page it accesses (yuk)
while Mozilla uses a <link> tag. I've just used a blue `Z' on
the zsh web pages.
