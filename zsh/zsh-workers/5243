I've noticed previously that changes to Config/version.mk don't cause the
Src/version.h file to be updated.

Now, with PWS's bashautolist patch, rebuilding with the changed zsh.h left
the opts[] array messed up.  I had to `make clean` and then rebuild to get
zsh working again; I was in the middle of reporting that ZLE wasn't getting
initialized properly when I remembered that the option numbering had been
changed.

I don't have time to track this down this morning, and frankly I'm not very
familiar with the way the build works since dynamic modules were introduced,
so it might be better for someone else to do it anyway.
