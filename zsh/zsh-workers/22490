Hey all,

I was writing a script today and was getting a segfault (on what turned
out to be a very incorrect line), but nonetheless...  The attached script
when sourced into a running shell causes future tab completion to die.  I
have verified this against 4.2.6 and 4.3.2.  Looking at a backtrace
seems to show that it is hitting infinite recursion.

 % zsh -f
 [\u@\h \W]\$ . ./test.zsh
 Ok, try tab completion...
 [\u@\h \W]\$ <TAB>zsh: segmentation fault (core dumped)  zsh -f

Thanks,
Andrew Ruder

P.S. You don't have to tell me how wrong/stupid/etc.. the script in
question is... :)
