  I'm able to get the users-hosts completion for ssh, scp, and so on,
but how can I extend this functionality to my own programs?  I've been
through the manual and Google, but no zstyle line has worked for me.
How can I setup users-hosts completion for my specified commands?

  Thanks for any help!
