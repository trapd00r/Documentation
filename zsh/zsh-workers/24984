So the cursor appears to have backed up five spaces and covered over
part of the prompt?  Is that what you're trying to point out?

} And if I clear the screen using ^L prompt changes to ~garga
} 
} root@botelhor:~garga#

Aside from what PWS wrote, this does look like a bug.  Even if you've
inadvertently created a named directory garga=/home/garga, the ZLE
refresh code shouldn't mis-calculate the width of a prompt it has
already printed, or should reprint the prompt when the width changes.
