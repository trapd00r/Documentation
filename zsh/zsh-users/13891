>From the documentation, it sounds like SHARE_HISTORY is the option you 
want.  What happens if you remove INC_APPEND_HISTORY as well (and 
EXTENDED_HISTORY, too?)?  It sounds like you might not want those set 
explicitly.

>From man zshoptions:
"""

SHARE_HISTORY <K>

This option both imports new commands from the history file, and also 
causes your typed commands to be appended to the history file (the latter 
is like specifying INC_APPEND_HISTORY).  The history lines are also output 
with timestamps ala EXTENDED_HISTORY (which makes it easier to find the 
spot where we left off reading the file after it gets re-written).
