} It'll give you a SEGV in `isreallycom()', trying to look at
} `cn->u.name' which isn't set because for hashed commands `cn->u.cmd'
} is used.
} 
} +    if (cn->flags & HASHED)
} +	return 1;

Is that really the right fix?  I thought the whole point of isreallycom()
was to find cases where the hash table contains a mapping that doesn't
refer to a real executable.  I'm not sure it should succeed just because
the mapping was added explicitly.
