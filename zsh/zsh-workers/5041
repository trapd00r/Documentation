There's no way to do it that I can determine with a stock qmail/ezmlm(idx)
installation.  You can do it with a minor, non-intrusive change to
ezmlm-idx and several possibly non-trivial setup changes (from an admin
POV there would be 5 lists, not 3, but users would only see 3)

Also, someone else said something about headers "Mailing-List:" vs
"X-Mailing-List".  That's the standard ezmlm header to prevent cross
mailing list occurences.  "X-Mailing-List" could be added but you can't
remove "Mailing-List" without making intrusive changes, and as a lot of
other lists are running off the same machine that's probably not an
admin's first choice.
