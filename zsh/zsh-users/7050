You're right, the output from less is being redirected, not the output to
less.  Also, the tricks with pipes don't quite match what zsh is doing.
That's something more like:

perl -e 'pipe PIN, POUT;
if (fork) {
  close POUT;
  open STDIN, "<&PIN";
  close PIN;

  $_ = <STDIN>;
  exec "less";
} else {
  close PIN;
  open STDOUT, ">&POUT";
  open STDERR, ">&POUT";
  close POUT;

  $| = 1;
  print STDOUT "Sync\n";
  exec "cvs status";
}'
