From: Peter Stephenson <pws@ibmth.df.unipi.it>

Are coprocesses still working?  I got some strange results after trying
them in order to make the manual a bit clearer, but I don't use them often
enough to be sure.

coproc cat
print foo >&p
read line <&p

simply hung --- it did that without job control, too.  In ksh it read the
expected line and the coprocess terminated.  Trying to close the coprocess
input seemed to provoke some even stranger things.
