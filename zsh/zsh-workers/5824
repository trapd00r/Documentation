This will probably happen (if someone does it).  The last thing I though of
was two configure options, --completion-lib for where to install it
and --completion-install=core,base,builtins,all (with a cumulative effect)
to specify what to install.

That might be a good idea.

The zshcompwid manual is probably not finished yet, since there are a few
bits still in the pipeline.  I was intending to tidy it up when it was.
Then there may be a separate manual for the standard functions.  Any
existing non-completion-widget documentation is probably unlikely to change
much unless changed forcibly.
