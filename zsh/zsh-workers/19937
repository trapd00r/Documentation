As I recall, if you kill the right process with a SIGTERM or something,
then send SIGCONT to the remaining processes, it will proceed to the
other tests and complete the build successfully.

I find it curious that only sbuild exposes this problem, and now that
it's manifesting on multiple architectures, I have even less of an idea
of what the problem could be.

I wonder if a simple perl script which merely did the same signal handling as
sbuild and ran zsh's make check would give the same result.
