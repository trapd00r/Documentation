You can help if you have time.  People develop zsh in their free time for
fun, and it looks like most of them find more fun in coding than in
documentation.  The main documentation, the manual is kept up to date,
and you can get a very nice printed documentation from the texinfo
version.  It's more than a hundred page long with nice indexes and table
of contents.  It's worth reading, even experienced developers can learn
from it.  Unfortunately it is too long and written in the usual Unix
manpage style language which is sometimes hard to read for inexperienced
users.

> Etc/NEWS (or ChangeLog, or whatever) has the problem that it tends to be

ChangeLog is not for the users, it is a log for the developers.  Etc/NEWS
is updated for major releases, but it may lag behind the changes during
the development.  Note that 3.1 is beta, it is under development, and
noone guarantees that it'll work as you expect.  If you chose to use beta
software, you should be prepared for surprises.  The announcement on
zsh-announce did describe the changed options.

First it was not Zefram but me who changed this with the approval from
most of the people reading zsh-workers at that time.  And if a system
administrator installs a beta software for dezens or maybe thousans of
users, he should have a good reason and then he probably knows how to
handle these issues.  He can set up /etc/zshenv to set the option
preferred by the users.  The default options were changed to make the
shell more usable without playing with options.  Many users did not even
know about these options since they never read the manual.  Of course the
choice of options is a matter of taste, but there seemd to be a consensus
here on the new set.

But most people start using zsh exactly because it does things that other
shells don't.  Actually ALWAYS_LAST_PROMPT was one of the main reasons I
started using zsh.  When I saw this behavior, I saw the light :-).
