I think caching is dangerous in this case.  If the rpm command is being
used, then the data you are caching -- the list of installed packages
-- is almost certainly changing.  The list can also be generated (with
rpm -qa) quite quickly.  In both of these aspects, rpm is unlike, for
exxample, man, where caching is useful.
