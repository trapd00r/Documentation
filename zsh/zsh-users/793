It probably has been covered by someone else... but anyway. I'm
assuming the littlest possible working knowledge of Unix here...

All the others have (rightly) said you gotta make certain gcc is on
your PATH. Test this by just saying 'gcc --version' (that is, type
it... but you knew that, I guess ;-)

If it says anything to the effect that it (the currently running
shell) can't find gcc, then gcc is NOT in your path. Put a line

  PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH

in your ~/.profile. (Make sure /usr/local/bin is the directory
containing gcc... if it ain't replace it).

Okay, try again...

Oh, and first do a 'make clean' in the directory zsh's source resides
in (you may try this before doing this PATH dance... I noticed the run
of configure you've given is from cache... I am not an autoconf
expert, but it just MIGHT be the problem... especially if gcc IS on
your PATH already).

Anyway, hope I could help (and nobody beat me to it ;-)

Bye, J
