Exactly, it's completely meaningless in zsh.  It is ridiculous for the
standard to specify how the shell handles line editing, it implies far
too much about the architecture, and I would suggest it actively
encourages poor component design.  Who says a shell *has* to have a
version of vi built into it, for goodness sake?

Although in principle we could handle it I would be quite happy to make
a point of it being a dummy or printing an error message, with a
rationale in the documentation.
