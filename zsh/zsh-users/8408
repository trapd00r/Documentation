Thanks to Bart for this one.  From my .zshrc file:

### SSH filename globbing:
if [[ $ZSH_VERSION > 4.2 ]]; then
    autoload -U url-quote-magic
    zle -N self-insert url-quote-magic
    zstyle -e :urlglobber url-other-schema '[[ $words[1] == scp ]] && 
reply=("*") || reply=(http https ftp)'
fi
###

With the above magic, the * is automatically escaped as I type it.  I 
hope this is what you were looking for.
