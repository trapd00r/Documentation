I'm not quite sure what you're claiming, but if enter the following
after zsh -f it seems to be working fine here with the latest source
code and the command lines above.  I don't think you've got the style
set in those last examples, but I tried again without that and, though
obviously the behaviour is different, it didn't seem wrong.

autoload -U backward-kill-word-match
zle -N backward-kill-word-space backward-kill-word-match=20
zstyle ':zle:backward-kill-word-space' word-style space
bindkey '^ew' backward-kill-word-space

By the way, if you're using the word context feature (I bet not many
people are), you'll need the pattern

zstyle ':zle:backward-kill-word-space*' word-style space

That's my fault for not adding the colon and telling people to use ':*'
from the outset.
