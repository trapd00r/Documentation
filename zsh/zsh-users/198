The expand-word zle function should probably do this.  Unfortunately
expanding tilde substitutions is deliberately disabled since if one wants
to expand ~/$VAR she usually do not want to see her expanded home
directory but only wants to expand $VAR.  It is easy to change this
behaviour but what is the desired behaviour here?  E.g. expand everything
except ~/ or expand only ~+ and ~- etc.  Which do you prefer?

Bye,

Zoltan
