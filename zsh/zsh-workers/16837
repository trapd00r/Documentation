Write yourself a little widget. As a starting point:

  zle -N kill-with-spaces
  kill-with-spaces() {
    local words
    words="${(z)BUFFER}"
    BUFFER="${BUFFER%${words[-1]}[ 	]#}"
  }
  bindkey <key> kill-with-spaces

(There's a space and a TAB inside that [ ].)

Using the above you could check if $words[-1] is one of the closing
braces and if it is, search back in the array for the matching opening
brace. When found, you can delete the end of $BUFFER up to that
matching brace by using a pattern of the form:

  ${words[-n]}[ 	]##...[ 	]##${words[-1]}[ 	]#


Bye
