I hadn't provided a screenshot before the resize because the contents
were the same (except the space between PS1 and RPS1).

Here it doesn't. Actually the %* time isn't changed for the *first*
resize, but it is updated for the consecutive ones. Strange.

I can reproduce this problem even with zsh 4.3.10-dev-2-cvs1114
(Debian's zsh-beta package) using "zsh-beta -f" then RPS1="%*".

No, %*.

Yes, when I hit [Enter], the following two things occurred:
1. the current prompt (shown in Screenshot 1) was *replaced* by
   the one with 16:00:03;
2. a new prompt was printed (the one with 16:00:37).

I think that (1) should have been done at resize time. That would
also solve the problem mentioned above about %*.

Well, there are the same problems with GNOME Terminal. So, I think
that the bug is in zsh. Are you sure that zsh flushes its output?
