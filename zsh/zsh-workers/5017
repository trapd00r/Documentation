Until now I was only thinking about using `compctl's from completion
function (but in the same way you did). But I think we should give it
some arguments, e.g.: should `-T' be used, should `-D' be used, etc.

Hm... [time passes, thinking], no currently this doesn't look too hard 
to implement, but when dealing with the completion code you'll never
know ;-)


Bye
