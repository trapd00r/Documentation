But only if there is also a `>' and the stuff them forms a valid
number range (and, of course, you must have the right options set).

I wasn't very happy with the space-removal on redirection operators
anyway, though. But to make this right, we would need to leave a space 
if that was added and to replace a slash (if one was added) with a
space. There is no way to do this easily for now.
