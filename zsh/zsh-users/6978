Perldoc is running "less", which defaults to displaying the control
characters visibly.  It needs the -R option to allow it to display ANSI
control sequences directly to the terminal.  You can type the option
after perldoc/less is running to test that this fixes the problem for
you, and then set it in your environment in your .zshrc (and set a few
other options while you're at it) for a permanent solution:

    export LESS=mqeisz-2XR
