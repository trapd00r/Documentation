It should be just a question of #include'ing <sys/stat.h> and testing if
either st_atim.tv_nsec or st_atimensec is present in struct
stat---however, you'd need to be sure the definitions aren't trodden on
by something in system.h.  We really need to be sure of that anyway, to
ensure consistency, but actually system.h is a bit murky (and I mean a
bit murky on the zsh scale, not on the scale of good programming).
