In the brief period between installing Linux and changing the default
shell to zsh, I noticed bash's tab tab feature, where pressing tab once
will try to complete a word as per usual, but if it can't, pressing it a 
second time will give a list of commands.  It is equivalent to pressing
TAB then ^D, but I like it just that little bit better.

The FAQ gave just about every other possibility of completion config, but
I couldn't find this particular one.
Can anyone help with this?

thanks.
