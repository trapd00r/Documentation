Subject: Completion in braces limitation
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Completion in braces doesn't seem to work in combination with variables:

zsh -f
less $PWD/<tab>  - beep and lists files
less $PWD/{<tab> - just beeps

Another feature which would be useful is if completion of variables was
extended to
properly handle associative arrays. So for example, if I have an
associative array named 'test',
cd $test[<tab>
would complete from the list of keys in $test.

Thanks
