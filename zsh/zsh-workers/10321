Yes, please, that would be great.  I'll update the CVS stuff when it's in
place (I'm assuming you have the transfer of Tanaka Akira's backnumbers in
hand).

And potentially Zefram if he's got any time/inclination.

barts and wischnow are now developers in group zsh.  Let me/Adam know if I

I can't see a good reason for shifting them for now.  It would be quite
good to have incoming mail forwarded from Sourceforge, which would mean
people who don't subscribe, but are using Sourceforge, can send messages
without worrying whether they're in Denmark or California.
