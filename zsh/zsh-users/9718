Subject: Tip of the day: automounted home directories

Here's how to get completion for home directories under /home which are
handled by the automounter, assuming the automounter is using
/etc/auto.home:

homes=($(awk  '$1 !~ /^#/ { print $1 }' /etc/auto.home))
zstyle ':completion:*' fake-files "/home:$homes"
unset homes

If the automounter is using the NIS map auto.home, change the first line
to:

homes=($(ypcat -k auto.home | awk '{ print $1 }'))
