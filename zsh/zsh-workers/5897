Actually, reading manual one gets impression, that bindkey -A old new is
exactly, what was needed ... after trying

bindkey -A vicmd main (being in emacs by default)

no input was possible. The commands were O.K. (I could get up and down
history, I could even do cw - and word disappeared, as it should), but no
input (self-insert) was possible.

Probably, bindkey should somehow check this condition ...
