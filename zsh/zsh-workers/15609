} I had assumed that it was done this way for a reason such as handling
} a strange option combination or that it was considered more readable
} to have the [@] there. Maybe someone does have a reason?

In the argument list of a command, it might be done just to alert the
reader that multiple arguments are potentially being provided.

In an expression like `args=( $args[@] ... )', the extra info is minimal.
