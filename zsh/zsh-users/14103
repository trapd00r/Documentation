Yes... But I did not declare my true purpose, opting instead for a
simplified example which I thought easier to explain. What I was really
after was syncing my music collection (in this particular case,
propagating deletions) between a FLAC directory structure and an MP3
equivalent. I posted a link to the complete script in a reply. I don't
think this is doable with rsync, but I have got feeling my entire script
could be replaced with two or three clever 'find' calls.
