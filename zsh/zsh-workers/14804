From: Peter Stephenson <pws@csr.com>

This turns up a lot:

> configure:6934: cc -qlanglvl=ansi -c  -O   conftest1.c 1>&5
> configure:6935: ld -o conftest1.so  -G -bexpall -lc conftest1.o -ldl -lcurses -lm  -lc 1>&5
> ld: 0711-327 WARNING: Entry point not found: __start

If we're lucky all we have to do is find the appropriate library for
linking in which provides __start and other stuff associated with dynamic
libraries.  Probably isn't that simple, though, since -ldl doesn't seem to
do the trick.
