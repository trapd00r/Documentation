It depends a bit on the terminal... some turn "Alt ." into "Esc .", other pass
through "." with the 8th bit set.  If the latter is happening you'd need to
use "bindkey -m" to apply the appropriate definitions, which means you
can't use non-ASCII characters from the keyboard (this consequently
produces a warning nowadays).  A better option might be to investigate
whether your terminal can convert the "Alt . input" into "Esc ."

Unless you're in vi mode, in which case you can just bind it in the obvious
way.

bindkey -M viins '\e.' insert-last-word

This would mean there's a delay when you hit Esc to go to command mode,
because the shell needs to decide whether there's a "." next or not.
