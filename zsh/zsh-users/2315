Subject: compctl for rcs?

	does anyone have a good compctl lying around for the
various rcs commands?  in particular, i want one that will
complete filenames in either the current directory, or ones
inside the RCS directory in the current directory with the
,v removed. 

	also, has anyone else been getting mail to this list?
i've received about three messages in the last few weeks, and
see no others on the archives.  is everyone just really busy
with other things?  (replies to this question can be sent to
me directly so as not to clutter up the list, obviously.)
