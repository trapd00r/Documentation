Hi,

I found the following line in Posix (Shell Command Language, Pattern
Matching Notation, Patterns Matching a Single Character):

    A bracket expression starting with an unquoted circumflex
    character produces unspecified results.

That would mean that you should not use '.[^.]*' to find hidden files.
Instead it is stated to use '.[!.]*', which does not work in Zsh:

yooden@eumel % ls .[!.]*
zsh: event not found: .]

('.[\!.]*' works though.)


I sense a disturbance in the Force here. Why does Zsh not follow Posix
here? What am I missing?

A future startup with no patents of its own will be forced to pay whatever
price the giants choose to impose. That price might be high: Established
companies have an interest in excluding future competitors.
