Hm, actually I don't think this is a bug -- at least it is intended
behaviour. Although I admit that I partly did this for performance
reasons. So, should duplicates always be removed or should this be an
option (we're in trouble with `compctl', then -- no more option
letters).

You've missed some mails in which I wrote something about this. See
6117 and 6119 (and somewhere before that, but I don't have this in my
list any more, it seems).
