This was very helpful to me as I did not consider color to
be a cursor motion but i know that ansi escapes include
those.
I do remember seeing the effect of bad cursor movement in bash 1
when programming my PS1-prompt :) and when i ever forget to use
%{ %} at zsh PS1 once more. :)

The lack of white space is something i really suffer in
specific zsh features often and the abundance of
tooooooooooo long lines.
That makes reading so exhausting and I know it's not only me!

Functions to having done many of these nice builtin features like splitting, joining, uppercasing e.g.
would have had a much better effect on readability.  Instead
it's done using modifiers. Variables nestings have to be
blamed for much of the rest.

What would I lose if I was not to go the dirty nesting way
but assign to the same variable once again?
When would I really suffer from efficiency lack? Ever?
My only other help are continuation lines.
