} Why _diff_options tests diff and not real command ($word[1])?

It's in case the real command is an alias or function that has unknown
side-effects.

} allow me to complete GNU diff at all

You want

    compdef _diff gdiff
    zstyle ':completion:*:*:gdiff:*:version' command gdiff -v

There's still a bug in that the next time you use plain `diff' the saved
value of _diff_is_gnu will cause GNU diff options to be completed.  The
value of "_is_gnu" should probably be saved on a per-command basis.
