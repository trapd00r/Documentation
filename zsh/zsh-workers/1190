Oops.  Yes, core dumps nicely here.

Let me reword my question.  Since this doesn't work with releases
prior to beta16 either ("no command"):  Is it supposed to work?

PS.  On a totally unrelated note:  After `bindkey <any-key> prefix',
beta19 signals SEGV, when the new prefix is entered the first time.
