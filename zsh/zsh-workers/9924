I'm concerned that we should at least have a way to produce a warning
about it.  I mean, if I were to invent a function named `_files' that
had nothing to do with completion, and put it in a directory early in
my $fpath -- even PWS's guide recommends putting your own functions
before distributed ones -- three-quarters of the completion system
would be mysteriously broken for me.  If the whole completion system
has been hidden inside one giant file, how do I find out what has gone
wrong?

And lest you think this is farfetched, please note that I've had the
following in my .zshenv for many years now[*]:

    alias calc="noglob _calc"
    _calc() { awk "BEGIN {print $*}" < /dev/null }

So existing user functions with leading underscores are not out of the
question.  

Oh, and what's the handling with respect to kshautoload vs. a function
like _cvs that wants to define other functions and then call itself?
