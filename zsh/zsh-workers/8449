Oh, I thought you said it was.  You meant the value of $functions, then?
That's not so bad, but you could still get unexpected effects.

} Right. Hadn't thought about that either. But in a fully static shell,
} wouldn't it a bit surprising when, for example, parameters just appear 
} because they are used (because they were `autoloaded')?

That's what I meant about "require some changes to the way zmodload and
static modules work."  Basically, I want the modules linked in, but not
initialized until an actual "zmodload" is attempted on them.  This is
not the same as the current auto-autoloading.
