Subject: typeset verbosity
Date: Wed, 12 Jun 2002 14:42:33 +0100
Message-ID: <6924.1023889353@csr.com>
From: Peter Stephenson <pws@csr.com>

Instead of thinking about hard problems for once, I'd like to get rid of
this annoyance from `typeset' or friends on an existing parameter:

% fn() { local foo; local foo; }
% fn
foo=''
% 

How?

(1) Make the display behaviour optional.  If so, decide when to unset
    the option by default, e.g any sh-style emulation.
(2) Make the display behaviour not work inside functions.  (Making it
    not work on local parameters isn't good enough because of the -g
    flag.)
(3) Make it only work with typeset, or at least not work with local.
(4) Some combination of (1) with the others.

Only (1) can ensure POSIX compatibility.  We could add a flag to display
listed parameters instead.
