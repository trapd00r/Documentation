Didn't know about the WINDOW variable, thanks.

Another issue is if you have two X11-Forwarding sessions with two  
shells that both attach to the same screen using screen -x, which is  
my daily use case. You would have to manage two different DISPLAY  
variables.

I do not have a solution for this yet. It's a pity that screen has so  
many features but not this.

But now the discussion is not really about zsh anymore.
