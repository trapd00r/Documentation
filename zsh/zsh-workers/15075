Ah, but (and I'm sure Peter would agree with me here) it's not "zee shell",
it's "zed shell".

(But this is an old argument...  Jim Mattson and I never did agree
a pronunciation when he was on this side of the atlantic (circa '93).
I wonder what he's doing these days...)

How sad are these people?!?

Bye for now,



Duncan.
