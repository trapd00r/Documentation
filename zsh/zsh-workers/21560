Hi.

There should be a way in shells to say what happens if I try to run 
an executable file that has a filename extension belonging to some 
set.  For example, a builtin variable like this:

EXEC_SPECIAL=(/usr/local/bin/cg .c .java .cp)

What this would mean is that if foo.c is executable and someone tries 
to execute it, do this:
   /usr/local/bin/cg foo.c
Similarly for foo.java and foo.cp, or more if there are more 
extensions in the array.

See http://Yost.com/computers/compileAndGo

The above note about shells is at the end of the page.

Comments?

Dave
