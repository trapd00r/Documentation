It works for me.  However, if you do

% maps=/tmp/maps
% mpt1=~maps/mpt1
% mpt2=~mpt1/mpt2
% mpt3=~mpt2/mpt3
% cd /tmp/maps/mpt1/mpt2/mpt3

then %~ will give ~mpt2/mpt3.  If you do

% maps=/tmp/maps
% mpt1=~maps/mpt1
% mpt2=~maps/mpt1/mpt2
% mpt3=~maps/mpt1/mpt2/mpt3
% cd /tmp/maps/mpt1/mpt2/mpt3

then %~ will give ~maps/mpt1/mpt2/mpt3.  Remember that a parameter is
only used for %~ if it has already been used in a ~ expansion.  Could
this be the problem?  If so, the AUTO_NAME_DIRS option may solve it.

Seems reasonable.  It wouldn't fit in with the correction mechanism
very well, but it's possible with a bit of rearrangement.
