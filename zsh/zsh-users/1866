The manpage reads:

       . file [ arg ... ]
              Read commands from file and  execute  them  in  the
              current  shell  environment.  If file does not con-
              tain a slash, or if PATH_DIRS  is  set,  the  shell
              looks  in the components of path to find the direc-
              tory containing file.  Files in the current  direc-
              tory  are  not read unless "." appears somewhere in
              path.

So if you want to run a script in your current directory, run it like

. ./.zshrc.private
