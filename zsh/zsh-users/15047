Thanks, I've committed that.  Unfortunately I've also realised it's only
half done:  the problem occurs when doing accept-exact-dirs and the first
examined directory doesn't exist, then we are wrongly quoting donepath for
use the next time round the loop.  The good news is that (if I do this
properly) this shouldn't affect your case, with path-completion false,
because that's handled completely the first time through.  For later.
