Is there any way to "cancel" completion, when meny completion is active? The
possible meaning of "cancel" can be

 - remove anything that was inserted by completion code and restore the
original string
 - remove the part of word being completed (possibly ignoring IPREFIX)

To illustrate the latter: suppose you complete

  dd if=/a/b/c

and after menu completion has started, you found, it was somewhat wrong :-)
So, I'd like to remove anything that was inserted but leave ``dd if='' in
place.

Just musing ...
