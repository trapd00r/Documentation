Hi Marco:

In 10.4 you can avoid the cache altogether, as mdfind is sufficiently fast
to allow real-time completions for open -a.  I did however notice that the
very first time there is about a 10 second lag, which raises my blood
pressure, so I found running the mdfind command in the background upon
shell initialization speeds things up.

I implemented this hack in what is doubltess substandard code, but if you
want to play with it, _open, an augmented open function, and a few others
are here for the taking:

HTH,

Bill Scott
