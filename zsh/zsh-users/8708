Hi,

my zsh 4.2.5 on gentoo has a problem with the number of file descriptors.
They can not raise the hard limit even with the -S set as mentioned in [1]:

$ ulimit -n
1024
$ ulimit -SHn 2048
ulimit: can't raise hard limits
$ ulimit -Sn 2048 
ulimit: value exceeds hard limit

But I need a value for file descriptors > 5000 for some java application.
With ksh and zsh @ root it works as expected:
ulimit -n 1024
# ulimit -n     
1024
# ulimit -n 8192
# ulimit -n     
8192

How can I change the hard limit for the file descriptors?

I tried to find something in the archive, but the site [2] is not accessable
and the archive at [3] had no matching articles.

Thanks.

Cheers.

Heinrich
