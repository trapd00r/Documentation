} Exists since 2.4.

Oh, good grief.  I probably even knew that, once.

} Btw. You seem to prefer the syntax with *(u(user)).

I don't prefer it, I was just scribbling an example.

} In 3.1.5 this is not taken as a list of qualifiers

Parens don't work in 3.0.5 either, ever since the (x|y) grouping syntax
got introduced.  (Now that I've actually read more than the first line
of the info entry for the `uID' glob qualifier, I see that it still
mentions parens even though they won't work.)
