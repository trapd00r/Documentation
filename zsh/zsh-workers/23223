Yes, it's a bug.

This is a bit horrible.  Zsh goes into a special mode when the terminal
height is less than 3, equivalent to single line mode---that's because it
can't fit the two extra lines the line editor normally expects to be there
as a minimum under the prompt.  However, it looks like single line mode has
been allowed to lag behind the normal input mode and hasn't been fixed
for ages.  I don't have time to rewrite it completely, so I'm not sure what
to do.
