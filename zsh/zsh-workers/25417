It's required by SUSv3 for non-priviledged users for systems
supporting the User Portability Utilities option (so include the
sh of Unix conformant systems, but not necessarily POSIX
conformant ones I suppose).

Yes, sorry, I forgot the most important part of my sentence,
"without forking a subshell", or as you put it: "within
the current shell" but I suppose it's not easy to determine what
the current shell is when PS4 is expanded (especially in
pipe-lines).

The idea behind it being another way to have a DEBUG trap.
