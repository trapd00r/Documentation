That's good because libcurses.so doesn't seem to exist on 2.6 :)  It does
exist on 2.7 and 2.8.  It would appear there's a problem in the configure
script probing in 4.0.6 that wasn't an issue in 4.0.2.

Yes, we have that package already installed on our 2.8 boxes as it's
included with Solaris but it's only zsh 3.x.

Just found 4.0.4 on http://www.sunfreeware.com and it requires ncurses for
Solaris 2.6.  I'll try this for our three 2.6 boxes and then rebuild our
NFS version under 2.7.
