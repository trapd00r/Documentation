That's extremely plausible --- `on' occurs very frequently in $options.

But that implies the zsh/parameter module is loaded.  It shouldn't be
doing this by default in sh emulation.  You might want to check what
startup scripts are being executed for sh mode (running with the option
-x should show this).

I'm not sure if there's a general way round this.  We would look to move
towards separate namespaces, but that needs someone to do the work.
It's a shame we didn't initially use names like zsh_options instead.
