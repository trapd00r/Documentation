Just a casual question - why FAQ is kept under ZSH module in CVS? I ask
because if we sometimes decide to branch (e.g. stable version 4 and HEAD
for ongoing development) - FAQ presents obvious problem. It does not
actually belong to any particular ZSH revision at all.

Most projects I am aware of keep FAQ as separate CVS nodule (if CVS is
used for it at all).
