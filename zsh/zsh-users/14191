MSYS is like the Cygwin environment

zsh$ls -l $(which -a less)
-rwxr-xr-x 1 Romer Administrators 157931 Aug 25  2008 /bin/less
-rwxr-xr-x 1 Romer Administrators 169472 May 27 17:34

If my first command on the shell is:
zsh$ls -l |less
it takes the last version of less, namely:
zsh$which less
/c/Programmi/GnuWin32/bin/less

But if my first command is:
zsh$which less
/usr/local/bin/less
and then
zsh$ls -l |less
it takes the correct version.
That's strange!

Many thanks in advance,
Cesar
