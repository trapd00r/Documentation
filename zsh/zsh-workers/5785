} may be fixed in pws-12 but nothing in pws's list seemed to indicate so.

} Couple of core dumps with completion. pws-11 with all completion stuff
} installed.
} Doing ``~/src/she<TAB>'' (AUTO_CD obviously) at the prompt

I can't duplicate this in the pws-12 that I just built, at least with
only
	Src/zsh -f
	fpath=($PWD/Completion/*(/))
	source Completion/Core/compinit
	setopt autocd

You haven't said how many possible completions of ~/src/she* there are,
or whether there are any symlinks involved, so I can't be sure I'm
trying the right things ...

However, I can get this minor odd behavior:

    zsh% ~/zc<TAB>
    zsh% ~//zc

There is no possible match for "zc", though there are three directories
with names starting with "z".  The slash gets doubled only when there's
no possible match.
