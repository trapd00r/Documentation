Dear all,

I have questions again. I have succeed to setup a restricted zsh shell by
zsh 3.1.1, however, it is too restrict, it disallows users to change to
other directories. I just want to restrict users' execuable commands, but
not their directories.

Please if any know how to do, please help me.

Thanks a lot and thank you very much.

Regards,
Simon
