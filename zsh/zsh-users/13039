The short, but unsatisfactory, answer is that it's not required to
work.  diff expects to have a seekable file, for which a pipe doesn't
necessarily qualify: it depends partly on the OS and also partly on how
far back you need to seek, so you sometimes get away with it.

This is why zsh has both <(...) and =(...) process subtitution forms:
the second is a bit less efficient because it's guaranteed to expand to
a real file.

There's some Cygwin-specific code in main.c to force read-only files
into text mode.  This is a fairly murky area and I have no idea how that
affects pipes.
