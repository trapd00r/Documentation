You need to use the _describe function; see the zshcompsys manual.
There are examples of this buried in various places.  You probably won't
be able to do it inline; you need to create an array with elements
containing both completions and descriptions separated by a colon.

Here's a noddy example.

_foo() {
  local -a d
  d=(foo:"The word foo" bar:"A rod")
  _describe "noddy example" d
}
compdef _foo foo
