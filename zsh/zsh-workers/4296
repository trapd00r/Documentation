Are you getting something like this? 

( cd .. && /bin/sh Src/mkmodindex.sh Src ) \
    > modules.index.tmp
`modules.index' is up to date.
cd .. && /bin/sh $top_srcdir/Src/mkmakemod.sh Src Makemod
creating Src/Makemod.in
creating Src/Makemod
make[1]: Entering directory `/a/sgi-f/home_sgi/pws/src/zsh-3.1.4/Src'
creating Src/Builtins/Makefile.in
creating Src/Builtins/Makefile
/bin/sh: Src/Builtins:  not found

I haven't found a fix, but it seems to be related to passing $(MAKEDEFS)
down from the top level Makefile, so a workaround is to replace
'-f Makemod $(MAKEDEFS)' wherever you see it with '-f Makemod'.  This
will work as long as you don't set any of the flags in MAKEDEFS on the
command line.
