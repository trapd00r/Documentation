One regression test fails on a linux 2.6 host;

Test ./C02cond.ztst failed: bad status 1, expected 0 from:
  sleep 1
  cat unmodified
  touch newnewnew
  if [[ $OSTYPE =3D=3D "cygwin" ]]; then
    print -u$ZTST_fd "Warning: not testing [[ -N file ]] (not supported on=
=20
Cygwin)"
    true
  elif [[ "$(find . -prune -fstype nfs 2>/dev/null)" =3D=3D "." ]]; then
    print -u$ZTST_fd "Warning: not testing [[ -N file ]] (not supported wit=
h=20
NFS)"
    true
  else
    [[ -N newnewnew && ! -N unmodified ]]
  fi
Was testing: -N cond
=2E/C02cond.ztst: test failed.
The following may (or may not) help identifying the cause:
  This test can fail on NFS-mounted filesystems as the access and
  modification times are not updated separately.  The test will fail
  on HFS+ (Apple Mac OS X default) filesystems because access times
  are not recorded. This does not indicate a problem in the shell.

=46ile system was local ext3.

Never learn by your mistakes, if you do you may never dare to try again.
