Subject: How to make tab add quotes on expansion?

Hello zsh users and developers,

I am a developer of the GoboLinux distribution (http://www.gobolinux.org) 
which is, AFAIK, the only Linux distro where zsh is the default shell. I 
prepared a custom default zshrc, suited for the distro's needs (featuring 
case insensitive matching, because of our verbose names, such as 
/Programs/XFree86/Settings and other niceties) and all users seem to love 
it... zsh gets lots of praise in the GoboLinux mailing list!

There is one thing, however, that I could not find out how to configure:
I'd like to have tab-completion to add double quotes to words when the 
completed word has spaces in it (instead of having it add a backslash on each 
space). So that it would do this:

hisham@aria ~] mpg123 01<TAB>
hisham@aria ~] mpg123 "01 - Tom Sawyer.mp3"

instead of 

hisham@aria ~] mpg123 01<TAB>
hisham@aria ~] mpg123 01\ -\ Tom\ Sawyer.mp3

I know there's probably something simple I am missing, but I read the man 
pages, the FAQs and mailing list archives and haven't found out yet.

Thanks in advance,
