My "make all" ended with:

gcc -c -I.  -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -DMODULE -Wall -Wno-implicit -Wmissing-prototypes -O2 -fpic -o cap..o cap.c
rm -f cap.so
ld  -s -shared -o cap.so   cap..o   -ltermcap -lc
ld:
Warning: Unresolved:
bin_notavail
addbuiltins
deletebuiltins
gcc -c -I.  -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -DMODULE -Wall -Wno-implicit -Wmissing-prototypes -O2 -fpic -o clone..o clone.c
clone.c: In function `bin_clone':
clone.c:64: too few arguments to function `ioctl'
*** Exit 1
Stop.

"uname -a" gives:

OSF1 gonzo V3.0 347 alpha alpha

I had fixed the ypclnt.h file as advertised
in Etc/MACHINES.

I don't know enough to fix anything or
explain anything, but if information
I can provide would help someone more
knowledgeable make things work, I'd be
happy to follow instructions. 

Regards,
