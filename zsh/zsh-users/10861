You got my hopes up with this, but unfortunately I can't get this
to work, using my favorite security hole:

luser-%  sudo zsh
root-#   (various nefarious evildoing)
root-#   exit
zsh: can't write history file /Users/luser/.zsh_history

(I call it .zsh_history, BTW).

Even "sudo zsh -l" doesn't help.  $HISTFILE never changes.
I thought about having it update dynamically like $PWD,
but it seems like a lot of overhead for an occasional
irritation.  In addition, in my case at least the
ownership of ~/.zsh_history remains with luser.
