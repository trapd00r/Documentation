I had a go at this last one before, but there's not enough information,
so I had to guess.  Some module initialisation function is initialising
a hash table; the obvious one is zsh/parameter, but there was no obvious
sign of a leak there.

A test wehre every module is loaded sparately by hand with `zmodload
zsh/...' should be able to pick up which it is.
