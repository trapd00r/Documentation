Note that this patch has a problem if the original history did not have
HISTFILE set -- any new value set in the pushed history is not removed
on pop.  I've got a fix for that, but it's a pretty minor glitch, so I
won't repost the whole thing.  If you want to see my latest patch, you
can grab it here:
