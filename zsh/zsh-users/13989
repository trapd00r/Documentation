=================

within the script, run the commands "zmodload", "setopt" and "autoload -U 
zargs", and see if you get output that makes sense in a zsh environment. 
if not, the commands within your script are not being executed by zsh.

also, on your command line, check the path to zsh:
 	ls -lh =zsh

it might be in /usr/local/bin/zsh, which might cause the script to default 
to a bourne shell, and the zsh glob tricks will fail.

if the commands are preceded by sudo, try:
 	sudo zsh -c ls -l save/*(.)

or, try setting "SHELL=zsh" towards the top of the script, before invoking 
sudo.
