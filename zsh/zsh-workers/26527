I think both got it from csh, which is why nobody thought about POSIX
compatibility---apart from the fact that the combination of (i) putting
a new command on the same line as backgrounded expression (ii) not
putting a space after the "&" (iii) starting the following command with
a redirection, while perfectly valid traditional sh syntax, is a very
strange way to write.
