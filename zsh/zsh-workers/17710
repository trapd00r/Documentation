    I've tested and even invoking an interactive '/bin/sh'
(hardlinked to /bin/zsh) doesn't define $options... It's very strange
that David' Zsh does this :?

    Well, a namespace like that can be added progresively,
substituting over time the actual one without breaking current
configuration (I hope).
