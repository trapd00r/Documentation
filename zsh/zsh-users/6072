Actually I am not sure why I assumed source supports local parameters =
in any
form. Probably I was distracted by the fact that $* _is_ made local.

Hmm ... making typeset create local parameters in sourced script by =
default
will definitely break a lot of existing scripts. Probably extra =
argument to
typeset or (better) extra options to treat typesets in script as local. =
Hmm
the same options could make function definitions local as well ...
