See PROMPT EXPANSION in the zshmisc manual page.  The simplest answer is

PS1='[%n%m %~]%# '

but note (i) as I've written it you get a "%" rather than a "$", which
is the zsh convention (ii) this will show the entire directory path with
~ substitution and you might want e.g. only the last few segments.  The
manual will help you tailor it further.
