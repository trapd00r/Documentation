} I just noticed that preexec gets passed the wrong command when the

} string?

I think the empty string is the right thing; the docs say "If the history
mechanism is active, ..." and using a leading space etc. is explicitly a
way to deactivate history for this command.

I'd actually vote for:

	$1	the history line, or empty
	$2	getjobtext(), or empty (is it ever?)
	$3	getpermtext() (what your patch passes as $2)
