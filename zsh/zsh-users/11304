Hey all,
I was reading the book From Bash to Z Shell and it mentioned that
macros are possible with Bash but not zsh, so I did a search on Google
and found a patch for readline style macros that had been submitted
just shy of TEN YEARS ago.  Is there any possibility that such a
feature still may be added?  Or will it have to be either a hack or
too much reworking to happen?

Thanks either way!
