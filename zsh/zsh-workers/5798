Of course. What I meant was: the length of the word from the line.

That's what the hunks in `_path_files' did.

A positive number would allow more erros than there are characters in
the word. Dunno if there are people who would like that, though.

Implementing this would actually be quite difficult because of the
splitting `_path_files' has to do in some places.

Maybe we just let people play with it some more and then collect
suggestions how all this can be improved. What I'd like to hear about
is `unexpected' behavior (whatever that means ;-).
