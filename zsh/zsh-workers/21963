    Hi all :)

    Let's assume this script (called "testscript"):

    #!/bin/zsh
    # This is line 2

    alias testalias='\
        print This is an alias that spans;\
        print multiple lines;\
    '

    testalias

    # Next line is 12
    print $LINENO
    return 0
    # This is the last line

    $ ./testscript
    15

    It prints 15 instead of (the correct) 12, due to the alias
expansion, but this is annoying when the script has an error and zsh
prints the offending line number, because when you edit the script
the error is a few lines above.

    Is this a bug or a feature?
