This sounds like a good idea.  However, I don't think it will work for
rlogin, because some versions of rlogin require you to give the remote
host name BEFORE the options, e.g. `rlogin wilma -l fred'.

} Note to -workers - should _ssh be completing for ssh1 and ssh2 too?

Probably wouldn't hurt, although the options for ssh1/ssh2/openSSH are
a bit different.  (It looks as if _ssh is set up for openssh options,
except that ssh-keygen completion doesn't know about -d for DSA keys.)
