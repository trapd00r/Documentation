My script starts with 
  #!/bin/zsh

but then commands are preceded by  'sudo' 

Same result if commands in script are not preceded  by 'sudo', but the
script itself is launched by 'sudo' . 

anyway, no errors when the command is entered through the interactive shell
  sudo ls -l save/*(.) 

Any ideas?
