 Yeah, I forgot. But does that mean zsh is actually processing the ascii value of the key pressed? So zsh has no means to know whether it was <tab> or <c-i>?

 I have xmodmap, but that will play havoc with my entire system, and I will have reconfigure screen, vim, elinks and I don't know what else. But I guess that's the only way out. I will have to make the terminal driver send a different keystroke for <c-j> and <c-i>, the two keys I want changed from their ascii meaning.

 Thanks
