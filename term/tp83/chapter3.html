<H1 CLASS="chapterhead">VT200 Family of Video Terminals</H1>
<H2>Overview</H2>
<P>Digital's newest family of video terminals, the VT220, the VT240, and the VT241,
advance the standard set by Digital's VT100 family of terminals. The VT200 family
includes all the universal features of the VT100 family (see <A HREF="chapter5.html">Chapter 5</A>) and expands
these further by letting you control more of the terminal's operations. So that you
can tailor the VT200 family to your application. Digital has developed a series of
user-friendly set-up menus. These menus contain parameters that you can select
and change easily. Just enter Set-Up mode, move the cursor to the field of the characteristic
you want to change, and press the ENTER key. It's that simple.</P>
<P>VT220 and VT240 series terminals can be used with any of Digital's processors.
These video terminals can also work with other vendors' systems. And just like the
VT100 family, the VT200 family is fully compatible with Digital's printers.</P>

<H3>VT220 Video Terminal</H3>
<P>The VT220 video display terminal is the low-end member of Digital's new
VT200 family of video terminals. This monochromatic text terminal not only
includes all the capabilities of Digital's VT100 family, but gives you more control of
the terminal's operations.</P>
<P>Since the VT220 video terminal provides so much functionality, the unit is
totally self-contained. If you connect your VT220 terminal to a printer, such as
Digital's LA50 Personal Printer, you can print the text you've created.</P>
<P>The VT220 terminal consists of a monitor and keyboard. The monitor contains
a monochrome cathode ray tube and a terminal controller circuit board. Also contained
in the monitor are: power supply and monitor board, host serial communications
port, and printer port.</P>
<TABLE WIDTH="100%">
<CAPTION>The VT240, a monochromatic text and graphics video terminal, can be upgraded
to include an integral modem.</CAPTION>

</TABLE>
<H3>VT240 Series Text and Graphics Terminals</H3>
<P>The VT240 is a monochromatic text and graphics video display terminal. As the
midrange member of the new VT200 family, it incorporates all the features of the
VT100 family and the VT220 terminal. You can upgrade the VT240 to include the
optional integral modem that supports auto dialing/auto answering functions.</P>
<P>By generating full bit-mapped graphics in Tektronix 4010/4014 emulation, the
VT240 supports the industry's graphics standards. The VT240 also supports ReGIS
(Remote Graphics Instruction Set), Digital's general purpose graphics command
language. It allows you to create pictorial data as easily as you can create ASCII text.
By connecting this terminal to a graphics printer, such as Digital's Letterprinter
100, you can reproduce the screen's content.</P>
<P>The VT240 uses the same keyboard that is used with the VT220 terminal, a
monitor, and a system box. The system box contains the power supply, controller
board, and electrical connectors.</P>
<P>The VT241 terminal, the high-end member of the VT200 family, is a VT240
with a color monitor, instead of the monochrome one. It offers the same capabilities
as the VT240, but with the RGB monitor providing color graphics display. Because
the only difference between the VT240 and the VT241 is the monitor, this handbook
refers to them as the VT240 series.</P>
<H2>Major Features</H2>
<P>Each member of the VT200 video terminal family includes all the features listed
below:</P>
<H3>User-Oriented Features</H3>
<DL>
<DT>Universal VT100 features</DT>
<DD>Has the capabilities of the VT100 family and helps
you make a smooth transition from VT100 terminals to VT200 terminals. See <A HREF="chapter5.html">Chapter 5</A>.</DD>
<DT>Plain language set-up in three languages</DT>
<DD>Makes it easy for first-time as well
as experienced users to operate the terminal and control set-up features. Several
menus, which can be displayed in English, French, or German, present a group
of choices. From these choices, select the operating characteristic you want to
suit your particular application.</DD>
<DT>15 user-programmable function keys</DT>
<DD>When defined by the host, these keys
store a total of 256 bytes to save frequently used commands and character
sequences. This feature reduces keystrokes and helps you to improve productivity.</DD>
<DT>Downline loadable characters</DT>
<DD>Lets you design and use special character sets,
such as Katakana or Scientific, in the terminal to support your individual application.
The 94 characters are loaded from the host when needed.</DD>
<DT>Advanced video features</DT>
<DD>Characters can be assigned bold, blink, reverse
video, and underline highlighting on a character-by-character basis. This aids in
formatting, prompting, and highlighting portions of text.</DD>
<DT>24 lines by 80 or 132 columns</DT>
<DD>Allows viewing total format for detailed or
spreadsheet work so you can preview reports prior to printing. You get the same
results on paper as you see on the CRT screen.</DD>
<DT>Serial printer port</DT>
<DD>Enables you to connect a printing terminal to generate
local hardcopy printout of the VT200 screen. These two devices can share the
same communications line for added savings. The printer port will also support
other auxiliary devices.</DD>
<DT>Compose feature</DT>
<DD>The COMPOSE CHARACTER key creates characters that
do not exist as standard keys on your keyboard. This feature helps you to access
any character in the multinational character set, even if it is not displayed on
your keyboard. See your <CITE>Owners Manual</CITE> for more details.</DD>
<DT>Selective erase</DT>
<DD>Supports applications where data is entered by filling in the
blanks of a form. This allows the host, with one command, to erase selected
areas on the screen. This leaves the form intact for the next data-entry sequence.</DD>
<DT>CRT saver</DT>
<DD>Blanks the screen after 30 minutes of inactivity, prolonging the
life of the screen's phosphor. The screen display is restored by pressing any key
or if the terminal receives a character from the host.</DD>
</DL>
<H3>Compatibility Features</H3>
<DL>
<DT>EIA and 20&nbsp;mA interfaces</DT>
<DD>Both are standard on the VT200 family. With the
EIA interface, the VT200 family of video terminals meet industry standards and
achieve compatibility with most systems. The 20&nbsp;mA interface supports long distance
operation of the terminal &#8211; up to 500 feet away from the host.</DD>
<DT>Selectable local echo</DT>
<DD>This feature lets your terminal display on the screen
characters transmitted to the host. This means you can use your terminal on
non-Digital systems where local echo is not supported by the host.</DD>
<DT>VT52 and VT100 family compatibility modes</DT>
<DD>VT200 terminals are compatible
with present Digital software, as well as application software developed for
the VT52 and VT100 terminals.</DD>
</DL>
<H3>Multinational Features</H3>
<DL>
<DT>Multiple language keyboards</DT>
<DD>Keyboard versions are available for many different
languages, for example, English, French, German, Spanish, and Italian, as
well as others. The language you want to use is selected in Set-Up.</DD>
<DT>Seven-bit and eight-bit character support</DT>
<DD>For compatibility with Digital and
non-Digital systems, as well as support of multinational character sets.</DD>
</DL>
<H3>Ergonomic Packaging</H3>
<DL>
<DT>Detachable, low profile keyboard</DT>
<DD>The keyboard and the monitor can be
positioned separately for your comfort. Since the keyboard has a layout that is
similar to that of an office typewriter, the transition from office typewriter to terminal
is simple. The keyboard exceed European DIN standards for comfort and
ease-of-use.</DD>
<DT>Nonglare screen conforming to industry standards</DT>
<DD>Enhances the readability
of the screen by reducing glare. The screen is available with green, white, or

<H2>Screen Attributes</H2>
<P>Digital's VT200 family of terminals allows a standard screen display of 24 lines by
80 or 132 characters. For the VT220, individual characters are based on a seven-by-nine
dot-matrix, while for the VT240 Series it is based on an eight-by-nine dot-matrix.
These provide clear, crisp text displays.</P>
<H2>Operating Modes</H2>
<P>The VT200 family has the following operating modes, each selectable via Set-Up
from the keyboard or via escape sequences from the host.</P>
<UL>
<LI>VT200, 7-bit Control Mode executes standard U.S. ANSI functions. This is the
default mode of operation.</LI>
<LI>VT200, 8-bit Control Mode executes standard ANSI functions. It is used in 8-bit
communications environments.</LI>
<LI>VT100 Mode is an ANSI mode that emulates a VT100 terminal. It is used for
strict compatibility with Digital's VT100 family of terminals. The Digital multinational
character set is not supported in this mode.</LI>
<LI>VT52 Mode executes Digital private, not ANSI, functions. Use this mode in conjunction
with applications designed for Digital's VT52 terminal.</LI>
<LI>4010/4014 Mode is a graphics mode used with the VT240 series to display software
applications programs designed for Tektronix 4010/4014 terminals.</LI>
<LI>ReGIS Graphics Mode is available only for VT240 series operation. It can be
entered directly from the VT100 or VT200 modes using commands from the keyboard
or host. The VT240 series terminal uses ReGIS graphics mode with software
application programs designed for Digital's VT125 terminals.</LI>
</UL>
<P>These operating modes are described in detail in the <CITE>VT220</CITE> and <CITE>VT240 Programmer's
