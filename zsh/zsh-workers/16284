Subject: Addition to zsh FAQ: Zsh 4.0.4 with emacs 21.1 on Windows NT/XP
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii; format=flowed

In section 3.10 ("why does zsh not work in an emacs shell any more?"), 
you could add this, which recently bit me:

In Windows, zsh is built with cygwin and emacs is a native Win32 app, so 
they disagree about line-ending conventions.  If you try to use zsh 
under emacs, you need to do this in your .emacs:
  (setenv "CYGWIN" "nobinmode")
If you don't do this, zsh will see spurious ^M (CR) chars at the end of 
every line you type and will give you errors.
