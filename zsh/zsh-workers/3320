zsh people,

    FYI:  zsh 3.0.4 compiles cleanly and runs on both of the
following platforms:

    SCO OpenServer 5.0.4
    SCO Unixware 2.1

Since these weren't mentioned in Etc/MACHINES, I thought I'd
drop a note to the list.  (I'm hoping this is the right place
to send this information.  The FAQ wasn't too specific.)

-Steve
