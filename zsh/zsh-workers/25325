X-Virus-Status: Clean

Confirmed with a fairly recent CVS-built zsh binary:

...% ./dbg/bin/zsh -f
redoubt% PS1='%?[%y]%~%# '
0[ttyp4]~% cd /var/home/docs
0[ttyp4]/var/home/docs%     <hit enter to get a preserved line>
[type: cd ~<tab>]
0[ttyp4]/var/hocd ~
[hit ^C]
1[ttyp4]~docs% 

It looks as though the line-length gets recalculated and the post-prompt
stuff redrawn without the prompt being redrawn, so the text overlays the
prompt and everything is confusing and ugly.
