My view was simply that it was a bit rich to expect those who've been
happily using the old behaviour all along suddenly to clutter up their
directories with new functions, particularly since it's *simpler* than
the behaviour now programmed.  I don't have any problem using the
function myself, except of course I have to export it to every
computer I can find and I never do that consistently, but then I never
install new versions of zsh consistently anyway.

Yes, particularly aliases (I can put with `command ls', but `command
'ls'' is going too far), but as was pointed out not long ago that's
already rather heavily hard-wired into the lexical analyser.

As I sort of hint at somewhere in the FAQ, it's a little late to worry
about this now.  It does mean getting the defaults right is important,
though (and I still suggest turning alwayslastprompt on by default
would be a good idea).
