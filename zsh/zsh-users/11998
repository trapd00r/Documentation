} If you're talking about prompt themes supplied with zsh, I would
} consider it a bug in the package if those aren't defined that way.

Most of the prompt themes pre-date the existence of the pre*_functions
arrays, and aren't being maintained because their inventors are no longer
zsh-* list participants.

Stomping precmd is the least of the problems with several of those
themes; they rely on now-ancient Linux console fonts for color shading,
assume light-colored text on a dark background, etc.  We need some new
ones.
