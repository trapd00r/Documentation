Quote from the Solaris 2.4 fdopen manual:

     When opened, a stream is fully buffered if and  only  if  it
     can  be  determined  not  to refer to an interactive device.
     The error and end-of-file indicators  are  cleared  for  the
     stream.

The patch below should fix this.  Note that here setvbuff is called with
NULL buffer and if _IOFBF is not defined setbuffer is not called.  That's
because this problem seems to affect only SVR4 systems where setvbuf and
_IOFBF is always defined.  And setvbuf used to be called with NULL buffer
but the Linux libc-5.3.6 and earlier versions had a bug that setvbuf with
NULL buffer did not work on unbuffered streams.  But Linux fdopen always
gives a buffered stream so that is not a problem here and libc older than
5.3.12 is obsolate anyway :-).
