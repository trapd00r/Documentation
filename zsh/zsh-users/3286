I had a similar problem when I had some escape codes in my prompt, which set
the xterm title bar. I think zsh calculates the cursor position depending on
the length of the prompt. Of course, zsh did not understand that a certain
part of the text actually appeared in the title bar and not in the command
line prompt and therefore assumed a wrong length andq set the cursor to a
wrong position.
