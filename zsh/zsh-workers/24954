Note that POSIX requires mv to be able to move files (and now
directories) accross file systems. Note that it's quite a
complex task as it involves recreating the files as they were
(permissions, ownership, ACLs, sparse files), handle conflicts,
handle hard links correctly, and handle the error cases
properly. It's not as simple as cp+rm, it would rather be pax
-rw && rm -rf
