    The above, when run after "zsh -f" and making sure you don't have
any /etc/zshenv not protected by "[[ -o rcs ]]", causes a hangup (not
a crash) in my system. Unfortunately the crash happens randomly, and
seldom. The common case is a hangup, with zsh eating lots of CPU, but
from time to time it crashes.

    With 3 column width you can call "ls" if your PS1 is short enough
XDDDD. BTW, this has happened to me with COLUMNS=100 and a very long
file name, that's why I discovered it. First zsh messed up the
screen, and when I hit <UP> the shell crashed. I haven't been able to
reproduce the crash with that particular example, zsh always hangs
now, but I have had crashes and hangs with the example I provide
above.

    Exactly. Any filename whose name length is greater or equal to
$COLUMNS seems to cause the problem.
