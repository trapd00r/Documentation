    Hi Bart :)

    And that's (almost) true. A bit unexpected, maybe.

    OK, I was supposing that the code that interpreted EOF wasn't at
the same level than the code that interpreted exit or logout, but I
wasn't sure...

    OK. I was testing with just one command O:)

    If EOF is intended as a synonim for 'exit', yes, it's a bug.
Otherwise...

    Nice, thanks, but I think I must get used to use 'exit' or
'logout' instead of EOF... It's a bad habit anyway, because sometimes
I've exited a terminal accidentally with backgrounded jobs because
I've hitted ^D twice due to a bad finger movement (a trembling
finger...). Using a command to exit is less error-prone.

    Thanks :))
