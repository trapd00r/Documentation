You get that behaviour with "print".  It deliberately doesn't do that
with echo for compatibility; there are lots of variants of echo around.

You're turning on zsh in standards-compliant mode (such as it is :-/)
and demanding that it doesn't respect the standard.  If you want to be
able to run things the same way on multiple shells, you *have* to be
able to accept standard behaviour, you don't have a choice.
