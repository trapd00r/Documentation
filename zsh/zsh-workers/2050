This is an autoconf bug but only happens with obsolate libc versions like
5.0.9 which used some preprocessor hacks on lstat because of some
incompatible kernel changes made sometime between linux-1.0 and linux-1.2.
Recent libc's use elf hacks to solve the problem.  You should better
upgrade your libc and your kernel.  It is also mentioned in Etc/MACHINES.
