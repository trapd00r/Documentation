Mission accomplished ;->

'Tis done.  I'll let you know when the SourceForge admins have
approved the request (assuming they do).  It should be within 24 hours
or so.  In the meantime, it would be good if everyone who hasn't
already got one creates themselves a SourceForge account.  Don't
worry; this is a remarkably painless operation and takes hardly any
time.  Just go to

  https://sourceforge.net/account/register.php

I presume everyone has access to an SSL-enabled browser?

Peter, once you've got an account I'll transfer the relevant project
administrator privileges to you.  Bart, I presume you won't want to
bother making a CVS tree for 3.0.x available, but if you do, let me
know and I'll give you admin privileges too.  Of course, once we have
the repository up and running smoothly, there's no technical
limitation preventing us from having several developers with commit
access to the development tree, but I'll assume that we want to carry
on with Peter as the sole "patch pumpking" unless I hear otherwise.

By the way, the home page is at 

  http://sourceforge.net/ 

if you want to have a look round, although I'm sure you already
figured that out.

Yep, we definitely need to move all the individual copyrights into
LICENSE or Etc/LICENSE or something.  That's going to be a fun job for
someone :-/
