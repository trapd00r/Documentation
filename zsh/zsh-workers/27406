I traced the problem a bit further into the comparguments C code, and
it got pretty hopeless at that point just trying to read the code.  If
I could easily locate the code that's matching the parsed definitions
against the word to be completed, maybe that would help.  It seems
like maybe it's in ca_parse_line.. I guess next step is to attach gdb
and step through that.
