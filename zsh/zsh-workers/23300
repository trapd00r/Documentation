Oops yes, brain slow in the morning again.

It is probably either mutt or yahoo (on my end). The
attached email follows your email in my mailbox. It looks like
the "\nFrom " has not been escaped as "\n>From " and the
"Lines:" and "Content-Length" headers in your email don't
englobe the attachment, so that mutt sees it as 2 messages.
That's an old version of mutt, I just probably need to upgrade.

So it seems to be exclusively on my end.

Sorry for noise.

Cheers,
Stéphane
