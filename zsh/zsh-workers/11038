What I believe to be the status on these issues.  New ones:

11036		read -q
11030		_message
11023		_complete_help and matcher-list
11022		print -s (during completion)
11018		_find

Yeah, I know, it's not fair to list things that came up over the weekend.
Too bad, I want to collect them together somewhere.  (I suppose I could
file them as bugs on sourceforge ... do people find that bug tracker to
be worthwhile?)

The following have been fixed or acted upon, or were improperly listed:

} 10187		combining multiple zstyle commands into one
} 10154		$param:x and the FAQ
} 8698		bad node type in freenode (related to 9095?)
} 8619		locales and globbing
} Document the kshautoload problem with the completion system and how one
} works around it with zcompile.

The following are going to be left as they are in 3.1.7-pre-2, so that
counts as a resolution:

} users/2973	clear to end of display
} 10403		<(...) doesn't really create a FIFO
	(This one got some documentation at least.  I still think it
	could be fixed, but probably not entirely within getproc(),
	due to the race condition PWS noted.)
} 10071		xtrace behavior of `.' and `source'
} 10005		bogus "no such job" / STAT_NOPRINT
	(I guess that's what Sven's "Sniff." meant.)
} 9996		vared keymap
} 9945		somebody check my work ...
} 9062		suspending `.' / `source'

The following will be dealt with for 4.0, along with other reorgs:

} 10080		move compctl support functions out of Misc/
} 9962		renumbering comptest

The following have been discussed a bit further, but no conclusion yet:

} 10346		rebuilding zshpaths.h
} 9778		hanging on loops with lots of output
} 8780		format of error messages

And last, these are still entirely un-addressed:

} 10169		%(l.t.f) and line wrapping in prompts
} users/2979	assigning a string containing `:' to $path
} 9982		comptest (lack of) verbosity
} 9762		nameddir assoc elements
} 9702		configure switch for mymods.conf (cf. 9727)
} 9575		export arrays like ksh
} 9095		getopts is broken
} 9000		parameter formatting / ksh export (cf. 8674)
} 8861		posix module
} 8758		locales and math (cf. 8792)
} 8378		configure --zsh-mem-debug

Of those, I think 9095 is the only really crucial one.  The others might
warrant mention on the BUGS list or some such.
