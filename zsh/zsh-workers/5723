Subject: Problem with default expand-or-complete after latest patches
X-Authentication-Warning: c-bart.amazon.com: schaefer set sender to schaefer@tiny.zanshin.com using -f

Using 3.1.5-pws-11 with the patches Sven posted overnight (well, overnight
US Pacific Time) 3/8-3/9, I get this strange behavior:

zsh% fpath=($PWD:h<TAB>
zsh% fpath=(src/  

I expected to get "fpath=(/home/schaefer/src/" ...

Note that this is *not* using the new completion functions.
