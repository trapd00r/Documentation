Hi,

First, I'd like to thank the zsh developers for a wonderful shell.

Second, I'd like to ask if it's possible to key an array to a name?

I tried to create an associative array and assign it a key + regular
array, but that doesn't seem to work.

That is:

  typeset -A array
  array[key]=(lots of values here)

doesn't work.

Is there some other way I can use to achive the same thing?


Johann
