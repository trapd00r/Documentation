But this applies just as well to any other possible command that has GNU counterpart and
needs version check. What is so different with diff?

Nope. I do want

compdef _diff diff gdiff

without bothering, if GNU diff is installed as main or additional program. The above will
cover 99.9% of installations.

I agree with the point, that _diff_options can be called in context without actual
command. But it simply means, that _diff_options should not test diff version itself, but
just get a "diff kind" parameter. Actual testing is to be done by _diff.
