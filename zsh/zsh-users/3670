OK, thanks for the explanation, and it works for me too when doing an
assignment.  But I do also sometimes want it to perform completion correctly
when completing a colon separated path on a cmd line (e.g., the -classpath
argument to java or jview).  Any way to force the same behavior in this
situation?

I've just noticed that using `setopt completeinword' seems to allow me to
complete using TAB rather than expand-or-complete-prefix.
