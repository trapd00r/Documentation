In what way doesn't it work under xterm.  On what architecture? What OS?
After the subshell patch, what is going wrong?

I've given up trying to estimate when we will release the next production
version of zsh (which will be labeled zsh-3.0).  Since zsh has gotten a
reputation for being buggy, I want to make sure things are ultra-solid
before we make our production release.  Maybe in 3 or 4 months, but no
promises.
