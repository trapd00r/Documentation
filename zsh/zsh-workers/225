I think that =1 is easy to type (no shift key).  I think that ~1 is a little more annoying (1 shift).  But I think that ~+1 is too cumbersome, IMHO.

Consider this:
=n is an absolute directory reference which corresponds directly to the directory stack, ie:

src/gnu Mon 17 13:59 % dirs -v
0       /pd/src/gnu
1       ~csim
2       ~
src/gnu Mon 17 13:59 % echo =1
/vobs/devel/shared/hsd100/sim

~+1 and ~-1 would refer to relative entries on the directory stack.  I prefer the absolute naming scheme, personally.
