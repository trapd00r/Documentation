This will break for old things like opensolaris' /bin/sh.
If you leave the 'command' bit out, it'll work:

    which most >/dev/null && { PAGER=most; export PAGER; }

Yeah, an alias or a function called 'which' would break that. But it's
more portable than the 'command' approach.

However, since this is a zsh list, most people probably don't care.
And they shouldn't. :-)
