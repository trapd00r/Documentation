    Cool, since my idea of tieing both variables won't work because
the joining character is a colon and not an space :(((

    Not a problem, since I already do this with PATH and path, for
example. In fact is a pro, because I do that automatically ;)

    For me it is right, but I must confess I have interest in it ;)))
Although I cannot use that with my current zsh version, it doesn't
matter really since I don't modify the variables (on normal use, I
mean), and I can set both variables by hand in my /etc/zshenv. But
I'm ready for a new Zsh version ;))))
