} Is this a bug, or is there some behavior I'm not understanding properly?

It's a bug.  The optimization that causes $(<filename) to be implmented
without forking is not properly saving/restoring some state, such that
the expansion of $$ in the file name causes zsh to behave as if you'd
written it with double quotes, i.e. `print -l ${"$(</proc/$$/environ)"}'.

This bug doesn't exist in 3.0.x because the state that needs to be saved
and restored wasn't introduced until 3.1.9-pws-19.  However, the bug has
probably been present ever since then -- for more than two years.

The following would appear to be the fix.  "make check" still passes.
