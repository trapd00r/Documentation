I'm using it for simplified hierarchies.  ~[p] means my normal Perforce
client, ~[p1] my alternative one, so ~[p:u] is
/home/pws/perforce/uwb/main/fw/src while ~[p1:u] is
/home/pws/perforcel1/uwb/main/fw/src, and so on.  In other words, I can
replace multiple chunks in the directory path very briefly; I could only
do that with static names by naming every possible combination.

See my previous post for how I'm doing completion on these.
