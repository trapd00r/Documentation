It is set by default in a zsh that supports the option.  If I run
"unsetopt | fgrep copy", I see "nohistsavebycopy", which means that
the option is enabled (i.e. that "unsetopt nohistsavebycopy" is what
is currently in effect, and thus the double-negation of that command,
"setopt histsavebycopy", is also in effect).
