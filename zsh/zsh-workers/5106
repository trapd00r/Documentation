Hi,

I tried 3.1.5 without the dynamic stuff on Alpha Linux with egcs. It
crashes when pressing tab after "man" with the example man
completion. This happens on both egcs 1.0.3 and 1.1.1, but not on
either with -O0, so it seems like a compiler bug.

Does anybody else have an Alpha Linux system and could check this?

I will try to track it with a debugger.

	Falk
