Yes, you're right. And i think i now why. The output of genmultilib is different
when executed by zsh or bash. It seems genmultilib use the $options variable to
store the first positional parameter to genmultilib, and i'm sure you've guessed
it, $options is already defined by zsh. I'm going to test multilib now with a
different name instead of options, but i'm pretty sure this it's what is causing
the problem.
