I'm used to the current behaviour but don't take my objections too
seriously.  I'm now leaning heavily towards your version's behaviour.
I guess I can learn some new skills :-)

My csh manual says:
 "Remove a trailing `.xxx' component, leaving the root name."

:thoses modifiers do (r-root e-extension h-head t-tail).

Yes, I suppose "root name" should be sufficient and I don't really
think we need to explain what it means (nobody else does).
