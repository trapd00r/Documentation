Subject: alias -s doesn't friendly deal with programs having an extension

Hi, ZSH workers,

after alias pl=perl e.g.
a program with an extension like  e.g. program.pl can no
longer be invoked without its full path.

Could the alias -s functionality be improved so that it
first looks for programs in the $PATH with extensions and
only after it does not find the invoked program THEN
use the mechanism?

        Matthias

        PS: I guess the old priority of first replacing
        aliases with what they stand for goes against this
