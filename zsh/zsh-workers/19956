If you rebuild the deb with DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS="debug", you'll get some
more verbose output from gdb.

zsh doesn't call mallopt() directly; it's probably being called from
another libc function such as free().  Can you repeat the problem under
valgrind with appropriate options?  Does it reveal anything?
