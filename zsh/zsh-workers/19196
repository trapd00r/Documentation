    Hi all :)

    In Src/Modules/zpty.c you assume that /dev/ptmx is available only
if __SVR4, __sinix or __CYGWIN__ is defined. It's available too in
recent Linux. More specifically, in recent glibc's, so you should add
a test for __GLIBC__ , being __GLIBC__ at least 2, and __GLIBC_MINOR__
at least 1.

    Currently, under my Linux, which supports UNIX98 pseudoterminals,
/dev/pty?? is used instead :(((( And fails since I don't have
/dev/pty nodes O:)))
