Subject: ignore classes of files for completion on a per directory basis?
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Content-Disposition: inline
X-Virus-Scanned: ClamAV 0.92.1/7680/Thu Jul 10 01:31:16 2008 on bifrost
X-Virus-Status: Clean

I would like to setup completion to ignore a certain group of files
(say, those with an underscore in the file names) when I am trying to
complete when in a specific directory. What makes this tricky is that
I may not want those same filenames (those with underscores in them)
in a neighboring subdirectory to be ignored for completion.

I know it's possible to configure completion to ignore a pattern of
filenames globally, but how about on a per-directory basis?

thanks in advance.
