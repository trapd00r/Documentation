I do see the following command in run_masterfile_step:

  this=3D`basename $0`

but no references at all to 'nofunctionargzero' in my init files.

-n.

OK, the problem seems very strange, so here goes a _very_ wild guess:
Does "run_masterfile_step" evaluate $0 sometimes and there is now a
"setopt nofunctionargzero" somewhere in you .zshrc (or another
init-file) that wasn't there before?

CU,
Thomas
