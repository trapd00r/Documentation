Subject: PATCH: 3.1.6-pws-6: $compstate[unambiguous] could be garbage
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Earlier today I started noticing

_main_complete: 95: bad set of key/value pairs for associative array

Line 95 is copying the entire $compstate assoc int $lastcomp.  I eventually
tracked the problem to the value of `unambiguous' which it seemed was being
dropped from the ${(@kv)compstate} expansion.  Turns out the reason it was
being dropped is that it pointed to a garbage string because unambig_data()
was being called twice and was freeing and reallocating the cached value
each time; the string returned the first time ended up pointing into free
memory.

I don't know whether the `|| !ainfo' is necessary in the patch below, but
it seemed safest to have it there.  It was always nonzero in the bug case,
but I didn't go through every possible call to the function.
