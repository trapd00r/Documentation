Indeed, this fixed my problem, and I also renamed the function to
something else, now that I found out about the nameclash. Warnings
would be nice.

However, there still seems to be some regression, but I cannot quite
reproduce this for other cases. E.g. it is still possible to define
a function -F without the error.
