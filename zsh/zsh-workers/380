When sourcing the file .zsh_env below with Z-Shell 2.5.03 on a Sparc 20,
I get a bus-error:

.zsh_env:
source ~/.zshaliases
if (test -z $HOME/bin); then echo yep; fi


.zshaliases looks like this:
echo "testmark"

If I comment out the echo in .zshaliases, everything works?!
If I comment out either line in .zsh_env or I rename
the files everything works, too?

I don't load any .zshrc-File and start zsh from a T-CShell, could
that be the problem?

Bye
  Thomas
