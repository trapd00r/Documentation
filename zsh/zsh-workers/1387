I have a similar problem when telnet-ing from a misconfigured network,
with terminal-type dec-vt220 (instead of just vt220). Now I have in
.zlogin something like:
case "$TERM" in
   dec-vt*) TERM=vt100 ;;
   [...]
esac

but it still complains "can't find termcap info for dec-vt220" and
then works normally after the resetting in .z*.
