This is not correct.

In http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007904975/utilities/printf.html:

The `OPTIONS' section of the printf description says `None'.

http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007904975/utilities/xcu_chap01.html#tag_01_11
describes what this means:

Default Behavior: When this section is listed as "None.", it means
that the implementation need not support any options.  Standard
utilities that do not accept options, but that do accept operands,
shall recognize "--" as a first argument to be discarded.
