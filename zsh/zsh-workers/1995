This is not a zsh bug.  ping dumps core,  and zsh prints:

zsh: 336 segmentation fault (core dumped)  /usr/sbin/ping -s www.americanexpress.com

The zsh: means that it was zsh which printed the message but at the end of the
message you can see what caused the coredump.

Of course Linux ping works fine.  It's time to upgrade to SparcLinux :-).
