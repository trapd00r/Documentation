Is there any way to turn off the "zsh: you have running jobs." message
that appears when you try to exit zsh with jobs in the background?  I
have the "nohup" option set so that zsh won't kill those jobs, but I'd
like to be able to exit the shell without being nagged about running
jobs.

Also...

When zsh has multiple completion possibilities, it gives the the
error:

zsh: do you wish to see all <n> possibilities?

What is the minimum value of n such that this message will appear?  Can
I change this value or disable the message entirely?

Steve
