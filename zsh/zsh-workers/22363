$ which awk
/usr/bin/awk
$ awk -v
UX:awk: ERROR: No program given
$ awk -help
UX:awk: WARNING: Unknown option -help ignored
UX:awk: ERROR: No program given
$ awk -V
UX:awk: WARNING: Unknown option -V ignored
UX:awk: ERROR: No program given

Doesn't help much :)

SIGNAL_H=3D'/usr/include/internal/signal_core.h'

configure:11345: result: no
configure:11366: checking what style of signals to use
configure:11397: result: POSIX_SIGNALS
configure:11400: checking where signal.h is located
configure:11439: result: /usr/include/internal/signal_core.h

And I do have:

$ grep -i signal config.h
/* Define to 1 if you use BSD style signal handling (and can block=20
signals).
/* #undef BSD_SIGNALS */
/* Define to 1 if `ru_nsignals' is member of `struct rusage'. */
#define HAVE_STRUCT_RUSAGE_RU_NSIGNALS 1
/* Define to 1 if you have no signal blocking at all (bummer). */
/* #undef NO_SIGNAL_BLOCKING */
/* Define to 1 if you use POSIX style signal handling. */
#define POSIX_SIGNALS 1
/* Define as the return type of signal handlers (`int' or `void'). */
/* Define to 1 if you use SYS style signal handling (and can block=20
signals).
/* #undef SYSV_SIGNALS */
/* Define to `unsigned int' if <sys/types.h> or <signal.h> doesn't=20
define */
