Hi folks !

I wonder whether we could implement some data base completion.  What I
want to have is man page completion, but reading all the man pages from
an NFS server is very slow, and we have so many man pages installed that
I don't want zsh to keep the list in memory.

The newer Berkeley db library has a B-tree database type, which can be
searched the way we need to implement completion.  Wouldn't it be
possible to implement some database lookup completion ?  I'd like to
write a new man(1) which uses the database to find the man pages, and
I'd like to have zsh complete my man pages ;)

Felix
