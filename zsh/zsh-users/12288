You may also want to consider "mairix" for mail box indexing.
mairix integrates very well with mutt.

For those interested, I can share my mairix+zsh+mutt
customizations (where mairix is invoked within mutt via a zsh
script that handles a command line with history and completion).

Cheers,
Stephane
