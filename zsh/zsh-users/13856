Yes, but

while the above appears to work, it really doesn't:
% mkdir path/code/foo
% cd code/<tab>
---- local directory
foo/
---- directory in cdpath
bar/  foo/

Presumably this is because *(/) (which I changed to *(-/) (not in the
above testcase though)) only matches one segment and that *(/) is run
in $PWD, not $PWD/$PREFIX? I have not yet fully understood how this
works, can you access the string being completed in that code snippet,
or can you work around it without doing that? (This time I read both
the ignored-patterns and zstyle -e docs :) ).
