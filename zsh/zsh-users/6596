} Would always use _generic for that type of thing myself. Avoids the need
} for a separate function file:

Ah, yes, I'd completely (ahem) forgotten about _generic.

The only advantage to using a separate file is the automatic #compdef,
which isn't much advantage at all.

} zle -C case-sensitive complete-word _generic
} zstyle ':completion:case-sensitive::::' completer _expand _complete _ignored

In fact, you don't even need that style unless using an unusual set of
completers; this one is sufficient:

} zstyle ':completion:case-sensitive:*' matcher-list ''
