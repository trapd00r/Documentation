The problem with accented chars still exist, and this time also in
completion. If you try to complete the file "revalida\347\343o.tex"
(the \??? are the ascii spelling of the octal codes) it starts to
complete all files in the directory.

If you type the name directly such as in "tex revalida\347\343o.tex",
zsh cuts it before the first accented char, and thinks that "o.tex" is
another command.

This is after applying Peter's patch.
