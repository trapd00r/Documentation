} `Top level' means whatever's on the front of the list of EXIT traps.

Ah.  I'd have said

	trap 'print top-level' EXIT
	fn() {
	  trap 'print fn-level' EXIT
	  ( trap 'print subshell' EXIT )
	}

and in that sense the subshell can't possibly execute the top-level trap.
At the same time, but in another sense, `fn-level' and `subshell' are at
the same "level" there.

} The 4.0 behaviour is that only the explicit exit produces a trap; falling
} off the end of the subshell in `( true )' doesn't.  I would guess this is
} wrong and they should be equivalent.  That may require more special
} handling.

Hrm.
