Hi,

I'm running zsh 3.0.5 on a Solaris 2.4 and 2.6 machine, while attempting to
build a large C++ application with gcc -2.7.2.1 the compile exits
prematurly after attempting to link the resulting objects.  The program
uses HP STL (old Standard Template Library) and the -frepo compile option
to gcc.  (-frepo is used recompiling objects to allevitate the template
instantion problem - from what I understand.)

When I got to a fresh ksh with nothing int he evnironment, I'm able to
build and link the program just fine.

My question is why is this happening and how can I fix it ?  (I have 24
directories in my PATH!)  What contributes to this limit problem and is
there any way to increase the limit any more..

output from ulimit on sol 2.4 :

pts/1 zsh-3.0.5 > ulimit -a
cpu time (seconds)         unlimited
file size (blocks)         unlimited
data seg size (kbytes)     1024
stack size (kbytes)        8192
core file size (blocks)    unlimited
file descriptors           1024
virtual memory size (kb)   unlimited


Thanks in advance for any assistance,
greg
