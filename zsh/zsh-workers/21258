I don't think that's the problem.  intrap has a quite limited effect,
determining how the shell behaves when already handling signals.

The vague suspicion is that the problem is based on whether or not the
trap handler is run inside the signal handler, and whether the system
resets the signal.  It's possible to tweak the queueing code, which
would force more traps to be run after the handler exits rather than
within it, but I'm really not sure enough about what's going on to
suggest anything definite.
