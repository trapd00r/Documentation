When completing only directories.

You have every time you want or need, I don't think we really need to
do this before 3.1.7.

And, no, off the top of my head I can't think of places where
suffix-handling caused that much trouble.

Oh, and, btw, when thinking about suffix handling, we should probably
also re-think the -R stuff (auto-removal in general). Maybe we find
something better, maybe we don't...
