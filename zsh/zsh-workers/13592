Subject: 4.0.1-pre-2
Date: Thu, 08 Mar 2001 12:41:46 +0000
From: Peter Stephenson <pws@csr.com>

I've uploaded
  http://ftp.zsh.org/zsh/development/zsh-4.0.1-pre-2.tar.gz

The main change here is probably Sven's optimisations which should make
script execution rather faster.

I'll post a separate message to zsh users about the test releases.

	* unposted: Config/version.mk: 4.0.1-pre-2.

	files.

2001-03-08  Sven Wischnowsky  <wischnow@zsh.org>

	* 13591: Completion/User/_init_d: try to find out the sub commands

	* 13589: Src/mem.c, Src/parse.c, Src/zsh.h: two optimisations; use

 	pointer to newly allocated heaps to avoid having to search for a
 	heap with free space in most cases
	
2001-03-07  Andrej Borsenkow <bor@zsh.org>

	* unposted: configure.in, aczsh.m4: support building with
	GCC on ReliantUNIX; use AC_TRY_COMMAND for better diagnostic

	* 13575: Src/Zle/compmatch.c: another fix for completion matching,
 	CLF_MISS in the wrong cline struct
	
2001-03-06  Andrej Borsenkow <bor@zsh.org>

	of Geoff) for me :-)
