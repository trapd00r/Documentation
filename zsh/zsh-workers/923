Several people have report zsh hanging in attachtty.  Peter
sent in a patch that changes

if (kill(pgrp, 0) == -1)

to

if (pgrp != mypgrp && kill(pgrp, 0) == -1)

Now I'm trying to understand what is going on.

1) Where is attachtty being called from when it
   hanges (init_io, init_signals, etc...)?

2) Does anyone know why the original call to set the
   foreground process is failing?
