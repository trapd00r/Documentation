He said "numeric", but you may be right.
=20
} By the way, are those normal:
}=20
} $ echo $((40#^))
} 39
}=20
} (given that ^ is also an arithmetic operator)?

% typeset -i 40 x
% x=3D39
% echo $x
40#^

Zsh is choosing "^" to represent 39 in base 40 because carat is the 29th
ASCII character after capital A, so the base 40 "digits" are
    0123456789ABC...XYZ[\]^

Some pretty strange stuff happens with bases larger than 200 where the
available range of "digits" runs out.  There should probably at least be
a warning about that somewhere.

There's definitely some other funny parsing going on here:

% echo $((##v))=20
118
% echo $((##0))
48
% echo $((##v - ##0))
70
% echo $((##^))=20=20=20=20=20=20
94
% echo $((##^ - ##0))
-48
% echo $(((##v) - (##0)))=20=20=20=20
70
% echo $(((##^) - (##0)))
zsh: ')' expected
% echo $[ $((##^)) - $((##0)) ]
46

} $ echo $((02#11))
} 3
} $ setopt octalzeroes
} $ echo $((02#11))
} zsh: bad math expression: operator expected at `#11'
} $
}=20
} --=20
} St=E9phane
}-- End of excerpt from Stephane Chazelas
