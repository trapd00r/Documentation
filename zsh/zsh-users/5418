I missed that.  Thanks for the tip, The quote insertion is neat!

The url-magic-space has some interesting behavior dont know if you
noticed:

* hit a space at beginning of the prompt result in 2 spaces.  However,
  another space will remove the leading two spaces.  As a result, if I
  type: 'space cd /usr<CR>' when I have histignorespace on, it will
  insert the command into history because the leading space is
  magically disappeared.

* can not type multiple spaces at end of a line, even inside a quote,
  i.e., I can not do the following:

  > echo "testing    here" > file
