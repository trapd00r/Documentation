I changed form bash to zsh some time ago and it's been a pleasure to
use zsh. Except for one thing that irks me: Zsh clears the contents of
the line the prompt gets printed on. An example:

% echo -n "foo"
%

Bash handles this (IMO) more gracefully:

$ echo -n "foo"
foo$

The question is: can I turn this off in zsh? Is it a feature or a bug?

Regards,
Joel
