[... Brutal savaging of my version choped :) ]


        Thanks for critiquing it.  It was rather cargo cultish and
hacked together from the bits and pieces of whatever looked similar to 
what I was trying to do.  I better go re-read that section of the
guide a couple more times.

        I've been frustrated that TAB doesn't Do What I Mean for stuff 
in /etc/rc.d/init.d several times.  You almost could generate it on
the fly with a for over /etc/rc.d/init.d/*, maybe with a style for
things that take strange arguments other than start or stop.
