At first I thought you meant that {_Dbg_fd}>&- never worked, but now
I see you mean it complains when the fd has previously been closed.  

I suspect this is just a case of zsh being more vocal about a possible
error than ksh.  Closing an already closed fd _could_ be silently
ignored, which I imagine is what ksh is doing.

} I gather that closing _Dbg_fd for input also closes it for output.
} 
} Is this the expected or okay?

Yes on both counts.  A descriptor is either open or not.  If you want
separate read and write handles, you have to create them explicitly:

   exec {_Dbg_rfd}<&$_Dbg_fd
   exec {_Dbg_wfd}>&$_Dbg_fd
   exec {_Dbg_fd}<&-

It's also possible to do it explicitly, so having it happen implicitly
would be strange.

} I'm happy to hear alternative interpretations, of course.

It can't work differently without breaking a lot of stuff. It's quite
common for all of stdin/out/err to be open for both reading and writing
when the shell gets them.  If <&- closed only the "reading half" of fd
0, that descriptor slot would remain occupied and other scripts/programs
that rely on the "lowest available numbered descriptor is re-used on
next open" semantics would go haywire.

} If you didn't (i) people would forever be guessing which one they were

} "exec {fd}<&-" or vice versa (iii) it would be incompatible with what

And incompatible with the way the Bourne shell has worked for decades.
