I have a psgrep alias which I've been using on Solaris 2.4 regularily for
nearly a yer now.  I always use the most recent beta with my patches and I
never had any problems.  Here is the function I use:

psgrep  () {
	ps auwwx | egrep "(${*:-.})|^USER  " |
	egrep -v 'ps auwwx$|egrep .*\|.USER' | more
}

/usr/ucb is before /usr/bin and /bin in my path.

Bye,

Zoltan
