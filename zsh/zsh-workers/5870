(P) is used very early, after subscripting, before other
modifications. The fact that subscripting is done on the value of the
original parameter is slightly irritating, but one can always use
`${(P)${foo}[1]}' to make the subscript apply to the value of the
parameter that is finally used.
With (eP), the (e) is still aplied at the end, as always (i.e. there
is no special treatment for the combination).
