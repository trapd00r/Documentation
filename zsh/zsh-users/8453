} This looks suspiciously like a bug.

I *think* (not yet sure) this is happening because during interpretation
of the assignments,

	BAR=FOO echo $FOO $BAR

examines "echo" and decides it looks like a simple builtin command and
therefore should have variables restored afterwards, but

	FOO=BAR BAR=FOO echo $FOO $BAR

examines "BAR=FOO" and fails to reach the same conclusion.
