Hi,

 WARNING! NEWBIE QUESTION AHEAD! ;)

 Suppose I did the following:

		 a=( 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 )

 Now I want "b" to become equal to "a".

 I tried 

		 b=a

 which only copies the first element.

	   b=$( ${(@)a} )

 does also not work ("bad substitution").

 How can I copy one array to another?

 Thank you very much in advannce for any help!

 Keep zshing!
 mcc
