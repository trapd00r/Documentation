It's a bit ambiguous, it does say `command substitution' which always
implies word-splitting of unquoted words.  But you can take the reference
to `variable assignment' at the start to imply the result remains part of
the variable assignment.  And the question for us is really what POSIX
says.

We already check specially for tildes, I dare say this can be done, but
even so it's a rather confusing special case.  If we did this, I'd be
strongly inclined to upgrade MAGIC_EQUAL_SUBST along the same lines, so
that with the option set
  make MAKE_VARIABLE=`command subst`
had the same property.
