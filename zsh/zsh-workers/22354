Peter,

Peter Stephenson <pws@csr.com>:
] It's certainly not supposed to happen. Is MULTIBYTE_SUPPORT defined in
] config.h?

It is. Feel free to take a look at config.h, or anything else for that
matter, in the build directory <http://www.ixian.com/ead/tmp/zsh-4.3.2/>.
Following its creation, that directory has only had the commands noted
on lines 4-6 invoked within it:

1       ead% cd tmp
2       tmp% zcat zsh-4.3.2.tar.gz | tar -xvf -
3       tmp% cd zsh-4.3.2
4       zsh-4.3.2% ./configure --prefix=$HOME/local
5       zsh-4.3.2% make
6       zsh-4.3.2% make check

Regards,
Eric
