} _arguments doesn't work if the first argument doesn't exclude any other

} }
} compdef _foo foo
} foo -<tab>
} 
} This hangs until I press Ctrl-C.

The -m is being interpeted as an argument of _arguments, not as an argument
spec for what should be completed.  It looks like the -m option (formerly
used to initialize `ismulti') went away as of 11489.

} This bug was not caused by any of this mornings patches

Based on _complete_debug output and "cvs diff" it certainly appears to
have been caused by one of today's patches.  Try this.
