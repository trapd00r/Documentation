Subject: (Newbie) perldoc ESC display trouble
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Hi,

I've recently switched to zsh on cygwin. I get display trouble in the form of expanded escape characters, ie ESC[1m Some Text [0m, when using perldoc.

For example:

> perldoc Getopt::Long
Getopt::Long(3)       User Contributed Perl Documentation      Getopt::Long(3)



ESC[1mNAMEESC[0m
       Getopt::Long - Extended processing of command line options

ESC[1mSYNOPSISESC[0m


The escaped sections should be dispalyed as bold.

Any suggestions, pointers to documentation, etc, very welcome,

TIA,

Richard
