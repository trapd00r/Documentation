} I mentioned this a while ago, but can't find that in the archive, because I
} can never find things.

I frequently do searches that I *know* should succeed, but that find
nothing.  I suppose I should send a couple of them off to Geoff and
ask why.

} For some reason, parentheses are treated specially in the command word in
} zsh, not just at the start (where, of course, they start a subshell).

I think know why, but perhaps now the lexer is more sophisticated.  I have
an early-morning meeting today, so I don't have time to build pws-21 and
try the patch.

They're treated that way because array assignments are in command position.
