$identifier[subscript] is an array expression.  When $identifier is a
scalar, it does character-wise indexing to extract substrings.

"1" is not an identifier.  $1 is a special case of expansion used for
the positional parameters.  So $1[anything] is not an array expression,
it's the expression $1 followed by the string [anything].  Similarly,
$1foo is ${1}foo because "1foo" is not an identifier, but "foo1" is an
identifier so $foo1 is the same as ${foo1}.

You can force indexing into $1 by ${1[subscript]}.
