:+Version Suffixes
:+----------------
:+The configure script reads the version number from Config/version.mk.
:+If the environment variable ZSH_EXTRAVERSION is set, the string
:+contained therein will be appended to the version string.  For example,
:+if Config/version.mk contains "VERSION=4.3.4-dev-7" and
:+ZSH_EXTRAVERSION is set to "-ca", $ZSH_VERSION in the shell built from
:+that run will equal "4.3.4-dev-7-ca".  Caution is recommended when
:+using this feature, as is-at-least may misunderstand your conventions.

Wouldn't it be nicer to call this ZSH_VERSIONSUFFIX?  IMO, it's a name
which is clearer about its function.

Geoff
