} 
} Loading limit and ulimit, like sched, is transparent.  I think the
} idea was simply to move as much that was not part of the core shell
} into modules.

I thought the docs treated as a builtin any module that was in the
default list to be linked in when building with --enable-static; but
that doesn't doesn't seem to be true of sched.  Maybe sched wasn't
always in modules-bltn?
