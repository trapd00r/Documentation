You can try:

    alias -g /dev/stderr=/dev/fd/2

} I understand that Bash has built in /dev/*

There is not, but zsh already has builtin handling of /dev/fd/N.

Note that neither bash nor zsh can help if you are passing /dev/stderr or
/dev/fd/N as a filename argument to a command, rather than using it as the
target of a redirection.
