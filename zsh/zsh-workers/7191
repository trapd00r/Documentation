After looking into it, there is dlopen(3) in HP-UX 11.00... :-)
 
 dlopen(3C)                                                       dlopen(3C)

 NAME
      dlopen - open a shared object

 SYNOPSIS
      cc [flag ... ] file ...  -ldl [library] ...

      #include <dlfcn.h>
      void *dlopen(const char *file, int mode);

They even now seem to support LD_LIBRARY_PATH...
