I've noticed this myself; I get an error when I interrupt it while it's
waiting to accept a connection, which is fairly unhelpful since I know I've
interrupted it.

It probably needs to have more detailed status return values and to ensure
ERRNO is accurate, plus a non-verbose option which (given that this is a
fairly low level utility) really ought to be the default; but as long as
there's an option when opening the session it's good enough.
