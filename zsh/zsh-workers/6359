Reinstalling one of my machines I took the chance to try compinstall. I
noted, that it takes given paths literally: I was in home and used

source .zsh.d/compinstall

that resulted in relative paths placed in .zshrc:

. .zsh.d/compinit -f .zsh.d -d

this 'course fails, if you start zsh from any other dir :-(
