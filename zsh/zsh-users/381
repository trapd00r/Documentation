I have the following at the top of my .zshrc :

if [[ $TERM = "xterm" ]] && [[ "`stty size`" != "8 57" ]] then
    export PROMPT="%{^[]2;%m:%~%%^G%}%B[%?:%!]%b%# "
else
  export PROMPT='%B%m%b:%~%# '
  export RPROMPT='[%?:%!]'
fi

the bit of interest is the ^[]2; ...  which puts the enclosed text in the
title bar of an xterm or screen screen.

don't know about HPUX tho ...
