} So the mark should be attached to the preceding character, rather than the
} following?  If that is the correct semantic then spaceinline() is broken.

I don't know if "attached to the preceding character" is the right way to

additional characters are inserted, the mark should definitely be "left
behind" as point moves away.

I believe I remarked upon this once before ... ah, yes:
