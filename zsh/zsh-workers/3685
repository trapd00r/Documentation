Yes, we should always handle it properly, as if this were done.

I suspect that it will make little performance difference in the majority
of cases.  It would, however, cause serious portability problems, if
we tried to use the system's regexp library.  Many regexp libraries
don't actually have the power of zsh glob patterns for patten matching,
to say nothing of **/.

                                                           and will give

In what respect?
