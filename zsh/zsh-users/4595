Here is what I do on my IRIX-6.5 box

./.preconfig

note that I want to have my zsh-related files in the /usr/PRIVATE  tree
You probably want to use a different path.

 CFLAGS=-O3 LDFLAGS=-s DLLDFLAGS='-shared -L/usr/PRIVATE/lib -rpath /usr/PRIVATE/lib' \
  nice ./configure --prefix=/usr/PRIVATE \
   --enable-dynamic \
   --enable-zshenv=/usr/PRIVATE/etc/zshenv   --enable-zshrc=/usr/PRIVATE/etc/zshrc \
   --enable-zlogin=/usr/PRIVATE/etc/zlogin   --enable-zprofile=/usr/PRIVATE/etc/zprofile \
   --enable-zlogout=/usr/PRIVATE/etc/zlogout --enable-etcdir=/usr/PRIVATE/etc/Zsh_Functions

This work for the current (i.e. CVS) version and has been working since
years.

(I wouldn't use  gcc-3.1 (to be) since I get problems with some
packages)
