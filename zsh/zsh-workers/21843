    I certainly have a couple of spare eyeballs here, and maybe the
spare minutes too, but I'm in no way familiar with zsh source code,
so I don't think that I can discover anything you haven't discovered
yet. In fact I think that you may discover and fix the problem by the
time I end studiying complist.c :( I know it's only 3k lines, but
it's full of one-letter variables and almost no comments, so I would
need much time to read and fully understand it (or maybe not fully
understand, but understand enough to not introduce new and nasty bugs
while trying to fix this one).

    OTOH, what I can for sure do is to test any change you may want
to test, in as many conditions as I can afford, and if I have time
this weekend I can try to pin down the bug with gdb and lots of
patience I suppose.

    Thanks for all your effort, Bart :)
