Subject: var expansion in glob pattern?

Most of my mail folders are small -
usually just questions and
answers about some program.

so I tried to run a quick statistics
on my Mail directory using the zsh
and its file globbing by size:

  $ cd ~/Mail
  $ for i in 1 2 3 4 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 35 40 45 50; do
      ls *(.Lk-$i)|wc -l
    end
  zsh: parse error near `end'

as you can see, it failed.
i suppose there is no variable
substitution inside globbing brackets.
but I'm sure there must be a way.
any hints?

Sven
