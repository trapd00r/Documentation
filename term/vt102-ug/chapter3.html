<H2 ID="S3.1">General</H2>
<P>SET-UP lets you select many VT102 features to configure the terminal for
specific applications. This chapter describes SET-UP and each of the
SET-UP features.</P>
<H2 ID="S3.2">SET-UP</H2>
<P>In SET-UP, you can select features at the keyboard. Current feature selections
appear on the screen. Two SET-UP displays show the features selections
- SET-UP A and SET-UP B (<A HREF="figure3-1a.html">Figure 3-1</A>). The first display (SET-UP
A) shows the location of the tab stops selected. A visual ruler numbers
each column. The second display (SET-UP B) shows the other SET-UP
features.</P>
<H2 ID="S3.3">Selecting Features</H2>
<P>You can select SET-UP features at the keyboard or with the computer.
When you select features at the keyboard, the terminal must be in SET-UP.
The terminal can enter SET-UP while on-line or off-line.</P>
<P>Entering SET-UP cancels print operations. If KBD LOCKED is on, the terminal
erases the keyboard buffer before transmission. Exiting SET-UP
turns off KBD LOCKED. Change the SET-UP feature selections by using
the following general procedure.</P>

</TABLE>
<H2 ID="S3.5">Feature Types</H2>
<P>SET-UP features change how the terminal operates. They allow you to
configure the terminal to operator preferences, and they provide compatibility
with the computer and ac power source. <A HREF="table3-2.html">Table 3-2</A> divides the
SET-UP features into three types: operator preference, communication
compatibility, and installation.</P>
<H3 ID="S3.5.1">Operator Preference Features</H3>
<P>These features configure the terminal to operator preferences. They do
not affect information transferred between the terminal, computer, and
printer.</P>
<H3 ID="S3.5.2">Communication Compatibility Features</H3>
<P>These features configure the terminal for compatibility with a computer
and optional serial printer. There are many combinations of SET-UP features
used when communicating. An error in these selections may stop
communication or transfer incorrect information between the terminal,
computer, and printer.</P>
<P CLASS="note">NOTE: This chapter describes the SET-UP features used to provide
compatibility. See <A HREF="chapter6.html">Chapter 6</A> for more information about using these SET-UP
features.</P>
<H3 ID="S3.5.3">Installation Features</H3>
<P>These features configure the terminal for operation in different installations.
If the terminal location changes, you must verify these feature selections.</P>
<H2 ID="S3.6">Feature Descriptions</H2>
<P>The following descriptions group SET-UP features by the SET-UP display
in which they appear. There are three types: general SET-UP features (in
any SET-UP display), SET-UP A features, and SET-UP B features.</P>
<P>Each section begins with a general procedure for changing each SET-UP
feature in that SET-UP display. Where needed, the SET-UP feature descriptions
provide more detail.</P>
<H3 ID="S3.6.1">General SET-UP Features</H3>
<P>You can change the on/off line and screen brightness SET-UP features in
any SET-UP display. Dedicated keys select these features. Each feature
description includes the specific procedure used to select the feature.</P>
<H4 ID="S3.6.1.1">On/Off Line</H4>
<P>This feature places the terminal either on-line or off-line
(<A HREF="figure3-4.html">Figure 3-4</A>). While on-line, ON LINE is on and the terminal can communicate
with the computer. The terminal transmits keyboard entries to the
computer and displays characters received from the computer on the screen.</P>
<P>When switched off-line, the terminal disconnects from the communication
line and erases both the input and keyboard character buffers. While off-line,
OFF LINE is on and the terminal cannot communicate with the computer.
The terminal does not transmit keyboard entries, but displays them
on the screen. Select on-line or off-line by using the following procedure.</P>
<P CLASS="note">NOTE: When the disconnect character enable SET-UP feature is on, perform
a long break disconnect before switching the terminal off-line. See
<A HREF="chapter6.html">Chapter 6</A> for more information about performing a long break disconnect.</P>

number. For example, switch 3-2 is the second switch from the left in the
third group. Following these features, the text describes the modem and
printer interface features. The answerback feature is the last feature described.</P>
<H4 ID="S3.6.3.1">Scroll <SPAN CLASS="notoc">(Switch 1-1: 0 = Jump, 1 = Smooth)</SPAN></H4>
<P>Scrolling is the upward or
downward movement of existing lines on the screen. Scrolling makes
room for new lines at the bottom or top of the screen. There are two methods
of scrolling, jump scroll or smooth scroll.</P>
<P>Jump scroll displays new lines on the screen as fast as received. You
should select jump scroll when using half-duplex communication or full-duplex
communication without XON/XOFF support.</P>
<P>Smooth scroll limits the speed at which new lines can appear. Therefore,
the movement of lines occurs at a smooth, steady rate. This makes the
lines displayed on the screen easier to read.</P>
<H4 ID="S3.6.3.2">Auto Repeat <SPAN CLASS="notoc">(Switch 1-2: 0 = Off, 1 = On)</SPAN></H4>
<P>This feature repeats a key
automatically, when you hold it down for more than one-half second. Keys
auto repeat at the rate of about 30 times per second. Auto repeat affects
all keyboard keys except <SPAN CLASS="keyname">SET-UP</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="keyname">ESC</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="keyname">RETURN</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="keyname">ENTER</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="keyname">NO SCROLL</SPAN>,
and <SPAN CLASS="keyname">CTRL</SPAN> with another key. When this feature is off, keys do not auto repeat.</P>
<H4 ID="S3.6.3.3">Screen Background <SPAN CLASS="notoc">(Switch 1-3: 0 = Dark, 1 = Light)</SPAN></H4>
<P>This feature

<H4 ID="S3.6.3.4">Cursor <SPAN CLASS="notoc">(Switch 1-4: 0 = Underline, 1 = Block)</SPAN></H4>
<P>This feature provides a
choice between two cursor displays. The cursor indicates the active
screen position (where the next character will appear). The cursor is either
a blinking underline (_) or blinking block (<IMG SRC="blocksmall.png" ALT="[]" HEIGHT="15" WIDTH="12">).</P>
<H4 ID="S3.6.3.5">Margin Bell <SPAN CLASS="notoc">(Switch 2-1: 0 = Off, 1 = On)</SPAN></H4>
<P>This feature generates a
bell tone when the cursor moves past the eighth character position from
the end of the line. The margin bell can turn on or off. Margin bell volume is
not adjustable.</P>
<P CLASS="note">NOTE: This feature works when typing text, as in a typewriter. It may
give unexpected results when performing other functions.</P>
<H4 ID="S3.6.3.6">Keyclick <SPAN CLASS="notoc">(Switch 2-2: 0 = Off, 1 = On)</SPAN></H4>
<P>Keyclick is the sound generated
each time you press a key, except for <SPAN CLASS="keyname">SHIFT</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="keyname">CTRL</SPAN>. Keyclick
can turn on or off; however, operators usually prefer this feature on.
Keyclick volume is not adjustable.</P>
<P>Keyclicks do not sound during a keyboard locked condition (indicated by
KBD LOCKED). See <A HREF="chapter1.html">Chapter 1</A> for more information about KBD LOCKED.</P>
<H4 ID="S3.6.3.7">ANSI/VT52 <SPAN CLASS="notoc">(Switch 2-3: 0 = VT52, 1 = ANSI)</SPAN></H4>
<P>The terminal follows
two different standards for processing control functions, American
National Standards Institute (ANSI) and VT52 compatible. With ANSI, the
terminal generates and responds to control functions per ANSI standards
X3.41-1974 and X3.64-1979. With VT52 compatible, the terminal can operate
with previous DIGITAL software using the VT52 video terminal. See
<A HREF="chapter5.html">Chapter 5</A> for more information about received characters and control
functions.</P>
<H4 ID="S3.6.3.8">Auto XON/XOFF (FDX) <SPAN CLASS="notoc">(Switch 2-4: 0 = Off, 1 = On)</SPAN></H4>
<P>The terminal
places received characters (other than NUL) in an input character buffer.
The input buffer holds received characters until the terminal processes
them. After processing, the terminal sends the characters to the computer,
printer, or screen.</P>
<P>If the terminal receives characters faster than it can process them, the
input character buffer begins to fill. Also, entering SET-UP prevents the
terminal from taking characters from the input buffer; this fills the input buffer
and may cause the loss of characters. When the buffer is full, the terminal
loses received characters and displays the substitute character
(<IMG SRC="char141.png" ALT="[]" HEIGHT="20" WIDTH="12">).</P>
<P>In full-duplex communication, the auto XON/XOFF feature prevents the
loss of received characters. When the feature is on, the terminal transmits
XON and XOFF to indicate that the input character buffer is almost full or
empty. When this buffer is almost full, the terminal transmits XOFF (DC3).
The computer should stop transmitting characters.</P>
<P>As the terminal processes (removes) characters from the input character
buffer, the number of characters in the buffer decreases. When the input
buffer is almost empty, the terminal transmits XON (DC1) to allow the
computer to continue transmitting characters.</P>
<P>When this feature is off, the terminal ignores XON and XOFF when received.
<SPAN CLASS="keyname">NO SCROLL</SPAN> (which uses XON and XOFF) does not function.</P>
<P CLASS="note">NOTE: The printer interface uses XON and XOFF regardless of the auto
XON/XOFF selection.</P>
<P>When this feature is on, XON and XOFF control the keyboard character
buffer. After receiving XOFF, the terminal stops transmitting characters to
the computer. After receiving XON the terminal can transmit characters to
the computer.</P>
<H4 ID="S3.6.3.9">US/UK Character Set <SPAN CLASS="notoc">(Switch 3-1: 0 = #, 1 = £)</SPAN></H4>
<P>This feature selects
either the United States or United Kingdom character set. The difference
between the two character sets is one character, the US # (number) or
UK £ (pound) symbol.</P>
<H4 ID="S3.6.3.10">Auto Wrap <SPAN CLASS="notoc">(Switch 3-2: 0 = Off, 1 = On)</SPAN></H4>
<P>This feature selects where
the next received character will appear when the cursor is at the right
margin. When the feature is off, the terminal writes the character and all
following characters into the last column of the current line. When the feature
is on, the terminal automatically displays the character on the next
line.</P>
<H4 ID="S3.6.3.11">Linefeed/New Line <SPAN CLASS="notoc">(Switch 3-3: 0 = Off, 1 = On)</SPAN></H4>
<P>This feature selects
the character(s) transmitted by <SPAN CLASS="keyname">RETURN</SPAN> and determines the action
taken by the terminal when receiving a linefeed.</P>
<P>When the feature is off, pressing <SPAN CLASS="keyname">RETURN</SPAN> generates a carriage return
(CR). A linefeed (LF) moves the cursor to the next line, maintaining the
current column position.</P>
<P>When the feature is on, pressing <SPAN CLASS="keyname">RETURN</SPAN> generates a carriage return
(CR) and linefeed (LF). A linefeed (LF) moves the cursor to the left margin
of the next line.</P>
<P CLASS="note">NOTE: The terminal processes form feed (FF) and vertical tab (VT) as
linefeed (LF).</P>
<H4 ID="S3.6.3.12">Local Echo <SPAN CLASS="notoc">(Switch 3-4: 0 = Off, 1 = On)</SPAN></H4>
<P>When this feature is on,
every character transmitted to the computer automatically appears on the
screen (<A HREF="figure3-10.html">Figure 3-10</A>). The computer does not have to transmit (echo) the
character back to the terminal for display. When the feature is off, the terminal
transmits characters only to the computer. The computer must
transmit them back to the terminal for display.</P>
<H4 ID="S3.6.3.13">Print Termination Character <SPAN CLASS="notoc">(Switch 4-1: 0 = None, 1 = Form Feed)</SPAN></H4>
<P>When this feature is set to form feed, the terminal transmits a form feed
(FF) to the printer after a print screen operation. When the feature is set
to none, the terminal does not transmit the print termination character.
However, carriage return (CR) and linefeed (LF) are always transmitted
when printing ends.</P>
<H4 ID="S3.6.3.14">Print Extent <SPAN CLASS="notoc">(Switch 4-2: 0 = S Reg, 1 = F Screen)</SPAN></H4>
<P>This feature selects
the characters printed during a print screen operation. When the
feature is set for full screen (F Screen), all characters on the screen print.
When the feature is set for scrolling region (S Reg), only the characters
located in the scrolling region print. The scrolling region is the screen
area between the top and bottom margins. The computer selects the margins.
If margins are not selected, all characters on the screen print.</P>
<H4 ID="S3.6.3.15">One or Two Stop Bits <SPAN CLASS="notoc">(Switch 4-3: 0 = one, 1 = two)</SPAN></H4>
<P>This feature
selects the number of stop bits (one or two) used by the modem interface.
The number of stop bits used by the computer and terminal must be the
same. See <A HREF="chapter6.html#S6.2.2">Modem Serial Characters</A> in <A HREF="chapter6.html">Chapter 6</A> for more information
about asynchronous character format and the use of stop bits.</P>
<P CLASS="note">NOTE: This feature does not select the number of stop bits used by the
printer interface. The printer transmit/receive speed SET-UP feature
does.</P>
<H4 ID="S3.6.3.16">Receive Parity <SPAN CLASS="notoc">(Switch 4-4: 0 = Ignore, 1 = Check)</SPAN></H4>
<P>This feature either
checks or ignores the parity bit of received characters. If the feature
is set to check, the terminal checks the parity bit selected by the parity
feature.</P>
<P CLASS="note">NOTE: The terminal can check received characters for odd or even parity,
but not for mark and space parity.</P>
<P>If a receive parity error occurs, the terminal displays the substitution character
(<IMG SRC="char141.png" ALT="[]" HEIGHT="20" WIDTH="12">) in place of the character with the error. When the feature is set
to ignore, the terminal ignores any parity bit received.</P>
<H4 ID="S3.6.3.17">Break Enable <SPAN CLASS="notoc">(Switch 5-1: 0 = Off, 1 = On)</SPAN></H4>
<P>When this feature is on,
pressing <SPAN CLASS="keyname">BREAK</SPAN> transmits a break. When this feature is off, <SPAN CLASS="keyname">BREAK</SPAN> does
not operate when pressed alone. All other key sequences using <SPAN CLASS="keyname">BREAK</SPAN>
are not affected. See <A HREF="chapter6.html#S6.2.3">Break</A> in <A HREF="chapter6.html">Chapter 6</A> for more information.</P>
<H4 ID="S3.6.3.18">Disconnect Character Enable <SPAN CLASS="notoc">(Switch 5-2: 0 = Off, 1 = On)</SPAN></H4>
<P>When
this feature is on, the terminal disconnects from the communication line
after receiving a disconnect character. The terminal also automatically
transmits a disconnect character after a long break disconnect. When the
feature is off, received control characters do not cause communication
line disconnects.</P>
<P>The turnaround/disconnect feature selects the disconnect character.
See <A HREF="#S3.6.3.33">Turnaround/Disconnect Character</A> for more information about turnaround
characters.</P>
<H4 ID="S3.6.3.19">Disconnect Delay (FDX) <SPAN CLASS="notoc">(Switch 5-3: 0 = UK, 1 = Other)</SPAN></H4>
<P>This feature
is only used when the modem control feature is set to full-duplex with
modem control (FDX B and FDX C). In these modes, the terminal disconnects
from the communication line after receive line signal detection
(RLSD) turns off. This feature selects the time period between loss of signal
and disconnection.</P>
<P>In the United Kingdom, the telephone system transmits a dial tone 0.06
seconds after RLSD is lost. For most other installations, the system transmits
a dial tone after 2 seconds.</P>
<P CLASS="note">NOTE: In the United States, always set this feature for other (1).</P>
<H4 ID="S3.6.3.20">Auto Answerback Enable <SPAN CLASS="notoc">(Switch 5-4: 0 = Off, 1 = On)</SPAN></H4>
<P>This feature
causes the terminal to automatically transmit the answerback message
after a communication line connection. In half-duplex communication with
the initial direction feature set to receive, the terminal cannot transmit the
answerback message until the line turns around. This feature does not affect
the transmission of the answerback message when using <SPAN CLASS="keyname">CTRL</SPAN> and
<SPAN CLASS="keyname">BREAK</SPAN>. See <A HREF="#S3.6.3.36">Answerback</A> in this chapter for more information.</P>
<H4 ID="S3.6.3.21">Initial Direction (HDX) <SPAN CLASS="notoc">(Switch 6-1: 0 = RCV, 1 = XMIT)</SPAN></H4>
<P>This feature
is only used when the modem control feature is set to half-duplex (HDX A
or HDX B). The feature determines if the terminal begins half-duplex communication
by receiving (RCV) or transmitting (XMIT).</P>
<H4 ID="S3.6.3.22">Auto Turnaround (HDX) <SPAN CLASS="notoc">(Switch 6-2: 0 = Manual, 1 = Auto)</SPAN></H4>
<P>This feature
is only used when the modem control feature is set to half-duplex
coded control (HDX B). The feature causes the terminal to automatically
transmit the turnaround character (selected by the turnaround/disconnect
character feature) after:</P>
<UL>
<LI>The characters transmitted by <SPAN CLASS="keyname">RETURN</SPAN></LI>
<LI>The end of the answerback message.</LI>
</UL>
<P CLASS="note">NOTE: If the turnaround character is carriage return (CR), <SPAN CLASS="keyname">RETURN</SPAN> does
not generate two carriage returns.</P>
<P>When this feature is set for manual, you must use a <SPAN CLASS="keyname">CTRL</SPAN> key combination
to generate the turnaround character. See <A HREF="chapter4.html">Chapter 4</A> when using
<SPAN CLASS="keyname">CTRL</SPAN> to generate control characters.</P>

<H4 ID="S3.6.3.29">Modem Data/Parity Bits</H4>
<P>This feature selects two separate but related
communication features, data bits per character and parity. You can set
data bits per character to seven or eight data bits. When you select eight bits,
the terminal sets the eighth data bit to a space (or 0) for transmitted characters
and ignores the eighth bit of received characters.</P>
<P>Parity selects the type of parity bit the terminal generates when transmitting
or receiving characters. To check the parity of received characters,
set the receive parity feature to check. When you use received parity,
set the parity feature to odd or even. The terminal cannot check mark
and space parity.</P>
<P>If you select no parity, the terminal omits the parity bit in transmitted characters

<H4 ID="S3.6.3.35">Printer Transmit/Receive Speed</H4>
<P>This feature selects the terminal
speed (baud rate) for transmitting and receiving characters from the printer.
The receive and transmit speeds of the printer interface are always the
same (different receive and transmit speeds are not provided). Set feature
to match the printer transmit and receive speeds. The printer interface
uses one of the following receive/transmit speeds: 50, 75, 110,
134.5, 150, 200, 300, 600, 1200, 1800, 2000, 2400, 3600, 4800, 9600,
and 19,200 baud. The printer interface uses one stop bit per character for
speeds greater than 110, and two stop bits per character for 110 or less.
Select the printer interface receive/transmit speeds by using the following
procedure.</P>

<P>This feature lets you store a 20-character identifying message
that the terminal transmits to the computer under the following conditions.</P>
<UL>
<LI>The computer transmits a direct request for identification. The computer
transmits enquire (ENQ) and the terminal responds with the answerback
message. The entire sequence takes place automatically,
without affecting the screen or needing operator action.</LI>
<LI>You transmit the answerback message from the keyboard. Hold
down <SPAN CLASS="keyname">CTRL</SPAN> and press <SPAN CLASS="keyname">BREAK</SPAN> to transmit the answerback message.</LI>
<LI>You set the auto answerback enable feature, and the terminal connects
to the communication line. In half-duplex, the terminal transmits
the answerback message when first allowed to transmit.</LI>
