I hoped you would say that. Single setopts are much better to read.

Anything special? Is that described somewhere?

I cannot find it in 'Standard Widgets'.

This is probably some trivial stuff I just happened to avoid before: I
have some bindkeys in my /etc/zshenv, and I want to understand what
they are doing. So I would simply need a list that translates "^[[23~"
or "^[6;5~" in whatever key is meant.

Thanks for your help!
