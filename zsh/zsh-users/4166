Yes, it can tell that it's in $(...) or `...`.  It doesn't complete the
trailing backtick or closing paren because there's no way to tell when
you're really at the end of the expression.  How is it supposed to know
whether you mean
    `cat /var/run/inetd.pid` 
or whether you're going to go on with more of the command, as in
    `cat /var/run/inetd.pid /var/run/sshd.pid`
or the like?
