Network Shell (a commercial product: www.shpink.com) takes this a few
steps further. I'm not sure if they've compiled zsh with their
distributed i/o libs yet, but I could ask if people are interested.

   Peace,

disclaimer: I know the founder of the company and have given them
porting access to a machine at our site because it seemed like a cool
product (but we have no specific commercial relationship with them).
