After which it can be bound via:

bindkey "\033[50~" widget-name

Just emphasizing that there's still no equivalency of any sort with 
Ctrl-;

\033[50~ is sort of like the sequence an <F36> key might produce:

F1=\e[11~, F2=\e[12~, F3=\e[13~, ...
(skips after F5, F10, F14, F16),
F18=\e[32~, F19=\e[33~, F20=\e[34~, ...

(I assume '50' was picked for being unlikely to conflict.)
