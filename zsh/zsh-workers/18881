The bash completion does not use the content of 'svn help'
AFAIK. (we're talking about the script in tools/client-side/ right?).

I wanted to work on a more powerful completion, but I was spending
most of my time learning to code in bash :)  I've not totally given
up, just trying to create some time to work on that ...

I had not thought of using svn help output to feed the completion
though, that sounds quite a neat idea. Are you willing to work on it
(you seemed to use zsh rather than bash though) ? Or do you know
existing examples of such bash scripts that could be a basis for an
svn one ?
