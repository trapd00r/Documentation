If you look at the 3.0.x documentation (where there aren't any modules)
you'll see that it used to be like that.  The builtins that were moved
to modules had their doc moved to each module's doc approximately at the
same time the code was broken out.

I don't disagree, but don't you ever look in the index?

It's been a very long time since the first thing I did after bringing
up the zsh info was not to hit `i' and enter the keyword I want.  (That's=

why I finally got annoyed enough to add the styles and tags to an index.)=

Yes.

No, I disagree.  The new completion system and completion widgets are
both introduced in the compctl section, and it's a better simple intro
to completion than either of the others.  At least until we get a more
substantial rewrite, I think it should stay where it is.

On the other hand, having the word "Programmable" in the title of only
the compctl section is a bit misleading.  This patch drops that word.

It's too bad texinfo doesn't deal better with more deeply-nested section
hierarchy.
