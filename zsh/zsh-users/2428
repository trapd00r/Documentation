Ouch, that's because they didn't get added to .distfiles so didn't appear
in the distribution.  I've put them in for next time.

For now you can get the missing manuals from

http://www.ifh.de/~pws/computing/zshcompsys.1
http://www.ifh.de/~pws/computing/zshcompwid.1
http://www.ifh.de/~pws/computing/zshzftpsys.1

or the files Doc/Zsh/compsys.yo, Doc/Zsh/compwid.yo and Doc/Zsh/zftpsys.yo
are fairly readable in their raw forms.
