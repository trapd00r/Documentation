It's a bit hard to follow getkeystring() in the multibyte branches,
but as that should always be allocating more rather than less space,
I believe the answer is "that's correct".  Minimum it's \45 -> %%.

In that case, no need to touch builtin.c at all.

For one thing, hasn't austin-group been discussing \Cx where zsh at
present uses the old Emacs syntax of \C-x ?
