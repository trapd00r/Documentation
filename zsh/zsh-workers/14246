} I normally use a sigle space, but that still results in a `-X desc'
} option passed to the action.

Yes, which results in things like

    No match for ` ', `file', or `directory'

} If you don't want that, we could probably special-case that single space
} to mean to not pass a -X.

Either that, or strip all leading/trailing whitespace from the message,
and ignore empty messages.
