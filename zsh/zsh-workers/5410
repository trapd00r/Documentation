Oh please help somebody.

pws-8 ran just fine on  IRIX 6.2

Yesterday I upgraded to IRIX 6.5.2 .

Now the old(i.e. compiled under 6.2) zsh (version pws-8)  binary
got a bus error on the new system.

Then I tried to recompile.

Generating a STATIC version WITHOUT --enable-zsh-mem seems to run fine.

Generating a STATIC version WITH --enable-zsh-mem gives a bus error.

Generating a DYNAMIC version WITHOUT --enable-zsh-mem and  optimization -O
  seems to run.

Generating a DYNAMIC version WITHOUT --enable-zsh-mem and FULL optimization
   (-O3 -OPT:Olimit=0) gives a segment fault.


Any ideas?  (Oh well, SGI is well known for its buggy compilers. But this
time they must have introduced a new one. One -O3 bug in version 7.2
has definitely gone in the current 7.2.1 version. But this here is new)

Thanks for sharing your insight,
Helmut.
