Yes, that looks right.

Only thing is that the descriptions passed to _alternative should be
in the singular form - "signal" and "file" instead of "signals" and
"files". That's our convention: you're only completing one file (though
more than one may match and the next argument may also be a file). The
"name" description for the final files should probably also be "file".
I'm not posting another patch for that though. I suggest you just commit
it.
