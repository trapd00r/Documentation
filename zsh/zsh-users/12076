Are you saying all completion fails with "mount -c /" and "setopt nocaseglob"
regardless of anything else?  I can't get this to happen.  Is it specific
to this case, or does the usual "mount -c /cygdrive" show it too?  Is it
specific to absolute paths?  (In short, I'm likely to need a lot more
help.)
