`perl -M<TAB>' works for me.  Have you a more specific example?

Are you sure you're getting the most recent _perl_modules?  _wanted is
called at the end and now takes a command to execute as an argument, so
it looks to me as though you've got an updated _wanted but an older
_perl_modules.

I've no idea what would be happening there, but if _perl_modules is out
of date then so may other things be ...
