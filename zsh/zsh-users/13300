There certainly is:  completion for these files is in
Completion/Unix/Command/_init_d which asks to be called as

#compdef -p */(init|rc[0-9S]#).d/*

in other words *any* completion from *anywhere* involving files in an init
and an rc directory tries to treat it as if it was a service to be started
or stopped.  It seems hard to believe this is the right thing to do.

That's because the file is coming from stdin, so it doesn't see the file
name and can't tell it's a .html file.  It's a necessary feature of the way
READNULLCMD works that it does read from stdin, so that can't really be
changed.  However, there may be a workaround.
