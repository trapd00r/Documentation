They were chosen because they warn about most undesirable constructs.
In order to use a non-GCC compiler, just export the environment variable
CC in the environment of configure.  For example,

CC=cc ./configure

will use cc as the compiler, and "-O" as CFLAGS (which you can override
in the same way).

Question to developers: why was the (void) added?  It seems to have been
fine with just ().
