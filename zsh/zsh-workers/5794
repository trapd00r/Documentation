I have a feeling, that these two are related ...

Look at this (zsh-3.1.5-pws-12):

bor@itsrm2:~%> for i in 1 2 3 4
for> do
for><up-line-or-history>
   gives
bor@itsrm2:~%> for i in 1 2 3 4
for> do
for> setopt completeinword

That is, when working with multiline input _every_ line is considered the
"first and only" line of input by ZLE.

I find it (and always found) very confusing. Even more, as you can go to
previous line by using backward-char

It is confusing, because when I recall the whole buffer, I *can* use
up-line-or-history as expected.

And it is related to multiline paste because if we treated the input as
multiline, there would probably be no need to call trashzle at all ...
