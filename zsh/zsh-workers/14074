We will very likely be branching to produce 4.1 (if we can find some excuse
--- probably improved parameter code).  I was hoping to delay that as late
as possible to avoid any immediate fallout from 4.0.1 having to be applied
twice.  But if the termcap stuff gets re-applied soon, and can't be
resolved, we may be back where you suggest.  I would hope it wouldn't be
important enough to hold off until a separate development branch.

It's easy --- probably easier --- to branch after the release if necessary,
so I don't think this is a big worry.

You mean a PM_ flag that doesn't get stored with parameters, just used when
substituting?  It could certainly be useful.
