This is rather minor, but I happened to notice.

_values always adds a suffix `:' when it's dealing with colon-separated
arrays.  This is actually pretty annoying if the elements of the array are
paths, when you'd prefer to have the usual `/' and add a `:' by hand where
necessary.  How about only adding the `:' if the element doesn't already
contain a `/' or initial `~'?  Or suppose I get in the habit of using
`typeset -T' and adding things to real arrays?  Maybe the second
alternative is better.
