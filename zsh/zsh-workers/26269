} Inline stuff can be affected by line breaks and other crap, though.

If that hasn't been a problem for the previous more than ten years,
why it is going to suddenly become a problem now?

Please don't do that; it both exposes the MIME structure in the mailing

If you simply must use attachments, just label them text/plain, unless
they're so huge you've compressed them or some such, of course.
