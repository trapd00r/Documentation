Hi,

I just fetched and tested zsh-4.0.2 (Linux) and noticed a discrepancy during
'make check'. I also found that the same discrepancy was already present for
zsh-4.0.1. Here my output:

../../zsh-4.0.2/Test/Y03arguments.ztst: starting.
*** /tmp/zsh.ztst.out.7683	Tue Jul  3 13:50:57 2001

Test ../../zsh-4.0.2/Test/Y03arguments.ztst failed: output differs from expected as shown above for:
 tst_arguments ':desc1:(a b)'
 comptest $'tst \t'
Was testing: a and b
../../zsh-4.0.2/Test/Y03arguments.ztst: test failed.
make[1]: [check] Error 1 (ignored)
rm -rf Modules .zcompdump

All other test have succeeded.
