Hi,

For several weeks now, I've been hacking/modifying/updating the texinfo
source (zsh.texi) to reflect the changes made since it was last updated
(about 25 years ago ;-), and now have it finished.  

Anyway, to cut a long story short, the diff is larger than the new
file so it would be pretty stupid mailing that. 

The updated zsh.texi is 65k gzip'd.
Am I going to get flamed for posting it to the list - should I just mail
it to Zoltan ?????

Clive.
