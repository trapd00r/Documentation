Yes. 8639 includes 8633.

I reverted 8633 before applying 8639.

Since My script checks a patch by `patch --dry-run --force -p0' before
apprying the patch, it detected that 8639 has some problems.  Then, I
checked 8639, I found out that it includes changes in 8633 and my
local files patched by 8633 caused a problm.  So, I reverted 8633 by
`patch -R' and restarted my script.  I.e. finally I ignored 8633 at
all.  So my compsys.yo had no dubled paragraphs.
