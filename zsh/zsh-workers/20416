I'm curious what people think about that new version of _make that
avoids using perl and awk.  Here's a link to that message:

http://www.zsh.org/mla/workers/2004/msg00926.html

Should we go this route?  Maybe someone has some really large Makefiles
that could be used for some speed comparisons?

Also, we'd need to figure out if it is handling non-gnu include files
properly (there is probably still a little more work to do there).

If we don't want to go this route, I'd like to see the existing perl/awk
code enhanced to do variable expansion and include-file following.
