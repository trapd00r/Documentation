I see.  Is there a simple way to achieve the behavior you describe
above?

I asked the same question on the gentoo-user mailing list, and one
person gave the following suggestion:

###############################################
rehashComplete() {
    rehash;
    zle expand-or-complete;
}

zle -N rehash-complete rehashComplete
bindkey "\t" rehash-complete
###############################################

That works (meaning, it makes the shell behave as I want), but I was
just hoping there was a simpler method, i.e. "setopt something".

Anyway, thanks for the helpful information!
Matt
