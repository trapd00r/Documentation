The function I sent needs to be inside a special file in your function
path, given by the $fpath variable.  If you don't have such a directory,
create one, for example "mkdir ~/zsh-function".  Then  in your .zshrc
(at some point before "compinit" is run) put

fpath=(~/zsh-functions $fpath)

Then put the contents of the function in a file _cm in that directory.
You should be able to do:

% cat ~/zsh-functions/_cm
#compdef cm ex
... rest of file ...

Then the next time you start the shell completion for "cm" and "ex" will
work.
