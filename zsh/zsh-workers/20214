More investigation reveals a further problem.  There's an arbitrary
debugging check when unreferencing the function that it hasn't been
referenced more than 256 times.  This needs to be the function depth if
that is defined plus 1 (to allow for the original function struture).
I've added a few on for fuzz.  Presumably the test is meaningless if
there is no function depth limit.

If you try this with a the default function depth limit, it's
interesting to note that the error message is printed almost straight
away, while the prompt takes a while to return.  I wonder if freeing
things up is slower than necessary?
