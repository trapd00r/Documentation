This could be done without much difficulty by simplifying zftp_open and
wiring the code into the existing redirection stuff.  Unfortunately no-one
else apart from Zefram has shown much interest in the network stuff, so
it's unlikely to happen any time soon.

You could probably then rewrite most if not all of zftp as shell functions.
