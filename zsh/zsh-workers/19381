Subject: PATCH: zmv warning

I tried to rename a file to lower case using zmv and it told me the file
already existed.  Eventually I realised this was because the file system
was a Samba partition and the two referred to the same file.  It's a
real error in that the final mv command gives the same error, but it
could do with a better message.

Actually, it should be possible to do this via an intermediate file,
since Samba does show you the file in the canonical form even though it
recognises it with case changes.  However, that's too hard for now.

This was entirely on Unix but I imagine similar things happen with
Cygwin.  (Yes, I would prefer to use NFS.)
