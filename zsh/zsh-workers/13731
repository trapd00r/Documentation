Something like this.  I don't know if it's going to be a problem with it
always taking precedence, however; one of these simple ones can then mask
any of the other sort if you just type a fairly generic prefix.  But maybe
it works OK in practice.  If they used different tags, you could used
`_next_tags' to get round this.  (Does anyone else use _next_tags?)
