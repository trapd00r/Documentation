Hi,
any script executed by cron is executed by the Bourne shell (on my machine,
I don't try to replace /bin/sh by zsh)

Is there any trick to use zsh?
Unfortunately

#!/bin/zsh
is not recognized when a script is executed by /bin/sh.

The only work around for me is

exec /bin/zsh << 'EOF'
....

But then
- there is an additional exec 
- the parameters to the script are lost


Is there any magic available?

Thanks for any hints,
Helmut Jarausch.
