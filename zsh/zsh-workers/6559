I don't think remaking is a big issue, but I've always thought it was silly
to have manual pages attempt to reflect local install paths.  There's always
somebody who shuffles things around after the fact or tries to share manual
pages over NFS (or over the web!), rendering compile-time patching useless.

Yes, that works.

} This complicates installation,
} however, and Oliver was suggesting he'd prefer the directory structure
} retained.  I haven't worked out a simple way of doing all this.

Just a random thought ... the installation process has just copied a zsh
binary into place, right?  So you can write a zsh function to install the
rest of the zsh functions, and feed it to the zsh that you just built ...

(Except that doesn't work when cross-compiling, sigh.)
