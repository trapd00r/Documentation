I will spend time this weekend checking the texi against the man pages,

Bart: Please point your browser at:

	http://cust-www.easynet.co.uk/~epos/zsh_toc.html

where you will find the latest working copy. Please mail any 
errors/differences with it and the man-pages to _me_, rather than the
whole list, unless the error is also in the man page.
