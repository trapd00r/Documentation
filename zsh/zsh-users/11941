Hmmmmmm.  This caused a scrolling read-out to the terminal of everything
but the kitchen sink and went on for about 3 minutes.  I don't know that
it hung, but after it finished, every time I pressed <RETURN> I got this
(it stopped when I removed "set -x" from my .zshrc) :

[panix1:~]  [v4.3.4]  zsh  1001 -->

[panix1:~]  [v4.3.4]  zsh  1001 -->

I have no idea what it means except that "psvar"
is "prmptstring variable."
