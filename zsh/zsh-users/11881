I got the following to work.

In terminal A:

  % typeset REPLY
  % zmodload zsh/net/socket
  % zsocket -l /tmp/zsocket
  % print $REPLY
  11
  % zsocket -a 11

This now blocks.  (I put the "typeset REPLY" at the start to ensure REPLY is
created as a string, as you would naturally do in a function.)

In terminal B:

  % typeset REPLY
  % zmodload zsh/net/socket
  % zsocket /tmp/zsocket
  % print $REPLY
  3

Terminal A returns at this point and I did:

  % print $REPLY
  3
  % read -u3 && print $REPLY

and in terminal B:

  % print -u3 This is a message on the socket

which produces in terminal A:

  This is a message on the socket

As far as I can see there's no way of closing the file descriptors using
zsocket, which seems an omission.  Presumably you can use "exec 3>&-"
etc. although to close a file descriptor over 9 you need to do something
like:

  % fd=11
  % exec {fd}>&-
