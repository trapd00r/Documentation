Hi,

I'm trying to get 'relative filename completion' to work - i.e. a
filename completion which doesnt work relative to '.', but relative to
some other Directory. ("compctl -g '~/Mail/*(:t)' mutt" is not able to
complete in subdirs). So far i tried various things, and the closest i
could come up with was:
compctl -g '~/Mail/**/*(:s_/home/sec/Mail/__)' mutt
but that still doesnt do "the right thing"[tm] (it shows all files in
subdirectorys also if you list the choices) - so i wonder if i missed
some point in the manual - and if not, i'd make this a "Feature request"
as i need this feature quite often.

CU,
    Sec

P.S.: i'm using zsh-3.0.1
