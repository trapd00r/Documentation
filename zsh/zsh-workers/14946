Here's what I think the 4.0.1 --> 4.0.2 ChangeLog diff should look like
based on patches so far (including a few on the dev trunk that have not
be committed to the branch yet).  This has been synchronized with the
trunk ChangeLog to make it easier to see what's different in the latest
dev version; that means the entries reflect the dates that changes were
made to the dev code, not necessarily the dates they were committed to
the branch -- I think that makes sense, as we have the CVS logs to tell
us the latter.

I have a patched-up branch sandbox from which I can commit all the bits
mentioned below that have not yet been committed, if PWS and Sven agree
that this looks right.  (Note this diff can't be patched onto the branch
ChangeLog, it has to be patched onto the 4.0.1 release ChangeLog.)

+2001-06-14  Peter Stephenson  <pws@csr.com>
+
+	* 14921: Completion/Zsh/_zftp: autoload zfcd_match and zfget_match
+	if necessary.
+
+2001-06-13  Sven Wischnowsky  <wischnow@zsh.org>
+
+	* 14903: Src/Zle/complist.c, Src/Zle/zle_tricky.c: fixes for
+	display bugs for completion lists (cursor left one line to far
+	up or down)
+
+2001-06-13  Peter Stephenson  <pws@csr.com>
+
+	* 14893: Src/signals.c: make handler mod_export because it's
+	needed for signal queueing in various modules.  Probably
+	sensible to change handler to zhandler too --- not done yet.
+
+2001-06-13  Sven Wischnowsky  <wischnow@zsh.org>
+
+	* 14897 (and Oliver Kiddle: 14862): Completion/Base/Utility/_values,
+	Completion/Unix/Command/_mount, Completion/Unix/Type/_dir_list,
+	Src/Zle/computil.c: fix for comparguments (completing after
+	single letter options that get their argument in the next
+	word); make _values ignore some of the standard option it may
+	get; make _mount use _dir_list in some places and improve that;
+	`document' comparguments and compvalues with some comments in
+	computil.c
+
+2001-06-13  Oliver Kiddle  <opk@zsh.org>
+
+	* 14896: Completion/Zsh/Type/_command_names: don't complete read-only
+	parameters on the left side of an assignment
+
+2001-06-13  Peter Stephenson  <pws@csr.com>
+
+	* unposted: Completion/compinstall: spotted by Bart: assignments
+	when finding $fpath if not set in current shell were completely
+	garbled.
+
+2001-06-13  Sven Wischnowsky  <wischnow@zsh.org>
+
+	* 14883 (Jos Backus): Completion/Unix/Command/_mount: add code for
+	BSDish systems
+
+2001-06-12  Bart Schaefer  <schaefer@zsh.org>
+
+	* 14849: README: Request "reporter" output only if a bug cannot
+	be reproduced with 'zsh -f'.
+
+2001-06-11  Sven Wischnowsky  <wischnow@zsh.org>
+
+	* 14841: Completion/Base/Utility/_values, Src/Zle/computil.c:
+	new word parsing for compvalues; this should now handle empty
+	separators correctly, as far as it is possible
+
+2001-06-11  Peter Stephenson  <pws@csr.com>
+
+	* 14840: Doc/Zsh/options.yo: document search behaviour with
+	PATH_DIRS option.
+
+2001-06-10  Clint Adams  <clint@zsh.org>
+
+	* 14830: config.guess, config.sub:
+	upgrade to GNU's June 5 and 8 versions,
+	respectively.
+
+2001-06-09  Bart Schaefer  <schaefer@zsh.org>
+
+	* unposted (see 14826): Test/C02cond.ztst: Force group of new
+	directory created for file-mode tests to be owned by the current
+	effective group.
+
+	* 14824: Test/comptest: Avoid echotc (improvement on 14792).
+
+2001-06-08  Bart Schaefer  <schaefer@zsh.org>
+
+	* 14796: zshconfig.ac: More reliable BROKEN_KILL_ESRCH test.
+
+2001-06-07  Bart Schaefer  <schaefer@zsh.org>
+
+	* 14792: Test/comptest: Don't import the current terminal type for
+	the zpty terminal, because the current terminal might not be able
+	to run ZLE (e.g., emacs shell mode).
+
+	* 14712: Doc/Zsh/builtins.yo: Improve appearance of long hanging
+	paragraph tag for the "read" builtin.
+
+	* 14578: Src/Modules/termcap.c: Handle vagaries of tgetflag()
+	return value in new function ztgetflag().
+
+2001-06-07  Wayne Davison  <wayned@users.sourceforge.net>
+
+	* 14793: Src/hist.c: Don't mark a HIST_TMPSTORE entry with HIST_OLD
+	so that the HFILE_FAST algorithm in savehistfile() will recheck this
+	histnum later.
+
+2001-06-06  Andrej Borsenkow  <bor@zsh.org>
+
+	* 14772: David Lebel <lebel@lebel.org>: zshconfig.ac: patch
+	for dynamic linking on OpenBSD
+
+	* 14766: Src/prompt.c: uniform %l substitution
+

+	.distfiles, Makefile.in, configure.in, Src/mkmakemod.sh: Allow
+	processing by both autoconf-2.13 and autoconf-2.50; remove
+	config.status hack for autoconf-2.50
+
+2001-06-06  Sven Wischnowsky  <wischnow@zsh.org>
+
+	* 14736: Doc/Zsh/compsys.yo: make docs for _wanted and
+	_requested clearer (command has to allow options passed to it)
+
+	* 14733: Completion/Base/Utility/_arguments: two fixes: try all
+	actions that have to be tried (but only once), execute actions
+	if we aren't after an option already (in the same word)
+
+2001-06-05  Chmouel Boudjnah  <chmouel@mandrakesoft.com>
+
+	* 14550: Completion/Redhat/Command/_rpm: Add --nobuild and --nogpg
+	to rpm completion
+
 2001-06-01  Peter Stephenson  <pws@csr.com>
 
 	* Config/version.mk: 4.0.1 released, finally.
