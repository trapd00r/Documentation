:Below is a fix.  The second expansion might still look a bit weird:
:% echo 1${^a}1${^^x}
:1a1x 1ay 1b1x 1by
:
:The logic is that the string after the rc-param, 1${^^x}, is expanded,

I don't get this,  shouldn't 1${^^x} produce one string "1x y"?  And then the
expansion of 1${^a}1${^^x} be the string "1a1x y 1b1x y"?  Your logic 
indicates to me that it's producing array like thingies.  Is this dependant
on some other wierd option?  Please explain before I go mental.
