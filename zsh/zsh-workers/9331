Hi again!

I must say I was more than a bit impressed by the quick and handy response
to my message a few days ago (and thanks for the backwards-compatible hint
too ;-). A few days of reading the manual later, I thought I might
contribute at least an occasional tiny documentation fix, but it seems
rather proof-read indeed. Here's all I've found to date:

diff -c Doc/Zsh/compwid.yo Doc/Zsh/compwid.fix.yo=20

  matches, e.g.:

! example(complete-filles LPAR()RPAR() { compadd - * })
 =20
  This function will complete files in the current directory matching the=
=20
  current word.
