That's a problem with "transmission-remote". It expects a
regular file and <(cat) is a pipe (transmission-remote and cat
run concurrently). It's the same as:

ssh remotehost "cat | transmission-remote -a /dev/stdin" < ~/torrent.file

You could have done 

ssh remotehost "transmission-remote -a /dev/stdin" < ~/torrent.file

In which case it would probably have been a pipe as well.

$ ssh localhost lsof -ac lsof -d0

[...]

Here, zsh creates a temp file. cat and transmission-remote are
run sequencially (zsh waits for cat to finish fill up the temp
file and then runs transmission-remote with that temp file name
as argument), it's the same as

ssh remotehost "cat > tempfile; transmission -a tempfile" < ~/torrent.file
