It's possible to avoid this problem.  Change the compinit line wherever
it occurs in your start-up files to:

compinit -u -d ~/.zcompdump_$ZSH_VERSION

compinstall (if you use that to generate or tweak your settings) is
smart enough to keep this line.

The remaining problem is removing ancient versions of .zcompdump.
