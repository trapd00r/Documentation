Subject: Diff file for 3.1.6-test-3 available
Date: Sat, 24 Jul 1999 15:21:40 +0200
From: Peter Stephenson <pws@ibmth.df.unipi.it>

Since Bart is hoping to get 3.0.6 finalised fairly quickly, so we are
hoping to release both versions simultaneously, I've released
another test version of 3.1.6.  The diff is again in the testing
subdirectory on ftp.zsh.org, and should percolate to other servers.

-rw-r--r--  1 mason  zsh    58602 Jul 19 22:25 zsh-3.1.6-test-1-test-2.diff.gz
-rw-r--r--  1 mason  zsh  1251180 Jul 13 00:57 zsh-3.1.6-test-1.tar.gz
-rw-r--r--  1 mason  zsh   140452 Jul 24 23:47 zsh-3.1.6-test-2-test-3.diff.gz

You will need to apply both diff files to the test-1 release from the top
level directory in zsh-3.1.6-test-1:
  zcat /path/to/zsh-3.1.6-test-1-test-2-diff.gz | patch -p0
  zcat /path/to/zsh-3.1.6-test-2-test-3-diff.gz | patch -p0
  touch stamp-h.in

The largest change by volume this time is in the documentation, which is
why the patch is so big.  Other significant changes are again in the
completion code; some system-dependent configuration changes have been
made; a couple of small bugs have been fixed.
