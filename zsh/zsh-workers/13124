I forgot that this requires a change to nslookup.

Also, I committed a tweak to newptycmd() after sending the patch in 13123,
to unset `interactive' in the cloned shell before calling execode().  This
seems like the right thing to do; the clone itself isn't interactive any
more, even if the command it's eval'ing probably is, and it prevents the
saving of history or sourcing of .zlogout should an `exec' or `exit' be
performed in the clone.  (Patch for that not included here, it's in CVS.)
