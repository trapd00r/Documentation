Will the other NFS clients necessarily notice the inode change?

Anyway it seems that this solution would work. I did a test with
Emacs, which changes the inode when modifying a file, simulating
what zsh does by removing some .zhistory lines at the beginning,
and there was no problem with NFS.

Making it optional would be a good idea, much better than requiring
some mount options (which can slow down other applications...).
