Hiya.

I just got zsh 3.0.0 (I used to use zsh about 2 years ago & was
missing it in my new job...).

I spotted this in the info file, Node: Specifying Options:

--------cut-here--------8<--------cut-here--------8<--------cut-here--------
The sense of an option name may be inverted by preceding it with `no',
so `setopt No_Beep' is equivalent to `setopt beep'.
--------cut-here--------8<--------cut-here--------8<--------cut-here--------

It's lies!

Chris.
