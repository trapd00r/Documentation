I seem to have answered my own question.  I had some strange file in my
home directory called .zsomething-or-other that I can't even remember what
it was called.  In it, it had 'PS1='.  I blew it away, and my problem went
with it.  I don't know how that file got there or how long it was there.  I 
can do my su now, though.

John
