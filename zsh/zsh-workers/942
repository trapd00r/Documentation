Oh you dont have to reset TERM if you get TERMINFO into the environment before
starting a new shell, only if you want to change it in the current shell,
e.g. in .zshenv.  I forgot to add I think that I am back at 2.5b10, still
waiting for an official release before reinstalling.

Does pointing TERMINFO to the standard data base work? How about to one which
has a copy of the standard data base's xterm?
