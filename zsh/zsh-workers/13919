Aha!  So it's the question that's misleading.  When I'm asked:

    There are insecure directories, use them anyway [ny]? 

"Use *them* anyway" means, to me, "include the insecure directories among
those searched by the completion system for functions."  What the question
is actually asking is:

    Ignore insecure directories and continue [ny]?

So let's actually say that.
