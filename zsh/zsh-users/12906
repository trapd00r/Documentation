For example, you can not space out screen windows over terminal
emulator tabs. Also, you can not run a screen session across a reboot
which works just fine with a ID thing.

What would you neec X for? The TE sets the variable in the environment and
invokes the shell, which takes over from there.

I forwarded you the full thread. Is Alpine a proper replacement for pine, now?
I heard of pain when Alpine was born.

Re-attaching is outside the scope of this. One could think about using a
mechanism like retty or simply stopping the execution of the 'child',
pivoting STDIN, STDOUT and STDERR from under its feet and letting
it run again, but that confuses a _lot_ of programs (for the obvious reason
that this is something you normally do not anticipate).
