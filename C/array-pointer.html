	<h2>Introduction</h2>

	<p>I'm glad you asked. The answer is surprisingly simple: almost
		everything. In other words, they have almost nothing in common. To
		understand why, we'll take a look at what they are and what operations they
		support.</p>

	<h2>Arrays</h2>

	<p>An array is a fixed-length collection of objects, which are stored
		sequentially in memory. There are only three things you can do with an
		array:</p>

	<ol style='list-style-type:decimal'><li><code>sizeof</code> - <em>get its size</em><br>
		You can apply <code>sizeof</code> to it. An array x of N elements of type T
		(<code>T x[N]</code>) has the size <code>N * sizeof (T)</code>, which is what you
		should expect. For example, if <code>sizeof (int) == 2</code> and <code>int
		arr[5];</code>, then <code>sizeof arr == 10 == 5 * 2 == 5 * sizeof (int)</code>.</li><li><code>&amp;</code> - <em>get its address</em><br>
		You can take its address with <code>&amp;</code>, which results in a pointer to the entire array.</li><li>any other use - <em>implicit pointer conversion</em><br>
		Any other use of an array results in a pointer to the first array element (the array &quot;decays&quot; to a pointer).</li></ol>

	<p>That's all. Yes, this means arrays don't provide direct access to their
		contents. More specifically, there is no array indexing operator.</p>

	<h2>Pointers</h2>

	<p>A pointer is a value that refers to another object (or function). You
		might say it contains the object's address. Here are the operations
		that pointers support:</p>

	<ol style='list-style-type:decimal'><li><code>sizeof</code> - <em>get its size</em><br>
 		Like arrays, pointers have a size that can be obtained with
 		<code>sizeof</code>.  Note that different pointer types can have different
 		sizes.</li><li><code>&amp;</code> - <em>get its address</em><br>
 		Assuming your pointer is an lvalue, you can take its address with
 		<code>&amp;</code>. The result is a pointer to a pointer.</li><li><code>*</code> - <em>dereference it</em><br>
		Assuming the base type of your pointer isn't an incomplete type, you
		can dereference it; i.e., you can follow the pointer and get the object
		it refers to. Incomplete types include <code>void</code> and predeclared
		<code>struct</code> types that haven't been defined yet.</li><li><code>+</code>, <code>-</code> - <em>pointer arithmetic</em><br>
		If you have a pointer to an array element, you can add an integer
		amount to it. This amount can be negative, and <code>ptr - n</code> is
		equivalent to <code>ptr + -n</code> (and <code>-n + ptr</code>, since <code>+</code> is
		commutative, even with pointers). If <code>ptr</code> is a pointer to the
		<code>i</code>'th element of an array, then <code>ptr + n</code> is a pointer to
		the <code>(i + n)</code>'th array element, unless <code>i + n</code> is negative or
		greater than the number of array elements, in which case the results
		are undefined. If <code>i + n</code> is equal to the number of elements, the
		result is a pointer that must not be dereferenced.</li></ol>

	<p>That's it, really. However, there are a few other pointer operations defined in terms of the above fundamental operations:</p>

	<ol style='list-style-type:decimal'><li><code>-&gt;</code> - <em>struct dereference</em><br>
		<code>p-&gt;m</code> is equivalent to <code>(*p).m</code>, where <code>.</code> is the
		struct/union member access operator. This means <code>p</code> must be a
		pointer to a struct or union.</li><li><code>[]</code> - <em>indexed dereference</em><br>
		<code>a[b]</code> is equivalent to <code>*(a + b)</code>. This means
		<code>a</code> and <code>b</code> must be a pointer to an array element and
		an integer; not necessarily respectively, because <code>a[b] ==
		*(a + b) == *(b + a) == b[a]</code>. Another important equivalence is
		<code>p[0] == 0[p] == *p</code>.</li></ol>

	<h2>A quirk of parameter declarations</h2>

	<p>However, there's one thing that confuses this issue. Whenever you
		declare a function parameter to have an array type, it gets silently
		converted to a pointer and any size information is ignored. Thus the
		following four declarations are equivalent:</p>

	<p><code>void foo(int [42]);</code></p>

	<p><code>void foo(int []);</code></p>

	<p><code>typedef int t_array[23];<br>
		void foo(t_array);</code></p>

	<p><code>void foo(int *);</code></p>

	<p>A more common example is <code>int main(int argc, char *argv[])</code>, which
		is the same as <code>int main(int argc, char **argv)</code>. However,
		<code>int main(int argc, char argv[][])</code> would be an error because the
		above rule isn't recursive; the result after conversion would be
		<code>int main(int argc, char (*argv)[])</code>, i.e. <code>argv</code> would be a
		pointer to an array of unknown size, not a pointer to a pointer.</p>

	<h2>Conclusion</h2>

	<p>Arrays by themselves are nearly useless in C. Even the fundamental
		<code>[]</code> operator, which is used for getting at the array's contents,
		is an illusion: it's defined on pointers and only happens to work with
		arrays because of the rule that any use of an array outside of
		<code>sizeof</code> and <code>&amp;</code> yields a pointer.</p>
