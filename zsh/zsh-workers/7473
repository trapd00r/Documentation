This isn't a bug, local special parameters are supposed to stay special; it
would have been much easier if they weren't.  At least, I could change it
but then things like `local PATH=...' (which is now documented) wouldn't
work.  The variable in cvs ought to be changed anyway, but I'm a million
patches behind with completion and I'm logged in from a PC with only a
third-rate version of telnet.
