Subject: Odd trap return status
Date: Tue, 21 May 2002 16:19:55 +0100
Message-ID: <21074.1021994395@csr.com>
From: Peter Stephenson <pws@csr.com>

% inner() { trap 'return 1' EXIT; return 2; } 
% outer() { inner; print Not executed; return 3; }
% outer; print $?
2

I think that ought to be 1.  Somehow the return value of inner is being
preserved instead of the value specified.  (Remember the EXIT trap runs
in the scope of `outer'; this seems to be working OK.)

Unfortunately there's no other shell with which to compare since they
don't apply EXIT traps to functions.
