Since the ISO week is 52, %G is still saying 1999, wich is right.

       %G     The ISO 8601 year with century as a decimal number.
              The 4-digit year corresponding to the ISO week num­
              ber  (see  %V).  This has the same format and value
              as %y, except that if the ISO week  number  belongs
              to  the  previous  or  next year, that year is used
              instead.

You may want to use %Y instead.
