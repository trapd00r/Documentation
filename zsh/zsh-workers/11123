Just to make sure we mean the same thing. It *does* insert nslookup. The
example above was slightly incorrect; the actual screenshot after TAB is
(with cursor immediately after nslookup)

bor@itsrm2% nslookup<CURSOR HERE>
Completing external command
nslookup
Completing shell function
nslookup

So, in this case I believe, that

- no list is to be displayed (we have just a single match)
- exact match should be immediately accepted and space inserted

If you like to see list in this case ... another style?
