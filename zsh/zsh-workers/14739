Somehow I think the OS should ensure that such files can't be deleted
(by renaming them as it does for the .nfs* files or something).

Hm, things could break terribly if mapped function files disappear and I
don't see a completely satisfying solution.  Searching again for the zwc
file works for functions that haven't been loaded yet, but what about
those that were used already?

This certainly depends on how you write it ;-)  And probably on the way
the system handles all this.


My first reaction would be to print a warning, suggesting to re-start
the shell and mark the funcdump structure to not be used again.  But
that's only one step back from re-searching and -opening it, as you
suggest.

In short: hm, shrug, dunno.


Bye
