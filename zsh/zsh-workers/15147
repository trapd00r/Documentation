} The other advantage of this is that, as Sven has pointed out, we can handle 
} systems with RTLD_LAZY by loading first and asking questions afterwards.

In addition to Zefram's remarks in 14786, it is also the case that on
some operating systems (Apollo Domain/OS is a specific if obscure example)
all executables and libraries are compressed and checksummed.  This makes
it (a) difficult[*] to read C strings out of the library without actually
loading it and (b) impossible to add any uncompressed data to the library
file and still load it as a library.

We can of course choose not to support dynamic modules on any such OS.

[*] I'm not aware of any API for reversing the compression on Domain/OS.
