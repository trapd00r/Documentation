Careful with these.  They may be expecting to be called in a context
where the caller has declared expl as a local.

In general, if a function file starts with #autload then it's a
utility and should NOT declare completion system variables as locals,
but if it starts with #compdef then it should declare them local.
There are probably some exceptions, of course.
