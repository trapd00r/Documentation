As a minimal modification which omits the Perl script, how about

kshdot() { 
  setopt allexport localoptions
  source =(ksh -c ". $* 1>&2; typeset +x _ PWD; typeset -x")
}

This lists exported variables directly from ksh, which quotes them
where necessary; also it unexports _ and PWD (this does not reach back
to the calling zsh of course) so they don't appear in the list.  Since
ksh doesn't put the `export' in front, you can use `allexport'; that
only lasts for the length of the function.

But remember you can make emulate local to a function.  You might get
away with something like

kshdot() { emulate ksh; setopt localoptions; . $*; }

at least for some of the scripts.
