Subject: Something like noglob to inhibit brace expansion?

Is there something akin to the noglob precommand modifier that I can use
to inhibit brace expansion?

  % alias pr='noglob print'
  % pr *
  *
  % pr {a,b,c,*}
  a b c *

What I'd like to see is {a,b,c,*}

I know that 'setopt ignorebraces' handles this in general, but it's not
a precommand modifier, so I don't see how I can use it like this within
an alias.

Does anyone know of any tricks to get this functionality within
an alias?

Thanks in advance.
