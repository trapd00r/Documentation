Sorry, I'm not answering you question, but just a note:

There's no such thing as a bashism as all (except for a few
little ones) bash features come either from ksh, zsh or (t)csh.

"select" is not standard (that is not in the POSIX sh, which
is the only standard you can expect both bash and zsh to conform
to (when called as "sh")) and is a kshism. It's also rather
useless as one can do the same thing easily without.
