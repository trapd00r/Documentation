There is an _ignored completer which completes ignored matches if no
others match. It's not entirely useful when the pattern is something
like *?.o though because a .c file tends to match. And it doesn't quite
do what you want. What you seem to be concerned with is the order in
which matches come up in menu-completion. I don't really use menu
completion myself so I've never thought about it. There is a file-sort
style but it probably isn't flexible enough. You might be able to use
file-patterns to put the .o etc files in a separate group which comes
later.
