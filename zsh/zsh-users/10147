Why not make it possible to have a time-based history-scheme instead
of a static size-based one?  What I mean is that since Zsh allows
history items to be timestamped, add another parameter $HISTAGE and
keep items "younger" than that value.  It could be given in days,
weeks, months and/or years, I suppose.
