This appears to be failing within setenv() which (as far as I can tell)
is being passed a perfectly valid string.  setenv() is supposed to fail
gracefully and set errno to ENOMEM if it doesn't fit in the environment
but apparently isn't.  I believe the environment size is limited by
ARG_MAX on POSIX-like systems, but it's not usually tested by the caller
(which doesn't know how much space is left).
