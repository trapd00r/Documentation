I am upgrading from 3.0.5 to 3.1.2-zefram4 so sorry if I missed something obvious.  

The arrow keys just don't work.  I tried doing a 
   zsh -f
   bindkey -d
and that does fix them.  I tried doing what I do for 3.0.5
   bindkey "^[OA" up-line-or-search
   bindkey "^[[A" up-line-or-search
and they still just beep at me.

This is on a Solaris 2.6 machines.  Thanks for any help, I can't
LIVE without my arrow keys and had to go back to 3.0.5. :-(

Thanks,
Andy
