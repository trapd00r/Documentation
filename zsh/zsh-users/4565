It's not surprising that "rehash" doesn't help, as all that does is
empty the command hash table, and correction treats the contents of the
command hash table as the correct spellings.

Does "rehash -f" (both empty the command hash and refill it again) help?

Do you use the HASH_LIST_ALL option?  Unless that option is set, the
command hash table does not automatically fill itself during correction.
