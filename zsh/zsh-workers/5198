Bad karma in my compctl manual patch: too many @enditem's.  For some
reason this only showed up when running texinfo.  Then, of course, I
had to change the text just before again.

+Here, if the string on the command line is tt(foo.bar), tt(compctl)
+first tries matching tt(foo)var(anything)tt(.bar)var(anything), as
