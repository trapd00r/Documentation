Hi,

 I defined a function like that:

     function listall() {
	    ls ${THISDIR}/*
     }

 and want to call it like

     listing=listall

 but after

     echo listing

 I got 

    listall

 back and not the listing as such. THISDIR is set correctly.

 Thank you very much for any help in advance !

 keep hacking!
