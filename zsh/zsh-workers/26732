Awesome news.

For the record, the two URIs Wayne posted in an earlier thread (I
think he only mentioned the read-only one in the message I am replying
to) are:

    git://zsh.git.sf.net/gitroot/zsh            (read-only)
    ssh://USERNAME@zsh.git.sf.net/gitroot/zsh   (read/write)

Finally, I can put my local cvs-to-git conversion to rest.
Thanks Wayne! :-)

Regards, Frank
