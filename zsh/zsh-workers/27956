While fixing locales is a viable workaround, the root cause is that svn
is not able to present its information in a machine-readable way.

Would it be worthwhile to try and lobby svn etc to support something
like --output text; --output xml (yah, yah, I know) etc?

Everything else feels like a kludge.

this, but that is _very_ dim.
