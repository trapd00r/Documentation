Ah, I see, sorry I didn't understand you.

Well, anyone on this and all neighbouring planets are invited to share
their functions with us anyway, and several people not on the -workers
list have done that in the past.

If you have the time to start a project so that we get even more
completion functions or improvements for completion functions as
input, we'd all be glad and you'll almost certainly get any support
from the -workers list we can give. 

I'm not quite sure how support for zstyle would look like, though,
because that's so user-dependent, but a list of things people can just
copy and paste into their init files might already be of great value,
I think.


And as for compctl: I don't plan to give it any support anymore and
don't care if others do. There is still that file with several
compctls in the distribution as a starting point.


Bye
  Sven
