does anyone have a piece of sample code showing practical usage of 
zsockets?  i'm not having success developing functioning zsocket code 
using a current zsh cvs code pull.  i've been working from the zshall man 
page and from the partial zsocket examples from zshlovers without success. 
any help would be appreciated.  thanks.
