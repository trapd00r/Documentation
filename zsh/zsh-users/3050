} I guess it's intentional now that all tests which fail in chpwd() cause
} TRAPZERR() to be executed.

Why do you guess that?  It's certainly a surprise to me.  Could you give
a more specific example of what you mean, though?  TRAPZERR() is called
any time any command exits with a nonzero status, in chpwd or anywhere
else, and as far as I can tell it always has (by coincidence, I rebuilt
zsh-2.4.306 yesterday, and TRAPZERR seems to behave the same there as in
3.0.6 and 3.1.7-pre-1).

} I recently started doing `setopt localtraps && unset -f TRAPZERR'
} because of some changes that took place for 3.1.7-pre-1.
} 
} However that led me to try the above, which dumps core
} on both 3.1.7-pre-1 and 3.1.6 when changing directory.

There is a bug in unsetting TRAPxxx (as opposed to resetting them to
something else) when localtraps is set.  You might try `trap - ZERR' or
`disable -f TRAPZERR' instead for now.
