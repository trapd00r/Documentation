i've run into a problem that i've not seen, before.  i haven't seen any 
mention on the list of this; if i missed it, please pass this over.

on windows 7, under cygwin 1.7.1, i'm guessing something akin to file 
locking is causing the following:

exec /bin/zsh -l
can't rename /home/user/.zsh_hist/zsh_host_user_picmar.new to $HISTFILE

when i unsetopt HIST_SAVE_BY_COPY, there is no error and session 
initialization proceeds with no problems.

i've not seen such behavior on windows xp/sp2 or xp/sp3 with cygwin.  is 
this perhaps a new phenomenon in win7?
