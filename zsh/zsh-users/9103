Thanx vmuch Bart,
The above solution however had a quoting problem, where the single quotes were preventing $1 being
evaulated.
I evntually fixed this by creating a global alias

alias -g egrepcmd='egrep -i "note [0-9]{3}.*pink" note???.txt'
filessubject=(${(f)"$(egrepcmd)"} )
print -C 1 $filessubject

But are there any other zsh solutions to the "eternal" quoting problem
