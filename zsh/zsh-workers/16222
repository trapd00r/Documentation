Sounds like as good a place as any.

Okay, here's a few suggestions then:

You've got a typo here:                          ^^^

Is that right? If so, uprmi is using a dodgy file url format. After
file:// it would normally be a hostname with file names occurring after
file:/. You're also losing the _urls feature of completing the current
directory after `file:' which I find really useful.

If it would be useful here, it would be easy to modify _urls to take -/
in addition to -g (which it already takes and passes to _files).

Do you mean _urls there?

An _wanted with description would be nice here (and similarly further
above).
