Subject: PATCH: doc fixes

A few minor doc fixes. I had saved these because I was going to go
through the documentation in detail on the weekend but we had the first
half decent weather here in ages so I didn't. Anyway, I'll commit these
now before I forget them and hopefully find some time to look through
the docs in detail before 3.1.7.
