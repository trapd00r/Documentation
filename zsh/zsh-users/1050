I miss my @ for executing _a aliases :)
 
the pdksh has it and this is cool for the bindkey -v lover.
(yes, we are still out there :) )

 what does the ksh do here:

 you create a macro like you can do in VI:
 this macro is an alias which begins with _ and it has only one character.
 e.g. 
 alias _a='2hitest :)'

 you now can invoke it with @a (notice: no underscore!)

 i miss this little dear command.
 this is ksh history and i would like to see it
 with the best shell of all times, too :)
