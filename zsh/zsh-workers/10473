Speaking as a QA person, there is a large distinction between closed and
fixed states.

A "fixed bug" is one that the developer has entered code that he believes
fixes the problem.

A closed bug is one that's been built, and successfully survives a unit test
and system test.

Lots of code crosses my desk that is "fixed" and somehow doesn't work because
of that piece of kryptonite in my pocket.
