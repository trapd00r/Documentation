Subject: PATCH: 3.0.6-pre-4: Sneaky history bug
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Start with an empty history, as with "zsh -f" or a non-login shell, and
then try to do a "quick substitution" on the nonexistent previous command
using the second character in $histchars (usually '^').  I found myself
in hend() with chwordpos == -2, which did all sorts of fun things when
memcpy was called with chwordpos * sizeof(short) as its third parameter.

I think only Wayne really knows what's going on in the code below, but
this patch at least seems to prevent zsh committing hara-kiri.  You end
up with an empty entry in the history, though.
