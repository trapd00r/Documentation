Still seeing the problem from zsh-workers/20057.
http://www.zsh.org/mla/workers/2004/msg00707.html
Here's a slight more compact version...
zsh -f
autoload -U compinit; compinit -C
zstyle ':completion:*' matcher-list 'r:|[ ]=** r:[^a-z]||[a-z]=**'
mkdir bug; cd bug
touch "steve green" "peter stephenson"
more st<TAB>
peter\ stephenson  steve\ green
more ./st<TAB>     # -> results in the following line
more ./
In the last case, after the tab is hit, the "st" characters are removed by zsh.

-FR.
