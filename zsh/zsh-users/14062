Start by capturing the output of "man zshbuiltins" on both machines
and compare.

Then capture "man zshbuiltins | colcrt -" or equivalent and compare.

If you don't find an explanation by that point, there's a problem with
the perl script.

One possibility is that "man" on Gentoo is producing UTF-8 output,
which the perl script probably can't deal with.  Try forcing another
locale.
