    The slash removing works here. It seems you don't have
'EXTENDED_GLOB' set. You must in order the recipe to work ;)

    And yes, the quoting completely screws the functioning of the
PATH, and the worst thing is that... it is not needed O:) Array
elements are separate words, so you just need to do this:

    setopt EXTENDED_GLOB
    path=(${${path//\/##/\/}%/})
    unsetopt EXTENDED_GLOB

    The setopt is only needed, obviously, if you don't have
EXTENDED_GLOB set, which you don't seem to have.

    Hope this helps :) At least it works for me with your example
above (and adding a directory with spaces in it.
