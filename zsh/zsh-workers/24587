Yes, this is pretty cool.  I suppose the things that might work better
are e.g. completion of modifiers after !!: and $var: ?

(That was probably there before ...)

It'd also be nice if, for example, it would notice that the qualifier
needs to be followed by a numeric value and wouldn't complete another
qualifier the number was present, but that's a nit.
