I've uploaded zsh-4.3.6-dev-1.tar.gz to ftp.zsh.org in the directory
pub/development.  For some reason I failed to ftp it back in one go using
the corresponding URL, but cd'ing to the directory and getting it
worked.  If the URL works for you, it's

ftp://ftp.zsh.org/pub/development/zsh-4.3.6-dev-1.tar.gz

Also preformatted documentation in zsh-4.3.6-dev-1-doc.tar.gz .

This is a test version for 4.3.7.  It would be very useful if people
good try this out on as many system types as possible and report
problems.

Thanks.
