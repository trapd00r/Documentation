Status: OR

The new --enable-{zshenv,zshrc,zlogin,zprofile,zlogout} config options
replace the short-lived --enable-etcdir.  Is there any reason we can't
have both, with the latter providing the defaults for the former?
Five options for basically one change is a bit heavy.

Also, would an --enable-rsh-bug-workaround be useful, just to highlight the
option?
