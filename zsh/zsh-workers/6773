Subject: I've been fooling with menu-selection ...

It looks pretty nice, but how do you accept a selection and get on with
it?  I get in there and can cursor happily around, but I never seem to
be able to make it take one of the choices and let me go on with the rest
of the command line.  Sometimes a space will do it, other times I have to
hit ^G, which may or may not abort the whole command line.

And the listing doesn't always get erased once I've managed to get it to
make a choice, though it always is upon accept-line or repeated send-break.

Finally, I wanted to mention that I got it into a state where the highlight
was not visible -- I could only tell where I was because the word on the
command line kept changing as I pressed the arrow keys.  Eventually I think
I crossed back over the word that had been offered as the initial choice
(which was in the middle of the list somewhere -- I think it restarted an
old menu completion after I thought I'd broken out) and then the hightlight
came back.

Nevertheless, for a quick hack it's pretty slick.
