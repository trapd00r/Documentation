I also have, sometimes, this kind of problem. Would it be possible to
add a ZLE widget like "file-complete" (that would be bound, for instance,
to Ctrl-Tab) which forces the completion to happen in a "basic" way, rather
than with the new functions-customized system? It is very annoying to have
to type a full filename...

Or may be such a widget already exists?
