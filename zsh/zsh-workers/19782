This must be from the EF_RUN test in doshfunc, right?  (Because of the
logic for autoload +X you can't get it the other way.)  That means you
see the message just after the outer kshtest is run, I think.

I believe (but haven't checked) we always duplicate a function to
execute so that it's safe to unfunction while it's being executed.
Could that be failing here?
