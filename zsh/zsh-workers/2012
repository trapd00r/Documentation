This really is a shot in the dark, but...

My system's admin just built zsh for me on most of the computers that he's
in charge of.  Unfortunatly he couldn't get it to build on the RS6000's.
Since my shell is zsh, I can't log into those machines to get any more info
that this:
IBM AIX Version 3 for RISC System/6000

& the output of make, which my sysadmin sent me.  I've included that below.

I can't think of a way to get the version of the compiler either.

Hopefully I'll be able to get to an xterm at some point.  I believe that
you can specify your shell with one, but I have never tried it.

If someone has some other suggestions, feel free to mail them to me, and
I'll forward it to the list.

Jason
