The following is guaranteed repeatable on my system with 3.0.1-test3.
The terminal is an xterm.

% zsh -f
% compctl -D -X 'Default completion' -f
% setopt alwayslastprompt 
% ls xxx^D                           # there's no such file
Default completion              xx
#                                 ^ cursor is here, one line too low.

By the way, should alwayslastprompt be on by default?  There was some
discussion about this years ago when Sven wrote it and I was rather
surprised to find it wasn't when I tried the above.  It's not clear to
me why it shouldn't be.
