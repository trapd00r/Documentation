For years now I've been building zsh and running it from the source tree
for testing.  I'm used to this meaning that some modules are not loadable
when I run "Src/zsh -f" (because the modules haven't been installed yet).

Recently, however, I've started getting an error I never did before --

schaefer[602] Src/zsh -o noglobalrcs -f
zsh: failed to load module `zsh/zle': /usr/local/lib/zsh/4.3.6-dev-0/zsh/zle.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

-- so either zle has stopped being linked in the same way, or something
is causing zle to [try to] be loaded at startup when it never was before.
I think it's the former but I can't be certain.

I have stuff in my .zshenv to fix the module_path and that still works as
it always has; it's only the behavior with -f that's changed.

Either zle should be static linked, or the shell should not implicitly
load it (or at least not complain when it can't).
