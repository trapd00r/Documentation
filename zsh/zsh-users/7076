Hm, now the cursor stays at the beginning of the command line when I
haven't typed anything and press the up cursor - contrary to the
movement to the end of the command line with "up-line-or-search".
Probably because of the missing "up-line" functionality.

It's a bit of a nuisance because I more often change things at the end
of a command line than at the beginning but I think the extra
functionality of "history-beginning-search-backward" makes it a gain
for me though.
