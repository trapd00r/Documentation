} This will change the error given when running a script

I've actually been wondering whether this sort of thing should be
configurable (PS5, anyone?).  In some circumstances one might not
want line numbers at all; in fact, in some cases one might rather
see

	badcommand: command not found

instead of

	scriptname: command not found: badcommand
