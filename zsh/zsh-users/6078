You're right not to be sure, it doesn't.

Correct.

Certainly possible, but will need some extra wiring.  I should think
thre's some possible fudge involving locallevel, scanendscope and a new
parameter flag, rather than adding a completely new mechanism.  I think
options could be a bit tricky, given that we're talking about having the
mechanism apply exactly around the point at which most people set their
options.  You need to set up the local parameter scope immediately on
entry to .zshrc.

Followups to this should go to zsh-workers.
