Nope -- appended history still appends just fine.  As mentioned, zsh
re-opens the history file for every append, so it matters not if the
file gets rewritten to a new inode.  Also, every append and every
rewrite is locked by using a .zhistory.LOCK file, so multiple shells
don't update the history file at the same time.

Zsh also periodically rewrites the history file when the number of
appended lines exceeds the SAVEHIST count by a certain percentage.
