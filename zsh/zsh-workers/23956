I think it would probably be better to let the windows have arbitrary names
and store them in a linked list, as we do for ztcp and zftp.  Presumably
there aren't going to be that many of them.  (The names can still be
numbers, obviously.)

I'm also wondering if it wouldn't be better for the window number/name
to be the first regular argument in all cases.
