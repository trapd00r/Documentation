Subject: 4.0.1-pre-4: _lp:compset:5: missing string for option -P


I haven't tried pre-5 so maybe this is already fixed.  I haven't
investigated as thoroughly as I usually would given time
constraints...

zsh -f
autoload -U compinit
compinit -C -D
lpr TAB

generates

_lp:compset:5: missing string for option -P

on a fairly vanilla RedHat 7.1 system.  Has this already been fixed?
