} Hmm, you're right, it's one of the *really* recent ones, probably either
} 11777 or 11776 (I hope not 11768).  I had to re-"make install" to see it.

It was 11777.  Confusion about a double-negative, or something like that.
Sven changed a test to be:

	if ! zstyle -T ":completion:${curcontext}:" add-space; then

Either it should go back to what it was before:

	if zstyle -T ":completion:${curcontext}:" add-space; then

Or else it should use `-t':

	if ! zstyle -t ":completion:${curcontext}:" add-space; then

The two are subtly different; the former means "no value for add-space is
set to for the current context" and the latter means "it is not the case
that add-space is set to one of `true', `yes', `on' or `1' for the current
context."
