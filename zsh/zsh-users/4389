It depends on where and how you're defining the TRAPCLD function, I guess.
My assumption would be that if stdout is redirected, then the child that's
exiting must not be a child of the top-level interactive shell, and thus
changing the terminal title would at best be a waste of effort.

Remember, it's the stdout of the *parent* of the exiting job that we're
testing here.
