From: Sven Wischnowsky <wischnow@informatik.hu-berlin.de>
To: zsh-workers@sunsite.auc.dk
Subject: Multi-completion-functions


Since we are talking about as-yet-uncommitted patches, I'd like to
take the opportunity to remind us of the last one of these: 12977, the 
patch that tries to make using completion functions that implement
completion for more than one command easier. That `services'-thing.

Bye
 Sven
