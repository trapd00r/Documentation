This looks easy to use.

Could there be a way to make the completion 
functions autodescribe themselve?  (i.e.  
print styles and tags used by the function, 
as well as other info worth to know, in some 
standard way).  Perhaps it can be made by 
using some special comments in the completions 
functions and having a simple shell 
function that take a command as argument, 
that find the completion function
associated and format out these comments.
