Does this only happen with "-rf" or is it independent of options to rm?

You must have a zstyle of some kind for "rm", because it has no special
completion function; "ls" has a completion function, but neither "ln"
nor "touch" does, so e.g. "rm" and "ln" should behave the same.

Quite a number of completion bugs or misbehaviors were fixed for 4.3.9
so your configuration might very well behave differently (see earlier
thread about changes in completion for "..").

For starters, compare

% ln <ctrl-x>h

with

% rm <ctrl-x>h

I'd expect the output to be identical in both cases.
