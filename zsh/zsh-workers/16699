It seems to be the code with HISTEXPIREDUPSFIRST in
putoldhistentryontop() setting the next pointer to something that's
about to be free, but I don't remotely understand the code well enough
to be sure.  I made it go away by setting next to NULL if it was
pointing to something that was being freed, but I have no idea if this
is correct, or if that should ever happen.

Whether or not I do that, I now get:

+11:15% unsetopt histexpiredupsfirst
+11:15% HISTSIZE=1
+11:15% h
fc: no such event: 832

This doesn't happen if HISTSIZE is 2 or larger.
