yodl_2.13.2.orig.tar.gz from
http://sourceforge.net/projects/yodl/
seems to work. Try

$ perl contrib/build.pl make
$ sudo perl contrib/build.pl install

The latter will install binary and macors into /usr/bin and /usr/share/yodl,
man pages into /usr/share/man, and docs into /usr/share/doc/yodl.
Try 'perl contrib/build.pl' for more info, or read INSTALL.txt.
