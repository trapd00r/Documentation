} Couldn't really decide.  With that, you need to change the prompt if you
} unset PROMPT_PERCENT.

Hmhm.  Doesn't make that much difference to me, really, but why would it
be a big deal to `setopt localoptions promptpercent' within zcalc?  As it
stands, zcalc is ignoring the surrounding promptpercent setting anyway; it
just happens to also be ignoring the surrounding prompt(subst|bang).

} I'm not sure it's good to force that on users of a function.

Force what?
