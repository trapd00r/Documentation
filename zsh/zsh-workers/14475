quote SYST from ncftp correctly gives UNIX Type: L8. At the end of
zfanon's about, I get:
500 Syntax error, command unrecognized.
which might have something to do with it. The server is ftp.plig.org if
that helps. If you can't repeat it, it may be something caused by the
firewall here which has been causing a few problems with ftp recently.
