Hello,

I found the following bug in zsh 4.0.4:

If the current history number is less than 1000, zsh crashes after
1000G in vi command mode.

Also, I wonder if there is a way to completely reset history in the
interactive session and start from event 1?  It would be useful for
example in zcalc function, which re-reads the shell history.  Right now
each call increases the history number by $SAVEHIST.

Thank you all, zsh is amazing.

Pavol
