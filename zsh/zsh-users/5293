When I try as a regular user to remove a directory owned by root I get
the question twice:

9:43 mmj@tiger:// > rm -r twoqestions 
rm: remove write-protected directory `twoqestions'? y
rm: remove write-protected directory `twoqestions'? y
rm: cannot remove directory `twoqestions': Permission denied
zsh: 921 exit 1     rm -v -r twoqestions

Anyone else seing this, and if so, how to make it only once? With 4.0.4
the question was only asked once.
