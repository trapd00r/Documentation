Subject: parameter expansion within a string not working?
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1; format=flowed
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Content-Disposition: inline

To demonstrate:

$ zsh -f -c 'blah=(xa xb ya yb); print ${(t)blah}; print 0${blah:#x*}0'
array
0ya yb0

as expected.  However:

$ zsh -f -c 'blah=(xa xb ya yb); print ${(t)blah}; print "0${blah:#x*}0"'
array
00

which I found rather surprising.  Am I missing something regarding
expansions within double-quotes?
