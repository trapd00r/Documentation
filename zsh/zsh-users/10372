Yes, it's in the parameter WORDCHARS (described in the zshparam manual and
referred to under forward-word but nowhere else in the zshzle manual).
Remove "/" to get the behaviour you want.

WORDCHARS=${WORDCHARS/\/}

If you'd like a more configurable way of doing this (having different
functions that either do or don't use / as a character in a word) see
the entry for the set of functions forward-word-match etc. in the
zshcontrib manual page.

(A while ago we were thinking about some contextual way of doing this so
that it would make /'s delimiters in file names, but nothing much came
of it.)
