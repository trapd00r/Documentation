        If you've got a perl XS wrapper for your library, you could
use the embedded perl module to use that from zsh.

        This was back against plain 3.1.6, so it might not work
against pws-12.  Of course I'm going on vacation for a week+ in a
little while so version 0.02 probably will work with pws-12 soon. :)
