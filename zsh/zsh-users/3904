You need to install the dynamically-loadable modules before you can run
zsh from the build directory.

You need "make distclean" before reconfiguring.

I recommend that you use a more recent version -- we're up to 4.0.1-pre-5,
IIRC -- and use the default configuration (with dynamically loadable
modules).  Do "make install.modules" before testing the new binary
("make check").
