Subject: Make the `users-hosts' style take precedence?
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

I have these styles:

zstyle -e ':completion:*:(ssh|scp):*' hosts 'reply=(
    ${=${${(f)"$(cat {/etc/ssh_,~/.ssh/known_}hosts(|2)(N) \
		     /dev/null)"}%%[# ]*}//,/ }
    ${=${(f)"$(cat /etc/hosts(|)(N) <<(ypcat hosts 2>/dev/null))"}%%\#*}
    )'
zstyle ':completion:*:(ssh|scp):*:my-accounts' users-hosts \
    schaefer@{candle,dazzle,gleam,chimney}.brasslantern.com

When completing after `ssh schaefer@', I'd like to be offered only those
host names that came from the users-hosts style, and not all the others
from the hosts style.  How do I accomplish this?  I'd use the tag-order
style, except that `my-accounts' is not a "real" tag for this purpose.

One other oddity:  If I type `ssh @', then move the cursor back so it's
over the `@', and then press TAB, I would expect to complete user names
because that's what should appear to the left of an `@'.  Instead it
offers both users and host names -- but in THIS case, the only hosts
offered *are* those from the users-hosts style.
