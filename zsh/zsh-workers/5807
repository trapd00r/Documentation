It looks like this was a VPATH feature I've noticed before.  If you've
produce the files signames.c, modules-bltin etc. in the main Src directory,
and VPATH is set to that, it will insist on overwriting those files.
Anyway, I've tried again with a clean source hierarchy and it built
flawlessly in another directory.
