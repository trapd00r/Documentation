Isn't this the correct fix?  The problem with hn being NULL is because
the later code uses is_builtin which assumes it isn't NULL.  So we need
to take account of is_builtin being set (from the previous time through
the loop) at this point, too.

The error message for 'command -v blub' is now `no such builtin: -v'.
Is that correct?  I don't see any documentation for the fact that the -v
argument isn't handled when posixbuiltins is set.
