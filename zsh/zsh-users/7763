Let's see ... fire up "info zsh", type "i", search the index for "equal" 
and the first hit is:

EQUALS <Z>
     Perform = filename expansion.  (See *Note Filename Expansion::.)

Follow the link to Filename Expansion.  About half way down the page:

If a word begins with an unquoted `=' and the EQUALS option is set, the
remainder of the word is taken as the name of a command.  If a command
exists by that name, the word is replaced by the full pathname of the
command.
