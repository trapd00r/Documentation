Setting the style to an empty string gives you the internal defaults,
which should eb the same as the defaults for GNU ls (if we've found
that out correctly).

The solution is to transfer the $LS_COLORS from the Linux box to the
BSD box. Unless you want to install the whole GNU fileutils suite
there, as suggested by others.
