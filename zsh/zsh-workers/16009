man mount:
              The type iso9660 is the default.  If no  -t  option
              is  given,  or  if  the auto type is specified, the
              superblock  is  probed  for  the  filesystem   type
              (minix,  ext, ext2, ext3, xiafs, iso9660, reiserfs,
              romfs, ufs, ntfs,  qnx4,  bfs,  xfs,  cramfs,  hfs,
              hpfs,  adfs,  vxfs  are  supported).  If this probe
              fails,  mount   will   try   to   read   the   file
              /etc/filesystems,  or,  if  that  does  not  exist,
              /proc/filesystems.  All  of  the  filesystem  types
              listed  there  will be tried, except for those that
              are labeled "nodev" (e.g., devpts, proc and nfs).

[root@cooker root]# rpm -q mount
mount-2.11j-2mdk

of course, man page for mount is in different RPM so it may apply to
totally different command altogether :-)
