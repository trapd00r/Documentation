} I don't think this does the right thing.  Consider <(...).

I don't think there's a simple fix to getproc() that will handle this.
Some work is going to have to be done only when both the child process
from inside the <(...) and the one supposedly reading it have exited.
That means recording that information somewhere and dealing with it in
handler() or in the job table code.
