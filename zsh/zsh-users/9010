Go to http://www.zsh.org/cgi-bin/mla/wilma/users and search for "keeper".

Isn't the answer to this the same as -- or awfully similar to, at any
rate -- the answer to your "Creating a Case statement dynamically" 
thread from a couple of days earlier?


    local file command target
    find "$@" | keep
    for file in $kept
    do
	PS3="Action on $file: "
	target=''
	select command in mv cp rm gvim
	do
	    case $REPLY in
	    ((Q|q)*) break 2;;
	    (<1->) 
		case $command in
		(cp|mv) vared -e -p "$command $file " target &&
			[[ -n $target ]] && $command $file $target
		(?*) $command $file;;
		(*) break;;
		esac;;
	    (*) break;;
	    esac
	done
    done
