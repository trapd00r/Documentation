    Only if the behavior described in the text actually makes sense,
    that is, is this setting useful? Not if the _approximate completer
    bypasses the smarts that make _cvs offer only unversioned files to
    cvs add, only versioned (or scheduled for addition) files to cvs ci,
    etc.
    
    I don't actually know what will _cvs do with this completer
    (svn everywhere I look), I'm just saying this should be considered.
