I've now committed this.  The tests all pass (one error message changed
due to the fact that option arguments are now handled generically), but
keep a watch out for oddities.

I updated the version to 4.1.0-dev-6 owing to the fact that the
interface between the shell and builtins in modules is now different.

I haven't tackled `cd'.  It would be sensible also to add a BINF_ flag
for `skip -- but don't attempt to parse options otherwise'.
