} even if I change it with export PROMPT.

In zsh the parameters prompt, PROMPT, and PS1 are all synonyms -- if any
of them is changed, the others are as well.  Depending on how you start
zsh, a value for PS1 may be getting exported into the environment after
your setting of PROMPT.  For example, the startup files for the bash
shell often export a PS1 setting.

Which Linux distribution are you using?  Did you install zsh from an RPM?
