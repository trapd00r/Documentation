Subject: compadd -qS' ' should escape the space
MIME-Version: 1.0

The following code will only do the right thing if I have started the
current word with a ":

  declare -a colors

  colors=(black red green yellow blue magenta cyan white)

  _describe -t color 'color' colors -qS' '

I'd expect the space used as a suffix to be escaped.

Thanks.
