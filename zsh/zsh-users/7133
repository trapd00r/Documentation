When I use completion with the cd command, zsh tries to complete
to both directories and named directories, probably because I have
CDABLE_VARS set. I would like cd to complete to directories by
default, and if it is not possible (and only in this case), then
the completion to named directories is performed. How can I do
that?

I have the above behavior with both zsh 4.1.1 and zsh 4.2.0-pre-3
under Debian.
