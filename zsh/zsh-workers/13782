Clearing the job table is handled specially in entersubsh().

    if (cl)
	clearjobtab();

MONITOR gets unset at this point, too.  It shouldn't be necessary to do
both, and it should be possible to hack bin_fg() so that it can still list
jobs even if it can't control them.  In fact, it looks like this is half
there: `fg' and `bg' test for !jobbing and complain, whereas `jobs'
doesn't and silently scans the empty job list.  So maybe not clearing the
job table and relying on the option setting just works.  But it needs a
proper work through to make sure.
