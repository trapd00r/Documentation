Z> What's wrong with $((18+(${2:-1}-1)*24)) ?

Err, nothing, it should work too but it doesn't:

$ TZ=GMT-$((18+(${2:-1}-1)*24)) date +%j
zsh: ')' expected

Z> And the line above works for me (2.6-beta11-test7).

Yes, you're right. It works in 2.6-b10 as well, so I presume the bug
is restricted to the hzoli releases (though I've only verified up to
hzoli10.2). I should have checked this prior to my original post to
the list.

Thanks for the info.
