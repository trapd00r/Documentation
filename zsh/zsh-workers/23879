Why use "$revision_arguments[@]"?  $revision_arguments works just as
good and you don't need all the quoting and expansion fluff.  I see
this style has been used for $merge_args as well, even though most of
the file doesn't.

I don't like this at all.  Why not simply use __git_cached_files?  And
if we really need __git_committishs, let's at least use a separate
function for that with proper descriptions and tags.
