Subject: Preventing "no matches found:"

X-Mailer: Apple Mail (2.733)
X-Spam-Checker-Version: SpamAssassin 3.0.4 (2005-06-05) on f.primenet.com.au

X-Spam-Status: No, score=-2.6 required=5.0 tests=BAYES_00 autolearn=ham 
	version=3.0.4

Is there some way to indicate that patterns may have no matches? I am  
doing a cron job that does cleanup of all files older than a certain  
time and have a line like:

   rm ~/log/**/*.log(m+7)

and would like to avoid the message:

   no matches found: ~/log/**/*.log(m+7)

by somehow indicating, either through a setopt or a parameter for (),  
that no matches is not an error.

Thanks.
