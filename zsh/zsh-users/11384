Hi,

Actually there are many ways to read the file line by
line. Three of the popluar ones are:

1.

for i in `cat filename`
do
echo $i
done

* This method works only if the file has only single
word in every line. Else it fails

2. Like Micah J. Cowan pointed out, 

while read i
do
echo $i
done < filename

3. The below example is taken from
http://open.itworld.com/5040/nls_unix_filedescriptor060608/page_1.html


$ read <&3 myline

The variable "$myline" will then contain the first
line from the file. Repeat the read command and we
will get the second line and so on. We might,
therefore, use a script like that shown below to read
and process each line in a file. Notice the comments
inserted into the spot where we would process each
line in some way in whatever way we want. 

if [ $# != 1 ]; then
    echo "Usage: $0 input-file"
    exit 1
else
    infile=$1
fi

# assign file descriptor 3 to input file
exec 3< $infile

until [ $done ]
do
    read <&3 myline
    if [ $? != 0 ]; then
        done=1
        continue
    fi
    # process file data line-by-line
    # in here ...
    echo $myline
done

echo "The End"


Regards,
sac.
