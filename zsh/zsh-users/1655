} [... aliases] seem to unset themselves!  I have them in ~/.zshrc
} and straight after I log in everything is  fine, but after a while
} when I go to use one of these aliases I get "zsh: command not found".

Try putting

	disable unalias disable

at the end of your .zshrc, and then while you use the shell, watch for
one of -those- to be reported as not found.
