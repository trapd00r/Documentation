The patch I sent behaves like bash, i.e. shows the list on the second
tab. My first attempt didn't (I ran docomplete(COMP_COMPLETE) once,
*then* docomplete(COMP_LIST_COMPLETE) if lastambig was non-zero,
instead of running docomplete(COMP_COMPLETE) only if lastambig was
zero) but the one I sent does.

I haven't tried LIST_AMBIGUOUS + AUTO_LIST, so I can't comment on
whether or not my patch behaves like that.
