What was wrong with AC_SEARCH_LIBS?

No, that won't do. I (being on SVR4) need '-lsocket -lnsl' for any
networking code (what our Solaris fellas say?) Moreover, I *do* need them
both in *main* module and not in any DSO (else some funny effects may
happen).

I really suggest that this patch should be hold off till 4.0.1 release. It
is just too dangerous and can break too much.

Not everybody is using Linux ... yet :-)
