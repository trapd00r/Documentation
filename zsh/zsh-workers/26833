Subject: Vastly better HTML docs

I've (finally) figured out how to generate a HTML version of the zsh 
docs with sane and helpful file and anchor names.   And it's really 
easy.

The HTML version of the zsh docs are generated from the texinfo version 
by a program called texi2html.  The version that is currently being 
used to generate the online copy of the docs is 1.64, which was 
released in 2000 (!) and whose maintainer hasn't released a new version 
since.  However, the project has been taken up by another maintainer, 
who has put out more recent releases, (available from 
http://www.nongnu.org/texi2html/ ), with some extremely nice features.

If you generate the zsh docs with the current version (1.82), and use 
the --node-files option, it will make html files with *actual* 
*descriptive* *names* (like "Shell-Grammar.html", or 
"Editor-Functions-Index.html").

**EVEN BETTER**, the index anchors, which in the current version are 
opaque, unguessable numerical codes, are now self-evident, easily 
guess-able links like "#index-compadd" or 
"#index-background-jobs_002c-notification" (_002c is a comma -- maybe 
not totally obvious, but understandable once seen).

Combining these, you get the very automatable, human-readable URLs 
like: "Options.html#index-EQUALS" for the EQUALS option, etc.

And the whole things is very customizable, so if we want to change it 
(maybe making underscores, which currently show up as "_005f", 
something simpler), we can do so easily...

It would be great to get these improved URLs live on the various zsh 
doc mirrors, so we can start linking to them from the wiki, and other 
places.

Let me know how else I can help with this,
