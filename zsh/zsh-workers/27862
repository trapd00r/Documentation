I'm not understanding why this matters to the next question.

} Isn't _x_arguments dead since XOrg?

Could you explain that a little more?  I *think* what you mean is
"since XOrg released X11R7.x".  I don't have access to a system with
that installed; on my CentOS4 system, with XOrg 6.8, it's still
working fine.  Is there anything OTHER THAN the following that
should be changed?
