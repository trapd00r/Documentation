I guess "recent" may be relative (Sun 1 you say?), but I've been using
the following for at least 7 years.  I do something like

  % xtctl size 100 60 move 0 0

all the time on XTerm, rxvt (cygwin no less), OSX Terminal.app, and
PuTTY.  That ctlseqs.ms certainly does get around....

(If it looks naive, it's because I was limiting it to Bourne shell,
mostly for fun.  At some point while implementing 'get' I gave up and
switched to bash, but it's been so long now that I don't remember why.)

Err, Gnus helpfully informed me that there was a literal ^[ and ^G in
there (Bourne shell...), so here's a link instead:
http://www.isri.unlv.edu/~slumos/hacks/xtctl.  It's mostly a curiosity
at this point anyway...
