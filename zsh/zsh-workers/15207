This is similar to POSIX, as is the reference on Bracket Expressions.

What confuses me is where it says that the backslash loses its special
meaning within a bracket expression.  I see that backslash-escapes
take precedence over bracket expressions in BRE's, but, as you noted,
pattern matching is not BRE's.
