"zstyle" is a generic command similar to "typeset" -- it has no
understanding of the semantics or internal structure of its arguments;
even the use of colons to separate components is entirely a convention
invented for the completion system and makes no difference to zstyle.
So there really is no point prior to lookup where any particular style
can be analyzed for reporting an error, and if you've made an error in
the style context itself it'll never be looked up.

Perhaps more later on the rest of your questions, I'm out of time to
investigate just now.
