Subject: problems with 3.1.9 on cygwin

Hello,

So I just noticed that 3.1.9 is advertised to work under cygwin... 
but is it supposed to work *well* yet?

I notice that "echo *" seems to only ever yield "no matches found".

And there seems to be a bug where setting (but not exporting) a
variable in one script and 'source'ing another does not result in the
second script seeing that variable.  But I've not been able to
reproduce this with a succinct example.

Can someone fill me in on the state of cygwin support?

many thanks,
