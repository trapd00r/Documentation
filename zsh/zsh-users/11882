Subject: bug? - how to skip precmd
To: zsh-users@sunsite.dk
X-POM: The Moon is Full
X-Hashcash: 1:20:0709260929:zsh-users@sunsite.dk::4mHX0Ix+lQ6JK6sF:0000000000000
	0000000000000000000000001Zcs

if i run a simple command followed by:
 	&& return
  or
 	&& return n
my precmd is ignored. that's just weird...

of course, if the simple command returns a non-zero exit status, then the 
behavior can be duplicated with:
 	|| return [n]
