Crap, I sent this to Michael instead of the group accidentally...
Sorry Michael!

'1>' or just '>' redirects STDOUT, '2>' redirects STDERR, and '&>'
redirects both.  My test case should redirect both.  Try getting rid of the
'2' in your example and it will still give the behavior that you
described.  jobs is doing something special, and the source code just
confused me more.  :)
