It's a "feature" of the new patch; you must add the 0 operand
explicitly now.

Patch without `-p' simply ignores the directory name; that aspect is
unchanged.

Why the patch developers chose to change patch behaviour now is
totally beyond me.  The change isn't significant enough to be called a
major breakage, but it certainly is annoying.  And there was *no need*
for it.
