Technically it should be "kill -s CONT".

Probably sbuild sent the SIGTERM long before you sent the SIGCONT, and
the build didn't react until you did.

Previously, this had only been seen using sbuild on ultrasparc, and
recently Kurt Roeckx reported a problem using sbuild on amd64.  I assume
you're using sbuild on m68k.  Yes?
