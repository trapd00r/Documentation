} I have a couple of keybinding requests:
} 
} 1) insert-second-to-last-word (in the same spirit as insert-last word,
} which I use constantly)

I think making insert-last-word read its prefix argument as a word
position would be preferable.  In the current code, insert-last-word
ignores the prefix, so this is a reasonably compatible change.

Drawback:  Word 0 is the command name, but ESC 1 ESC _ must count
from the right to be compatible with the past implementation (zsh is
not able to distinguish the 1 prefix from no prefix at all).  This
means all positive numbers should count from the right; which is OK
because the name is after all insert-last-word, so ESC 2 ESC _ means
insert the second word back from the end.  (Then you use bindkey -s
to put this on a single keystroke; presto, insert-second-last-word.)

So of course negative prefixes count from the left, with the slight
oddity that ESC 0 ESC _ also counts from the left (giving you the
command name).
