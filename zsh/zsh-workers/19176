    Hi all :)

    More than a year ago, a discussion took place about zsh/complist
not loading zsh/compctl. The problem was that zsh/complist checked
for zsh/complete instead of doing the same for a 'generic' completion
code loaded. That was fixed with a patch in zsh-workers 17567. It is
not in zsh 4.0.7, will it be in zsh 4.1.0 or 4.0.8? Will even be a
4.0.8? When the release of 4.1.0 is planned?

    I know that the answer of most of the questions is 'who knows',
but just in case ;))) Thanks, as always, for zsh ;)
