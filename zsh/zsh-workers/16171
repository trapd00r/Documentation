Subject: PATCH: minor zftpsys doc changes.

Message-ID: <10741.1004094451@csr.com>
From: Peter Stephenson <pws@csr.com>

I noticed some small errors when reading through this.

I will also commit the change in 15893 to make zftp require zsh/net/tcp.  I
left it out in case I got the time to produce a more general patch which
makes lists of dependencies at compile time, compiles them into each module
which needs it, and handles the whole list at once when a module is
loaded, including unloading any earlier modules which were just loaded if a
later module in the list fails to load.  There's a fascinating exercise for
someone.
