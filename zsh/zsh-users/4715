Whoops, that's Geoff's zshmunge script.  The emails from the source list &
archive really have an X-Seq header which I've been transforming to the old
(Richard Coleman managed) GA-Tech style header (X-Mailing-List).  When
they were passed through to MHonarc they were munged.  I've changed it
to sunsike.dk now.
