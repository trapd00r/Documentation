That's exactly the point.  You're not allowed to use autocd in a script.
If shell functions had existed when autocd was invented, you probably
wouldn't be allowed to use it in a function either.  It's meant to be a
purely interactive feature -- but testing INTERACTIVE isn't sufficient,
because INTERACTIVE is still set during `. file'.
