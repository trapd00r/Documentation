I ran into the same thing with what I think is an HP-UX 10.20 machine.
My solution was to comment out lines 88-98 in Src/watch.c .. not a
great fix, but it eliminated the problem. Althought this machine has
<utmpx.h>, struct utmpx (or for that matter, anything else!) doesn't
have any definition of ut_xtime. However, since HP's aren't my primary
machines, a simple hack made me happy enough.

Hope this helps.. and maybe this can be fixed at some point..
