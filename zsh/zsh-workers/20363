Subject: PATCH: exit after 10 EOF's

The shell is supposed to exit after 10 EOFs if ignore_eof is set.
When zle is in use this appears to have been broken for a long time.
(It's not affected by my recent patch for aborting a list causing the
shell to exit, even though that touched the same code.)

I think the following patch is OK.  It duplicates the usual test from
the top-level loop inside zle, but if we're going to continue with the
feature that the "use 'exit' to exit" message is handled as a zle
message (which doesn't cause a new command line to be output) that seems
to be inevitable.

This ought to be part of the test suite, but with zle it needs zpty and
I don't understand the tests with zpty.
