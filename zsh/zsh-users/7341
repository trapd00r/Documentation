Actually I think backreferences in pattern matching is a pretty cool bit
already.

However, as you can treat strings as arrays and index them by character,
and also do slices with pairs of indices:

txt="Some text [particular text] Another text"
print -l $txt[1,$txt[(i)\[]-2] $txt[(r)\[,(R)\]] $txt[$txt[(I)\]]+2,-1]
