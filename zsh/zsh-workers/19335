I managed to reproduce this with zsh -f on a directory containing only
the files

touch $'\xd7\xa8\xd7\x90'
touch $'\xd7\xa8\xd7\x91'

As you say, it shouldn't be possible to have a Meta immediately before
the last character.  If there was a Meta or a NUL in the input it should
have been xored with 32 and a Meta stuck in front of it.  This suggests
the bug is actually earlier than ztrsub.
