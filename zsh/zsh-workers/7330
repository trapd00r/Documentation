The make ended thus:

Updated `zshpaths.h'.
Creating `zshxmods.h'.
cc -c -I.  -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -Wall -Wno-implicit -Wmissing-prototypes -O2  -o init.o init.c
init.c: In function `init_io':
init.c:360: too few arguments to function `fcntl'
init.c:364: too few arguments to function `fcntl'
*** Exit 1
Stop.

I will be happy to provide additional
useful information on request, if you tell
me what would help and how to get it.  I am
only a beginner.
