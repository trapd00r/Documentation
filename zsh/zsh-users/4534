Sorry for having a conversation with myself here, but I realized that it
has to do with splitting.  If in the second case I use
: ${(AA)=dict::=$(<${filename})}
or anything similar, like
: ${(AA)dict::=${(z)$(<${filename})}}
it all works.  Thinking about it (hopefully with a clearer head than last
night) the error message seemed to be the correct behavior.

However, the question remains: why did the first case (with the filename
given directly instead of by a parameter) work then?
