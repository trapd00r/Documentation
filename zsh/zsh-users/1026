 i don't know how to do that in command -mode, i can only try to do it
 in vi-insert-mode.
 bindkey -s "control-v and then control( pressed" "control-v ESC pressed then b" 
control-v is for quoting ESC in ed/sed/vi thinking.

 my question is, can i map commands to the so called
 command-mode or is it only possible in insert-mode for bindkey -v
?
