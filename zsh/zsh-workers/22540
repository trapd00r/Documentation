 "Questions about character types" (Jul  5,  1:14pm)

Seems OK to me.

Agreed.

} Another question is what to do with user names.  Currently these are
} just the ASCII identifier characters plus "-".  Is it useful to extend
} these to include alphanumeric characters from the local character set?

My impression is that it would be, but some non-English-speakers should
weigh in.

} Finally, I failed to interpret this code from math.c:
} 
} 	    if (*ptr == '+' && (unary || !ialnum(*ptr))) {
} 		ptr++;

I suspect that's a bug.  It probably originally said

	    if (*ptr++ == '+' && (unary || !ialnum(*ptr))) {

but someone realized it was wrong to increment the pointer if it was NOT
equal to plus, and made an incomplete fix.
