Mikael's interpretation might be the correct one, but I read this as
saying you don't want certain expansions.  If that's the case, there is
a certain amount of configuration, but you're going to have to be more
specific about what you want expanded or not.

There's no style specific to suppressing ~-expansions, though it's
probably not hard to add given that luckily the ~ is always at the
start.

You might simply want the subst-globs-only style, however.
