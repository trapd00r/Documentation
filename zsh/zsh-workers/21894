} I applied your patch [adding \r to IFS] to zsh 4.2.4 / Cygwin.  Now p4
} <tab> causes a segfault...

Do other completions also segfault, or just that one?  Do you get any
output at all from complete-debug (ctrl-x question-mark)?  Does it
change anything if you remove the \\0 (NUL) from the IFS assignment?

(I'm pretty much shooting in the dark on that last one.)
