Subject: Zstyle persistence
MIME-Version: 1.0

It just occurred to me that it might be useful to have zstyles automatically
saved on shell exit, like history.  I can't decide if it'd be a good idea to
automatically reload them, though -- an explicit "zstyle -R" in a startup
file might be preferable.
