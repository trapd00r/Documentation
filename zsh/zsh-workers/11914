Subject: ChangeLog is just too big
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

I can't "cvs update" from SourceForge if there are merge conflicts on the
ChangeLog file.  It just hangs forever.  I finally had to move my modified
ChangeLog out of the way, copy in the unmodified one I use for generating
diffs (so that I don't have to hit sourceforge for that), and then update.

I wish I had a good suggestion for what to do about this.
