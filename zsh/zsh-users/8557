Hi Peter !

 Thank you for your reply. :O)

 ...with my newbie-like understanding of zsh I could give
 
		zmv

 on the commandline then, but I get

	   zsh: failed to load module: zsh/zmv
       zmv: autoload failed

 ...

 I feel totally wrong in this case, but....WHAT is wrong ?


 Sorry for the real beginner's qeustions....

 Have a nice weekend!
 Meino
