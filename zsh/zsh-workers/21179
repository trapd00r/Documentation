You should probably get used to using -U or --unified for specifying
lines of context. With diffutils 2.8.1 it works with -u but with
diffutils 2.8.4, I get this:

% diff -u0
diff: `-0' option is obsolete; use `-U 0'

The completion function is correct for the newer diffutils so I'll leave
the function as it is.
