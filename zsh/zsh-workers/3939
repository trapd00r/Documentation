There was a policy decision made in 3.1.1 that, generally speaking, the
clever interactive options should be enabled by default.  It does change
the default behaviour, but it doesn't affect scripts (where compatibility
really matters), and the new behaviour is usually preferred.

The Etc/NEWS file does list new options.  These options being on by
default isn't listed, but this is a beta version, and it is listed in
the ChangeLog.

Possibility for zsh-workers: should `emulate' have the capability to
emulate earlier zsh versions?  So `emulate zsh-2.3' would turn off
LIST_AMBIGUOUS and so on.

ALWAYS_LAST_PROMPT.  One of my favourite features.  It means that you
don't waste screen space with old completion lists -- new lists visibly
replace the old one -- and the command line doesn't jump around, so
it's easier to keep your eyes on what you're editing.  This has been
available since 2.5.

I'm glad to see I'm not the only person that gets this emotional about
computer programs.

But ALWAYS_LAST_PROMPT is right.  It's SO right.  So vastly right that
having to use bash purees my brain when it puts the completion list in
the wrong place.

Bad analogy.  vi's popularity rests on having a simple and *complete*
interface.  zsh has a history of adding cool and unusual features.
Surely you can't expect us to make no progress in this direction in
two years?

>And this, unlike the first issue, can't even be fixed by toggling an option.

"unsetopt alwayslastprompt".

Yes.  In vi mode you'd have to fiddle with the key bindings to do it.
I doubt that anyone actually does this, though: just set the option the
way you want it.

You'll get used to it, if you use it.  I can understand how it might be
confusing when unexpected.
