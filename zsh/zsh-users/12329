I'm running this successfully on Solaris (Nevada build 79), but 'make
check' fails the "read multibyte characters" test in D07.  When I save the
test files aside to see why they differ, here's what I see:

    % xxd zsh.ztst.out.24635
    0000000: c2ab c2bb 0a                             .....
    % xxd zsh.ztst.tout.24635
    0000000: c2ab c2bb 000a                           ......

Looks like an extra null slipped in there.

I'm not sure how 4.3.4 does on this test, but I'll check and report back.

Danek
