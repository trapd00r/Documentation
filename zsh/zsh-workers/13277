Do you mean you prefer the current behavior or would like another?

: item(tt(r))(
:-Remove a trailing suffix of the form `tt(.)var(xxx)', leaving the basename.

:o)

I can't think of anything better either.  This is the
description used in the tcsh manual.  The original `basename' is
clearly misleading; `root name' may require a definition, or
else the `leaving the root name' part can be removed.  But at
least `root name' offers a mnemonic mean to remember what
thoses modifiers do (r-root e-extension h-head t-tail).
