} I was mostly thinking about a) ensuring that the tests for zle are run 
} before those for completion without having to start numbering at `50'
} or whatever and b) leaving room after all the basic shell stuff for
} user contributions and whatnot.

ZLE is either a module (my section X) or an interactive feature that has
to be tested with zpty (section Y) both of which precede completion (Z).

But of course it doesn't hurt to break it down further, and a section
for other stuff at the end doesn't hurt either.
 
} # Section V: builtins

You mean modules?
