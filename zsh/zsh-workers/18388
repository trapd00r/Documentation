As an add-on module this would be a very good thing to have.  It would
fit in well with existing modules such as zsh/parameter and zsh/mapfile.

One problem at present is we don't have a way of associating a parameter
with a particular implementation.  I think something from ksh93 would do
this.  Otherwise we can define some `tie'-like syntax for typeset.
