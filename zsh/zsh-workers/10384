:I'm curious whether you've found a way to prevent the generation of

:CVS is rather insistent that every directory is a "module" ... and

Yes, I was about to request this.  Aggregation of commit messages which
occur at the same time, plus or minus a few seconds (to account for
directory spanning when people might use ! to CVS to reuse a log message),
and with the same log info would be very nice.  Somewhere I've got a perl
program to insert into CVSROOT/loginfo, though it depends on what we can
run on their server.  Otherwise some external aggregator should/could be
set up.
