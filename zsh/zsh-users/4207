What exactly does zsh do differently once you *have* compiled in the
maildir-support option?  Doing a search on "maildir" in man zshall turns up
no information about --enable-maildir-support.  I have the option set, and
zsh is still giving no mail notification.

export MAIL=$HOME/.mailspool/rj
export MAILCHECK=1

mailpref=$HOME/Mail
mailpath=($HOME/.mailspool/rj
            $mailpref/z/'?New zsh mail.'
            $mailpref/m/'?New mutt mail.'
            $mailpref/trash/'?New mail in trash.')
