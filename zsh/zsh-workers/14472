How are you managing reconnect on timeout?  Using zfautocheck?

Looks like the zfconfig parameter maintained by the function system should
be storing the transfer type, which it isn't.

} This may just be something related to the particular ftp server

The doc (for raw zftp, not the function system) says:

     The FTP default for a transfer is ASCII.  However, if zftp finds
     that the remote host is a UNIX machine with 8-bit byes, it will
     automatically switch to using binary for file transfers upon open.
