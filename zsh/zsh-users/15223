I don't think we've ever attempted to support MSYS, and I'm guessing it's
not a lot like standard Unix, so we'd need someone with some fairly
detailed knowledge of it to volunteer to do so.  (Probably this only
touches the system level interaction, so detailed knowledge of zsh wouldn't
be so important.)  Unfortunately recent experience suggests that's highly
unlikely.
