Thanks Bart.

That worked fine.  I had to put it in the sh environment script
specified by $ENV, rather than /etc/zshrc, since zsh does not read
/etc/zshrc when run as sh.  I just though I would note that for anybody
else who might encounter this issue.

BTW, is there any particular reason there is no mention of the rlimits
module in the manual.  I did not find it when I searched zshall(1).  It
does cover ulimit under the build-in commands section.

Regards,
Vincent
