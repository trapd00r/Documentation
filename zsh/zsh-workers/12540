I didn't realize that readlink() was so unfriendly.  You could
memset() the buffer with 0 and then test to see if the final octet
of the buffer was still zero.  If it is, you have a complete,
zero-terminated string.  If not, realloc the buffer and try again.

I don't know if that's more or less ugly.

I don't understand the significance.
