Please excuse my ignorance, but would someone please advise if the following
paragraph from the zsh FAQ means that this option will NEVER be available
under Solaris 2.x or may be developed in a future version ?

  
*Note for Solaris 2.2 and 2.3*: The UCB versions of the routines for
  reading directories are not usable (the struct definitions are
  incompatible with the ones assumed by zsh).  Make sure you compile
  without any reference to /usr/ucblib in (e.g.) your LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
  The symptom of this is that globbed filenames will be missing the
  first two letters.

Please reply to ken@mitsui.oz.au
