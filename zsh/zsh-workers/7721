There is only one vendor branch. What I do (with Perforce and not CVS but
the principle is more or less the same) is to import each  pws (and
release) on the vendor branch and apply the patches on the main trunk.

Tanaka-san uses the vendor branch for all releases/patches which is another 
approach.

Importing what you get from anoncvs in your repository is more or less the
only way to do that.

The way I generally use anoncvs, is that I modify the source locally, make
a 'cvs diff' and it.
