put the following into a file and run it "zsh scriptname"

while :; do=20
   echo helu
   sleep 1
done


run that script, hit ^Z, and then put into foreground again.. why does it
exit the while loop (thus causing the script to exit)?

This works fine in bash:

(~) % bash p
helu
helu

zsh: 28123 suspended  bash p
(~) % fg
[3]    continued  bash p
helu
helu


but in zsh:

(~) % zsh p=20
helu
helu

zsh: 28129 suspended  zsh p
(~) % fg
[3]    continued  zsh p
(~) % echo $?
0



--=20
