hi, i've just found that zsh doesn't complete it's own switches:

roman@freepuppy ~ 104:0 > zsh -^I     -> nothing
roman@freepuppy ~ 104:0 > zsh --help  -> lots of info

this is quite surprising given it otherwise completes even stuff i
wouldn't expect it to (i've grown a habit of hitting tab just about
everywhere :)

is this planned for 4.1.x or 4.0.5 perhaps? does anyone have a function
for this? i've tried to look around the web, but it's kinda hard to come
up with the right query: "zsh compinit" isn't all that specific :)

no a related note: i don't get completion for scp and ssh command lines.
i *think* it worked on one of my previous installs. do i smoke too much,
or is something screwed with this zsh?

it's 4.0.4 from the port (similar to srpm for the linuxers among you)
