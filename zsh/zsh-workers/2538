May I express the hope for a stable 'last' version without modules to 
come FIRST, before we might try the modules ???

I personally can live with the bugs of 3.0.1 for a while, but the users
around here often are complaining and I would appreciate NOT to go back 
to older ZSH's (mostly because of the scripts being already adapted to
the '~1 ... ~n' instead of '=1 ... =n' dirstacks).

So is there either a list (and order) of patches to get a stable version?
Or a kind of last, patched, 'state of the art - before modules' Version?
