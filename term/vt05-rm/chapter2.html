<H1 ID="S2">Chapter 2<BR>Functional Description</H1>
<P>Basically, the VT05 system consists of a keyboard, CRT display, transmit/receive logic, control logic,
main memory, character generator/ROM and power supply (see <A HREF="chapter1.html#F1-2">Figure 1-2</A>).</P>
<P>The keyboard transmits an ASCII code directly to the computer each time a key is depressed, and the
computer, in turn, transmits the character code to the VT05 control logic. The control logic determines
if the received data is to be displayed or used to control the displayed text format. The information
or data is sequentially read out of the main memory and applied to the character generator
read-only memory (ROM), where the character codes are converted to a 5 &times; 7 dot matrix and are subsequently
displayed as a character. The VT05 continually refreshes the information displayed on the
CRT at a constant 50 or 60 Hz rate.</P>
<H2 ID="S2.1">2.1 Keyboard</H2>
<P>The basic function of the keyboard (see <A HREF="#F2-1">Figure 2-1</A>) is to provide a convenient, on-line means of
transmitting U.S. ASCII characters to the processor to be processed and displayed on the VT05 CRT
display.</P>

<H2 ID="S2.2">2.2 CRT Display</H2>
<P>The VT05 display allows direct viewing of all displayable characters contained in the VT05 character
set that are transmitted from and/or received by the VT05. The display module is a raster-type (television)
display of characters as well as video pictures that originate from a closed-circuit television
source. CRT inputs that are applied to the read-only memory and used for character generation are
derived through the control logic. External video signals are input via a BNC connector located on
the rear panel of the VT05. Displayed text is constantly refreshed by the VT05 recirculating memory.</P>
<P>The VT05 can display up to 20 character lines, 72 characters per line, or a maximum of 1440 characters,
full-screen. A line feed with the cursor in the bottom line (line 20) will cause the display to
"scroll" or move each line up one line position, the top line (previously line 1) will scroll off the display
area, and the text contained within that line will be erased from the display refresh memory.
A blinking cursor is used to indicate the position of the next character to be generated. The cursor
can be moved up, down, left, or right through the use of various control characters; it also moves to
the right automatically as it receives each new character.</P>
<H2 ID="S2.3">2.3 Transmit/Receive Logic</H2>
<P>The basic function of the VT05 transmit/receive logic is to provide parallel-to-serial (output) and
serial-to-parallel (input) conversion, special character decoding, and input/output synchronization.</P>
<H2 ID="S2.4">2.4 Control Logic</H2>
<P>The VT05 control logic provides overall system control, basic timing, and monitoring of input data for
control functions such as carriage return, line feed, backspace, move cursor, etc.</P>
<H2 ID="S2.5">2.5 Recirculating Memory</H2>
<P>The VT05 memory consists of several MOS dynamic shift registers that are organized bit-parallel and
character-serial. Memory capacity is 9816 bits. The function of the recirculating memory is to store
received data and to continually refresh the VT05 CRT display by addressing the character generator/ROM.</P>
<H2 ID="S2.6">2.6 Read-Only Memory/Character Generator</H2>
<P>The read-only memory/character generator has a 2240-bit capacity and is capable of generating any
of the VT05 displayable ASCII characters. Character codes are continuously received by the ROM
from the recirculating memory; the ROM then converts each code into a 5 &times; 7 dot matrix that is output
to be displayed as a character on the CRT display screen. Any lower case codes that are received will
be converted to upper case, stored, and then displayed by the terminal as upper case characters. The
DEL (rubout) 177<SUB>8</SUB> code is ignored and no visual indication occurs on the display when this code is received.
The complete VT05 displayed character set consists of 26 upper case alphabetical characters,
10 numerals, and 27 symbols as listed in <A HREF="chapter1.html#T1-3">Table 1-3</A>.</P>
<H2 ID="S2.7">2.7 Filler Characters Required at High Baud Rates</H2>
<P>At speeds above 300 baud, filler characters (or time delay) are required after many of the control characters
transmitted to a VT05-B.</P>
<P>Characters Requiring Fillers Above 300 Baud:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Line Feed</LI>
<LI>Cursor Down</LI>
<LI>HOME</LI>
<LI>Cursor Up</LI>
<LI>Erase Screen</LI>
<LI>Cursor Y Address</LI>
</UL>
<P>Filler characters should be null (0000000) as a rule, though other characters may be satisfactory if
direct cursor addressing is not used. (Fillers after Cursor Y Address must be null to be interpreted correctly.)</P>
<P>Delay required is slightly greater than one full cycle of the AC line. At both 50&nbsp;Hz and 60&nbsp;Hz, the
number of fillers required to accomplish this is:</P>
