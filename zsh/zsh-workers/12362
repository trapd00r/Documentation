In this case I want to list all files that start with `*' :-))) I expect
from completion to list *real* arguments. It is the same as listing
shell functions as possible command completion after sudo. Yes, I
requested completion - but I never requested to ignore noglob. Exaclty,
because I used it, completion system *must* think I know what I'm doing.

I think, it is a matter of personal preference ... what about - first
try with noglob respected, second not (something in the line with
fignore or ingnored-patterns). With two different tags for both? That is
probably not so easy I'm afraid.
