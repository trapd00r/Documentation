Sure.  I must admit, I was thinking of the programmable ones, but you're quite 
right.

Wouldn't this be a bit clunky with programmable completion?  Surely if I'm 
using a function to generate completions (a list of jobs, or a list of 
suitable hostnames or whatever) then it would be natural to explain them 
there?  Am I misunderstanding something; I confess it feels a bit yucky to 
have two places where descriptions come from?
