It's currently impossible to do this properly since there's no way of
changing the `interactive' option.  In principle, you could move the
setting of the interactive option into the code I just adapted to be
run both when the shell starts up and after `exec <...', which already
checks for a tty.  You probably have to wait a bit for that code to
show up.
