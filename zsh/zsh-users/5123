} is there still widespread opposition to closing this list to non-members

I don't think that's the solution, at least for viruses.  The virus
that started this particular thread mails itself to address book entries
while using other address book entries to forge the From: header.  That
makes it reasonably likely that either the sender is a subscriber, or
would appear to be one unless the SMTP envelope were examined by the list
software.

The list is run with ezmlm, which implies qmail; it ought to be possible
to plug in some kind of a virus filter with qmail-scanner.
