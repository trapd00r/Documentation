The my-accounts tag is only used when _combination looks up the
users-hosts style and not ever with _tags (users, hosts etc are used
there) so it can't be used with tag-order.

There are a number of things about _combination that I'm not entirely
happy with. I have ideas and some semi-working code that I'll hopefully
get around to finishing sometime.

I'll pass on the main part of your question until I've had a chance to
play with a running zsh.
