As far as I understand the info file, I think it just prints what you
have to do in a startup script to bind the alias (or every alias in
the current shell, if no argument is given) the same way it is in the
current shell.

For example :
$ alias foo=bar
$ alias foo
foo=bar
$ alias -L foo
alias foo=bar
$ alias -g foo=bar
$ alias \foo
foo=bar
$ alias -L \foo
alias -g foo=bar
$

See ? It prints what you should put in, say, .zshrc to have the
current behaviour of this alias.
