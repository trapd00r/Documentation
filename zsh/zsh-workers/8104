If I understand you correctly, then yes, there's a function called
incremental-complete-word, which has this near its start:

  # This allows incremental completion of a word.  After starting this
  # command, a list of completion choices can be shown after every character
  # you type, which you can delete with ^h or DEL.  RET will accept the
  # completion so far.  You can hit TAB to do normal completion, ^g to
  # abort back to the state when you started, and ^d to list the matches.

although it has a few things which I think could be improved upon
(this is next on my to-do list, in fact :-)

Presumably you'd want to tell it complete words from the history.  I
don't know when it first appeared, but you're best off using it with
the latest development versions: 3.1.6 and later.
