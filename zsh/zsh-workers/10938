Subject: Lots of flickering in menu-selection, and a send-break problem
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

It goes by too fast for me to see what's really happening, but try this.

Start a menu selection with a large number of completions, enough to fill
most of the screen or even to require scrolling.

Now hit ESC-x to invoke execute-named-command.

Now abort that with C-g (send-break).

You get a bunch of flickering and then you're thrown back to the PS1 prompt
with the current command aborted.  Ick!  I just wanted to get out of the
execute: prompt, not blow away the whole command line.

You get similar flickering if you abort out of a scrolling menu-selection
with C-u (kill-whole-line).  I don't see the flicker when not scrolling.
