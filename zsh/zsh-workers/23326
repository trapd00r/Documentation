Hi,

If I get the current HEAD source then it won't build for me by default,
as I didn't let it know where iconv was and there's a point in the code
which assumes that if you HAVE_NL_LANGINFO and CODESET then you can use
a variable, count, which only exists if you HAVE_ICONV.

No idea whether or not this is a logically correct fix, but it does let
the code compile and run.
