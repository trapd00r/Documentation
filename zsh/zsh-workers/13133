I had not much time recently. Casual test shows, that zpty is currently
completely broken on current Cygwin (1.1.5-4 as of this writing); I do not
claim that it is zsh problem, but recent changes may have made it worse.

About select - so far there seems to be no known problems under cygwin (that
does not mean, there are no problems).
