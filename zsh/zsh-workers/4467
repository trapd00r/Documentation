I've just looked at the 3.1.5 release notes and didn't find any trace of
the compctl patch from Sven Wischnowsky. Was it incorporated or not ?

With his help, I have a patch to 3.1.4 that implement his changes but I'm
afraid it will conflict with some 3.1.5 changes...

I just tested the patch, it fails at 3 hunks but the rejected ones are
somewhat big...

Thanks for any help (and remember I'm not on the list so Cc: me please).
