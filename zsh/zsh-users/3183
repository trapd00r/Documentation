I was using 3.0.7 on a FreeBSD 4.0-STABLE machine but
upgraded to the devel version (3.1.9) and things worked
great... weird. Only little question I have now is what
value do you give LOGCHECK to print who's logged on when the 
shell first starts? I was a mostly tcsh user up until a few
days ago when I realized zsh is superior ;-) and the
functionality I want to duplicate is tcsh's set
watch=(any any) which prints the "who's logged on
message" when the shell starts.

=>WATCH=all and watch=all work for me.  What version are you using?
