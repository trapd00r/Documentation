Well, this awk doesn't have a lot of keywords.  The closest relevant thing  
from the manpage is:

     Files are read in order; if there are no files, the standard
     input is read.  The file name `-' means the standard input.
     Each line is matched against the pattern portion of every
     pattern-action statement; the associated action is performed
     for each matched pattern.

And here is what I have taken to be the complete list of functions:

     The print statement prints its arguments on the standard
     output (or on a file if >file is present), separated by the
     current output field separator, and terminated by the output
     record separator.  The printf statement formats its expres-
     sion list according to the format (see printf(3S)).

     The built-in function length returns the length of its argu-
     ment taken as a string, or of the whole line if no argument.
     There are also built-in functions exp, log, sqrt, and int.
     The last truncates its argument to an integer.
     substr(s, m, n) returns the n-character substring of s that
     begins at position m.  The function
     sprintf(fmt, expr, expr, ...) formats the expressions
     according to the printf(3S) format given by fmt and returns
     the resulting string.


I assume it matches the spec in the reference below:
