You're right, I missed that last step, there is indeed stuff in tmp1
including the correct completion.

It may even have briefly worked when -U was passed to all relevant
compadds in _path_files, but we've now restricted it to approximation.
I can't remember why, but I seem to remember it was something which
should in principle have worked but no one understood what the internals
were doing.

Something clever with prefixes might fix it, only I don't know
what.  There are two problems:  first check that something needs
expanding, next do it safely.
