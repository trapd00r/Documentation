Bart asked the same lately. As far as I can remember, the only
difference between `compctl -g "*(-/)"' and `compctl -/' was the
handling of directory names starting with a dot. And _path_files
should handle that correctly.

If you could tell me other differences or if you know how _path_files
behaves differently, please tell me.


Bye
