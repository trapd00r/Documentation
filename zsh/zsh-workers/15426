My only problem with that is that there may be cases where we have more
than two matches with the same description, something like:

--foo          --Foo  --fOO  -- turn on fooing
--long-option                -- turn on longing

If that gets out of hand... But then I don't know how often this will
happen at all.

I think you have seen from the discussion that I'm not happy about it,
too.  One thing we could do is allow users to de-select the long/short
form as has been suggested (there is a slight problem with
auto-descriptions, btw).

The other is to try to implement what you and we prefer anyway:

Really that or: 

    --binary                 [-b] -- Unix line endings LF

?

Same here.

I have some ideas how we could achive this, part of the stuff we need is
already there.  Think of some combination of list-packed, list-rows-first
and `dummy' matches that get slots in the listing but show nothing and
can't be selected.  We'll have to find a way to make this easy to select
and handle.  I'll think about this at the weekend.


What are we coming to... ;-)


Bye
