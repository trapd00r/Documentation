Thanks!

A minor quibble is that the default is set in a way that will likely
cause confusion and the learning zsh-specific remedy . Are most of the
zsh defaults set so that they are compatible with ksh88 and bash 2.05a
and before?

If there is someone out there that has a program that requires trap
DEBUG to run afterwards I'd be interested in hearing.

Am having other problems with trap DEBUG and something causing an exit
condition without any sort of error indicating the why the exit is
raised and although I know probably where it is raised, I can't figure
out why it should be raised. However I've not been able to get a
simple example that shows the problem yet.
