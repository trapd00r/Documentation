% ls pkgs/**/man(/) 

	will find _all_ directories named man below the pkgs
directory, but will _not_ follow symlinks.  (to do that, you
would do `ls pkgs/***/man(/)' instead.)  if you want to limit
your search to man directories one level deep (either so as
to not list subsequent ones, or to not waste time searching
large subdirectories that you aren't interested in), you're
probably better off using find, or some kludge like

% ls $( ls -d test/*(@) )/man(/)
