Ok, I wasn't aware of the possibilities of *newer versions* of GNU
a2ps. So I change my statement to: I'm very much against completing
all files unconditionally. We should do that only if the a2ps is a
newer GNU version that supports automatic conversion and whatnot. Ok?

My a2ps (4.10.1) at least produces only pages containing the
PostScript code for PostScript files. And since only few people will
probably want that, I still think PostScript files shouldn't be
completed for such a version by default.

But I'd like to hear other people's opinion, since, of course, I can
easily add the ignored-patterns stuff to my setup if everyone else
thinks that the default should be changed.


Bye
 Sven
