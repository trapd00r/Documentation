I put the final version of zsh-3.0.4 onto ftp://ftp.cs.elte.hu/pub/zsh/.
Note that it is not the same as the zsh-3.0.4 patch I posted earlier to
the list for testing.

The files are (time is in GMT+2):

     8018 Jun 23 07:11 zsh-3.0.4.diff.gz
   652098 Jun 23 07:21 zsh-3.0.4.tar.gz

The real announcement on zsh-announce and on some newsgroups will come
tomorrow.

Zoltan
