Hi, here is what I do to achieve what you want.

I bound history-beginning-search-forward to F2 and
history-beginning-search-backward to F3.

Then, when I type a command that I want to recall from history, I simply
type enough to match the history (usually just the command without any
parameters) then press F2 or F3 to cycle through all the history matches
for that command.

Example.
$ somecom<F2> matches
$ somecommand -with -fancy /options/and/a/long/path

but the cursor stays in place and you can press F2 again and it will
match:
$ somecommand -with -more -fancy /options/and/another/long/path
and so on...

I read about it a while back on this list and it has changed my life.
:-)


Darren.
