Dear Zsh workers:
	I'm a newcomer of Zshell.
	I encounter a problem when I use Zshell
	when I use the following alias:
	alias fn='find . -name ''*''\!:1''*'' -print'
	and try "fn cshrc" for a test,
	I receive the error message:
	"find: missing conjunction"
	What can I do ?
	  Thanks a lot! 
						Zhou
