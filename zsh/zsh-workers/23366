Oh good, it's not just me then.  I had similar thoughts.

Thanks, but I feel more comfortable having someone else preview the
stuff before it gets committed, to catch the most obvious stuff.
$employer uses a formal code-review process integrated into the commit
hooks for Perforce and it works well enough that I wish other places had
it ... the zsh sourceforge page suggests that the patch tracking system
isn't much used.

Perhaps if I keep up the interest in zsh internals and learn enough to
be safe.
