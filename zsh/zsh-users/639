But yodl is an attempt to bring order to this mess.  We've been
searching for some time for a set of tools and meta-document format
that would allow us to generate all the formats necessary, while
maintaining only one document base.  I researched the problem
when I was maintainer of zsh, but I couldn't find a solid (and
free) solution.  Yodl is fairly new, but appears to be the best
solution so far.
