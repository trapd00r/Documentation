Finally got a chance to apply this patch and try it.  Looks good.

Correct; I'm sorry.

Yes, I concur.  What I can't figure out is why they need to be incremented
at all?  Why not just assign them the do-not-close value to begin with?
Something having to do with them persisting for only one command?

Appended is a suggested test entry.  While writing this, I noticed that
the first process substitution test relies on the 'cut' and 'paste'
external commands.  I guess there's never been a problem with that, but
I wasn't aware they were both supported on all platforms where zsh has
been compiled.
