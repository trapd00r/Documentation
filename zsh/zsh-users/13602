Hi all,

I want to offer users of my RC files a short overview of what
they can do with <Ctrl-E foo>. Ideally, I would want to

  bindkey '^E' binding_overview
  bindkey '^Ee' push_line
  bindkey '^Ei' insert-unicode-char

etc etc. Of course, I could make the binding_overview
widget accept a letter and emulate 'proper' keybindings,
but I would prefer a solution within the shell.
Reading the docs does not make me think it's likely
that something like this exists, but I though it would
not hurt to ask, either.


Richard
