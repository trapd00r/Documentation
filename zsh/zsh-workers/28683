I realise, that's not set in stone yet. But we could move at a point of
our choice before we may be forced to do it some time in the future.

I believe, moving to git would make sense, since we already got a synced
mirror of the CVS repository (thanks to Wayne). Git being a distributed
VCS would obviously eliminate the single-point-of-failure weakness of
systems such as CVS or SVN. Another benefit of using git would be, that
you could verify that the history of a remote repository is exactly the
same as the one on your local machine by just comparing the hash-sum of
a commit in question.

Also, if a "central" git repository went down, we could just set up
another "central" one somewhere else from a local one, since the central
and the local one are virtually the same.


To cut a long story short: If we'd be forced to move away from CVS, I
think git makes a lot more sense than SVN (which wouldn't solve the
problem we're having right now).

Regards, Frank
