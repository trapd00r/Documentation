This fixes that, but unfortunately invalidates Bart's previous assumption
that a TCP session would always have a valid fd number.  Given the comment
in the second hunk, I don't see an alternative, does anyone?

The test
  (fileno(zfsess->cin) == zfsess->control->fd)
is the most dire and unjustifiable paranoia.
