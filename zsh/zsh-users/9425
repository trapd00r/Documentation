} Could this be a bug?

The ulimit builtin comes from the rlimits module.  Modules are not
automatically loaded when zsh runs as "sh", to avoid polluting the
variable namespaces or replacing external commands with builtins.

Whether it's noncompliant from a POSIX point of view that "ulimit"
is not a "normal" builtin, I don't know.  (I ought to bookmark the
spec one of these days ...)
