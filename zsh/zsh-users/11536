Subject: A conditional test to see whether a function is loaded?

Hi everyone:

I want to write a shell script that (among other things) tests to see  
if a function foo is loaded.

Is there something analogous to  [[ -x $(which foo) ]] that would  
test specifically for a loaded function, or an autoloadable function,  
rather than an executable file?

Thanks.

Bill
