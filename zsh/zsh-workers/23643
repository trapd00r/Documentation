This sounds like the normal zsh behavior for ignored files; e.g:

zsh -f
fignore=(.old)
touch foo foobar.old

ls fo<TAB> completes "foo"

ls foob<TAB> completes "foobar.old" (since there are no non-ignored
completions that are possible)

If it is possible to change this behavior, I don't know about how.
Anyone else know?
