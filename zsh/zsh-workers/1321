} I thought you got this behaviour only by turning on shwordsplit?

Probably that was true at one time.

In any case, it would be nice to be able to get a Bourne-shell-compatible
"test" as well as a POSIX-compatible "test".  As demonstrated here before,
bash appears to use the POSIX semantics, but sh and ksh use the "argument
expected" semantics quoted above.
