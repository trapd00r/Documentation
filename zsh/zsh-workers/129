Ah...I definitaly agree with you, this got me to finally track down the
change, this works for me:

*** init.c.bak	Fri Jun 30 10:18:35 1995
--- init.c	Fri Jun 30 10:18:49 1995
***************
*** 513,519 ****
  	else
  	    logname = ztrdup("");
      }
!     username = ztrdup(logname);
  
      /* Try a cheap test to see if we can *
       * initialize $PWD from $HOME        */
--- 513,519 ----
  	else
  	    logname = ztrdup("");
      }
!     username = ztrdup(pswd->pw_name);
  
      /* Try a cheap test to see if we can *
       * initialize $PWD from $HOME        */

Much better...thanks for complaining :)
