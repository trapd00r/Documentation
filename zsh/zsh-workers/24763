Nice, I've wanted this on several occasions. Especially since
sometimes my chpwd function breaks constructs like (cd /foo; tar c .)
| tar x. I worked around that by printing everything to stderr instead
but it seems icky.

Also, I realized I didn't know what the existing options -sLP did, so
I looked at the manpage and
1) there's a typo near the beginning
Otherwise, if var(arg) begins with a slash, attempt to change to the
director<missing a y here> given by var(arg).
2)
    If the -P option is given or the CHASE_LINKS option is set,
symbolic links are resolved to their true  values.   If the -L option
is given symbolic links are followed regardless of the state of the
CHASE_LINKS option.
Intuitively this paragraph doesn't make any sense. Both options seem
to do the same thing? (-P || CHASE_LINKS) || -L == -P || -L ||
CHASE_LINKS
