No problem with bash.

It works with Mutt, less and emacs. But well, zsh doesn't say that it is
incorrect; it says that it can't find the termcap info.

BTW, I added the following lines in terminfo.src (distributed with
ncurses), after the rxvt entry:

nettle|nettle terminal emulator (RISC OS), 
	rmkx=, smkx=, use=rxvt, 

then reinstalled the terminfo and termcap databases in my $HOME.

No problem with bash (I don't even need to set TERMINFO).

The archives say to use the TERMCAP variable. But here it closes
the connection!
