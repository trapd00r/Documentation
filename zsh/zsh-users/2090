Hello,

I have a directory that looks like this:

%  ls -1 pkgs
./
../
gcc@
gcc-2.8.1/
perl@
perl-5.00502/
vim@
vim-5.4d/
zsh@
zsh-3.1.5/
...

In other words, there is a directory that contains a specific
package (ie. zsh-3.1.5) and a simplified link to that directory
(ie. zsh).

Question:  I am trying to locate all directories called "man" one
level deep, ie:

% ls pkgs/*/man

will do it.  The trouble is, some of these are redundant (like
zsh-3.1.5/man and zsh/man).  Is there a way to only specify the
links (or non-links) in the glob?  Something like

% ls pkgs/*(@)/man

The above doesn't work but is there something similar that will?

Thanks,

Steve
