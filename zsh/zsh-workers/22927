The basic behaviour of _files is just to add the filenames as strings.
There is additional behaviour (showing types, etc.), but it relies on
being able to find the file added.  If the completion system doesn't
find the file it will just fall back to treating it like an ordinary
string.  In this case, it actually will find the file; but all that's
likely to happen is a few extra things show up.  The most distracting
possibility is if you're using the file-list style I added.  Then you
might see long listings of the file in that directory.  Outside listings,
however, you shouldn't see any problems.
