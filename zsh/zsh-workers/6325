Dwight Lee posted this to comp.sys.next.* newsgroups (incorrectly  
crossposting to csn.misc, but that's another story ;-)

I thought it likely that few folks on this list would see it so I repost it  
here with followups to 'dwight_lee@fortdearborn.com'

NOTE: "MOSXS" stands for "Mac OS X Server"

As a faithful zsh user, I of course set myself up on Mac OS X Server
with zsh, but found that my preferred options weren't sticking.
Specifically, autolist (aka AUTO_LIST) doesn't show up in a plain
"setopt", and it's not the default.  I compiled my own copy of zsh
3.1.5 and the same thing happened.

Oddly, if I pick another option, like autocd, it's fine.

Is this a zsh problem or a MOSXS problem?
