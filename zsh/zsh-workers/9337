I'm really, really against this change. 

After all, we use _files to be able to 1) restrict the types of files
matched to some sensible subset and to 2) still be able to complete
other files as a default. And since in many (I think: most) cases one
won't want to a2ps postscript files, we should definitely keep the old 
form.

*And* for exactly this kind of stuff we added the tags mechanism,
dammit. So, if RTM isn't clear, someone should document (at the top of 
_a2ps?) that one can easily say that one wants to complete all files
for a2ps (or any other command) by just saying:

  zstyle ':completion:*::a2ps:*' tag-order all-files


Bye
 Sven
