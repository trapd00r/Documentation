It's documented in the ARITHMETIC EVALUATION manual entry in zshmisc,
but fairly well down, so I don't suppose most people have read that far.
I expect the structure of the entry could be improved.

       If a variable is first assigned in a numeric context without previously
       being declared, it will be implicitly typed as  integer  or  float  and
       retain  that  type either until the type is explicitly changed or until
       the end of the scope.

The corollary is that if you always explicitly say "typeset x" before x
is ever used the variable will stay as a scalar.
