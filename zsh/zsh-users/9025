Bart,
I may combine your script with that of Phillipe as Select had two disadvantages in this case (it
uses numerics, whereas I'd prefer the menonmic v for vi c for cp m for mv etc, also because select
automatically repeats on an empty return, whereas I want it to goto next. Nevertheless your script
is a mini-tutorial in scripting
