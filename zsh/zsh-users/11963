That shouldn't be a problem. (+cyg.om[1]), (.om[1]+cyg), (e:cyg:.om[1]),
(.om[1]+cyg) should all work.  It's the standard modifier syntax, so you
can use multiple sets of parentheses if you have EXTENDED_GLOB set and
you put #1 at the start of each: (#qom[1])(#q+cyg).  The only problem I
can see with the code is if you try to apply more than one
transformation by that mechanism, since it keeps the last one.
