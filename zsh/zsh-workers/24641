Thanks, but the PATH and : issue was just an example. The same problem
happens with

program --file=/us<TAB>

and in other cases. zsh does not seem to take anything but whitespace as a
word boundary except for special cases such as variable assignment (e.g.
PATH=/us<TAB> works). I really want to fix this for good, but I don't feel
like digging through the complete source, so I'll need at least some
directions.
