It shouldn't be possible to get this error message unless the job table
has grown to a really silly size, indicating another problem.  I can't
see anything just by using your precmd and preexec and repeatedly
executing commands, but maybe there is some kind of race.

If you want to debug it, you could run gdb on zsh and set a break point
inside the function zfork() in exec.c where it it outputs the error
message you're seeing.  Then look at the variables maxjob, jobtabsize,
and if maxjob is large, the values of some entries of the table e.g.
jobtab[maxjob-1], jobtab[maxjob-2], ...

If you can get any more info, thanks.
