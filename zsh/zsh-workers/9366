Subject: Problem with history special parameter
Date: Wed, 19 Jan 2000 12:48:55 +0000
From: Peter Stephenson <pws@pwstephenson.fsnet.co.uk>
Message-Id: <E12AuUY-00031L-00.2000-01-19-12-45-42@cmailg5.svr.pol.co.uk>

The first time I print out the keys to the history associative array (print
${(k)history}) I get:

%s.LOCK %s.LOCK %s.LOCK %s.LOCK %s.LOCK %s.LOCK %s.LOCK %s.LOCK %s.LOCK %s.LOCK

for all elements.  The second time I just get a blank.

This is with zsh/parameter loaded, obviously.
