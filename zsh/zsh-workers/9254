Subject: _a2ps & _arguments

I've just installed the GNU version of a2ps and I'm getting dreck from
_arguments when _a2ps is called, e.g.

_arguments:255: command not found: (ps|eps)
_arguments:256: command not found: _
_arguments:255: command not found: (ps|eps)
_arguments:256: command not found: _
_arguments:255: command not found: (ps|eps)
_arguments:256: command not found: _
_arguments:255: command not found: (ps|eps)
_arguments:256: command not found: _

I don't know if this is _a2ps or maybe the latest changes to evals in
_arguments.

I suppose if I want _a2ps to understand short options I should write it
myself.
