Changes were made since 4.0.2 and since 4.1.0-dev-2 to fix the
problems. In this case, it needed to use the -Wl,-x option to ld
instead of -s.

Peter has just made 4.0.3 available so it is on ftp.zsh.org. If you
could check that on MacOS X, that would be very useful. It also will
contain the documentation so you won't have the problems with yodl
which you had with the snapshots.

Yes, their documentation was invaluable in getting zsh working with the
dlcompat library.

Anyway, if you still get the libm related errors with 4.0.3 then I'll
worry about it then. What version of MacOS X have you got?
