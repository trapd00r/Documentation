Also, getaddrinfo() is required by SUSv3, whereas
gethostbyaddr/gethostbyname are deprecated, and
getipnodebyname/getipnodebyaddr aren't even mentioned.
Since that obviously has no practical merit, getaddrinfo()
facilitates support of IPv6.  In addition, with the patch applied,
there're more places that accept service names in lieu of TCP port
numbers.  Nothing that couldn't be achieved by other methods and a great
deal more difficulty.

I imagine that simplified compatibility functions should be relatively
easy, however.
