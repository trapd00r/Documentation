} I can't reproduce this with 3.1.6++. An exact recipe and a stack trace 
} of a debugging-compiled shell (so that we can find out which strlen()
} is called with a zero argument) would be helpful.

possible that you're causing zsh to index into a null part of the sigmsg[]
array when it's printing the reason for the core dump.
