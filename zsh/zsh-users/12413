} So if I want zsh to run for non-interactive shells, how would I do that?

It may not be possible.

} Putting
}  exec zsh -$- "$@"
} into .bashrc only leads to:
} 
}  lama:~>scp admin@otherhost:/etc/passwd .
}  zsh: string expected after -c

That indicates that the command passed to "sh -c ..." is not available
to be passed along to the new shell that's exec'd.  Which makes sense
now that I think about it, because "$@" will be any additional args
that came after the command for -c.
