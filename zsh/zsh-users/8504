(  2005-02-14 11:38:28 - Project CVS Service )   As of 2005-02-09 there
was an outage of anonymous CVS (tarballs, pserver-based CVS and ViewCVS)
for projects whose UNIX names start with the letters m, n, p, q, t, y
and z. This problem has since been resolved and the normal 5 hour sync
delay will resume shortly.


It doesn't look fixed to me.
