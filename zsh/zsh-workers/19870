Just following up with a status report.  I did further testing, running the
FreeBSD boot and shutdown scripts and, so far as I can tell, everything is
working great as a plug in replacement for /bin/sh now.  Nice work!

The only minor thing I noticed is some warnings I get when I compile:

parameter.c: In function `scanpmparameters':
parameter.c:191: warning: dereferencing type-punned pointer will break strict-aliasing rules
parameter.c: In function `scanpmcommands':
parameter.c:330: warning: dereferencing type-punned pointer will break strict-aliasing rules

...etc, etc.


I saw in the list archive, that you discussed this back in February.  I did
not know the status of it so I thought I would mention it in case you were
unaware these warnings were still being produced under FreeBSD.  I am
compiling with gcc-3.2.2.

Thanks again, Peter, for quickly addressing the FreeBSD sh compatibility
signal issue.

Best regards,
Vincent
