I'm afraid that's proably a fatal flaw with this, nice as it would be.
If you have an emulate zsh-X, people are going to assume it does what
its name suggest, rather than just change the options.  Probably a
clear list of changes in default options, maybe in the documentation
as well as the news file so that it's available to users on most
right-thinking systems, would be enough --- people just want to set
them once in their .zshrc.  Then we can avoid *too* many messages
demonstrating passionate attachment to options...
