That's from >(echo|cat) which is getting parsed in some strange way.  It
shouldn't be being substituted at all.  I'll have to track that down.

Possibly, although you could also argue that if the contents look like
anything other than < followed by something that expands to a string it
should do that.  It depends what you mean by "look like".  You need to
quote metacharacters to be sure of getting a file name in general, of
course.

Not really.  Here it means something on the lines of "anything other than a
positional argument to a command or to array assignment".

The reason I suggested it should perhaps still be a parse error is mostly
for the case of >>(...).  This won't work either but might give a more
confusing error message or use a different fd or something.  The latter
might happen with the input form, in fact.
