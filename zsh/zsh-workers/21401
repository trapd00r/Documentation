Hi, I have a wishlist request for the tarball archive maintainer.
I think tarballs (zsh-4.2.5.tar.bz2, etc.) should have a permanent
filename once they are released, i.e., not have to wait for the
next version to be released for it to move to the permanent
old/zsh-4.2.5.tar.bz2 location.  One way to do this would be to
put zsh-4.2.5.tar.bz2 in old/ in the first place, and symlink to
the toplevel directory.

Thanks for listening, Karl.
