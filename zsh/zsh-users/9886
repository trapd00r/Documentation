(I meant to send this yesterday, but got sidetracked, so this is already
out of date.)

I uploaded 4.3.0-dev-3 to the pub/development directory of
ftp.zsh.org.  This fixes a few odd things in multibyte mode and there
are the usual completion function tweaks.  It's now possible to define a
ZLE hook function zle-keymap-select to run when $KEYMAP changes.  One
minor incompatibility is that the shell no longer sets HOME itself if it
wasn't in the environment (which it usually is).  [In the next version
we'll continue to set HOME unconditionally in native zsh emulation.]

It's probably in a pretty fit state to be released as 4.3.1 now.
