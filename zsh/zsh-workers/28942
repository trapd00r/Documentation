Subject: Feature request: tab completion for git tree paths
To: zsh-workers@zsh.org
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1

Hello,

I very handy feature of the git completion in bash[1] is that it can
complete tree paths, e.g. it can complete an expression like
"HEAD:path/to/file". Would it be possible to integrate this in the git
completion support for zsh? Or has it already been integrated, but my
version of zsh (4.3.10) lacks support for it?

On a related note, using bashcompinit as described in [1] doesn't seem
to enable completion of tree paths, any ideas why this doesn't work?

Bye,
Johannes
