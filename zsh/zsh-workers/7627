Hmm, after thinking some more, maybe the following is a neater fix than
7616?  I don't see why you should have to autoload any module just to unset
a parameter that hasn't yet been loaded, which is supposed to be what the
following prevents.  The (paramtab == realparamtab) test makes sure it only
does the short cut for top level parameters, where we know what
paramtab->getnode does; I just copied it from createparam(), where I
presume it has a similar function (don't load a parameter if you're only
about to hide it).
