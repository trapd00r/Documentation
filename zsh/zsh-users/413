I just started using color-ls with a color-xterm last month, and I'm
addicted to it now.

But now when I use tab compeltion in zsh for cd and ls it feels weak.

What I'd like is for:
	less d<tab>

to look exactly the same as:
	ls -d d*

Is it in theory possible to do the above with compctl? If not how
might we add it?

Zsh currently supports making the prompts bold, etc. Has anyone played
with trying to give them certain colors?

Color hungry,
