Subject: Problems with trap handling?
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

This may be related to my "infinite loop" report:

function tst() {
  trap return INT 
  read -q xx'?Type ^C here: '
  echo You should not see this.
}

Execute in 3.1.6-dev-16 and type ^C.  Note that you don't leave the "read"
prompt.  Type any plain character; now "read" returns, and the function
aborts as if interrupted.

This and the previous report are on Linux, RH5.2.
