zsh doesn't really control whether or not other commands produce output.

By default, without setting that option, zsh outputs a Carriage Return
at the start of a prompt; that's the CR of CRLF fame, which sends the
cursor position back to the start of the line.  End result is that
output gets overwritten so that you don't see it.
