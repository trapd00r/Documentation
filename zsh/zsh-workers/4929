Hello,

I'm a happy user of the zsh for quite a while. The more I am becoming
accustomed to it the more annoying it becomes to work with command
line utilities that do not have the full power of zsh. What I wonder
if someone has thought of building a gnu readline drop-in-replacement
library but with the bells and whistles provided by the zsh command
line editing?

Obviously things like expansions should then be programmable so that
eg $matr<Tab> in the perl data language shell can be made to return a
list of all the perl variables that start with "$matr" .
