} I don't have these problems under Solaris 8 if I compile with gcc 2.95.3
} or Forte C 6.1u1.  However, if I use Forte with -xtarget=ultra -xarch=v9
} (i.e., 64-bit), failures occur.

(Yow.  300K of trace output sent to zsh-users?  We're going to have a rash
of unsubscribes.)

It would appear that globbing and file redirection are failing, which is
a pretty sure sign that large file support is not working properly with
the 64-bit Forte compiler.  Can you figure out what we need to be passing
as a compiler argument that we aren't, or whatever?
