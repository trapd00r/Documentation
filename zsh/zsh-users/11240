### create some "xyz" file
$ touch {1..10}.xyz

### check that they're there, using a wildcard
$ ls  *xyz
0.xyz	1.xyz	10.xyz	2.xyz	3.xyz	4.xyz	5.xyz	6.xyz	7.xyz 
8.xyz	9.xyz

### create another file with a leading dash in the filename
$ touch ./-11.xyz

### check again, with a wildcard
$ ls  *xyz
ls: illegal option -- .
usage: ls [-ABCFGHILPRSTWZabcdfghiklmnopqrstuwx1] [file ...]

:::::::::::

should the shell protect expanded file names, as if they were entered in 
quotes?
