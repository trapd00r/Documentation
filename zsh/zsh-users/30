This looks like a classic case of the interpreter exec line being too
long! One of the sillier features of unix lookalikes.

There is usually a limit on how long the #! line can be, 32 characters
or so. The error message always complains it can't find the script
file, not the interpreter. You've passed the length limit. This is a
kernel problem, rather than zsh. :-)

Basically you're stuck. You need to put it in a directory with a
shorter pathname, or use /bin/sh as a bootstrap to run zsh, or run
your script as a zsh function instead.

Bummer eh?

Dave.
