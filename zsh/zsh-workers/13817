Subject: ZLE documentation
Date: Wed, 28 Mar 2001 15:42:26 +0100
From: Peter Stephenson <pws@csr.com>

I've just moved the documentation on ZLE builtins from the module
description into a section on builtins in the main ZLE documentation.  The
patch consists almost entirely of the same large chunk repeated twice, so I
haven't bothered posting it.  The only new bit is the header of the new
builtins section, which is as follows.

sect(Zle Builtins)
cindex(zle, builtin commands)
The ZLE module contains three related builtin commands. The tt(bindkey)
command manipulates keymaps and key bindings; the tt(vared) command invokes
ZLE on the value of a shell parameter; and the tt(zle) command manipulates
editing widgets and allows command line access to ZLE commands from within
shell functions.
