Unfortunately, this is decided very early in complete-word and the
like, before the completion code is called at all.

I never liked it myself... hm, since we can controll such things in
the completion system (even now, with the styles we have, namely
tag-order): should we change it so that we get this insert-tab-in-
column-one only when the completion code is *not* about to call a
completion widget? I.e., leave it as it was for compctl but allow
completion widgets to decide what they want to do.

 Sven
