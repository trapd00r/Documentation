Hi,
  I appreciate the safety feature of prompting the user
before letting him do an rm -fr foo/*, but I think it's a
bit incomplete, seeing as it let me do rm -fr / without
any complaint.  If possible, could you add something
to change that?  (I know it's somewhat of a pathological
case, but still...)

Thank you,
