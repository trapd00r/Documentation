To do this without extendedglob and backreferences is, I think, simpler:

	print Charge is ${(M)${(M)string%%<->%,*}##<->%}

This is (where <-> matches a string of digits):

	${(M)string%%<->%,*}	Longest suffix beginning with <->%
	${(M)...##<->%}		Longest prefix of that matching <->%

I'd only resort to backreferences when the substring to be extracted is
ambiguous (e.g. "... charging, 95%, charging at 17%, ...") or when
extracting multiple fields (e.g. both the battery number and the charge
percentage).
