That's a segfault; the kernel's then oopsing whilst trying to page in
memory to write the coredump; looks like a problem in the MMU logic for
the powerpc.

So, the problems are:

 * vlc is segfaulting when it receives SIGINT;

 * the powerpc Linux kernel has a bug whereby it's ending up not letting
   the parent wait on it (from what I understand of the details so far)
   in some cases, so it looks like the process isn't actually ending and
   transitioning to zombie status; it might be worth talking to the
   architecture maintainers for your distribution, to see about known
   issues; note that even init is unable to reclaim these processes;
   have you tried sending a SIGKILL to force-exit the vlc, to see if
   either zsh or init can reap the process then?

 * zsh is somehow tickling the kernel bug and it might be worth having
   configure logic to deal with this, even after the problem is fixed,
   once we know what it is that's tickling this.

My nasty suspicious mind thinks that special kernel logic for handling a
weird exit condition, and logging it, is less tested code that's already
doing something different to the default, so this is likely close to the
root cause; no powerpc available for me to test, though.

It seems unlikely that there'd be enough bugs to also have a zombie
contributing to load average, so I suspect that the process has not in
fact exited yet, it's still running, that's where the load comes from.
Does ps(1) actually show the 'Z' for zombie?
