Sorry, my description wasn't clear enough.  Here's an example:

I have a new prompt and want to execute "cat /foo/bar".  I remember
that I executed this command some days ago and thus type ^R to go
into history-incremental-search-backward mode.  Now the
"bck-i-search:" prompt appears.  There I type "cat /fo" and
"bck-i-search: cat /fo" turns into "failing bck-i-search: cat /fo"
because the command is (for whatever reasons) not in my history file.
Now I want to be able to abort the search while transfering "cat /fo"
from the search prompt to the normal command prompt in order to
complete it manually.

Regards, Georg
