I just reinstalled the latest HEAD branch from CVS, without
--enable-function-subdirs for the first time in quite a
while, and I notice that I'm getting three rather suspicious
looking files called Entries, Root, and Repository appearing
in $installed/share/zsh/4.1.0-dev-1/functions.  Repository
contains `zsh/Completion/Zsh'.  Anyone know which Makefile
needs twiddling to fix that?
