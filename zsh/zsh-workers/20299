Welcome back, Peter. :-)

The thing is, Perl has two kinds of "eval":

schaefer[676] perl <<\EOF
print __LINE__."\n";
eval 'print __LINE__."\n"';
eval { print __LINE__."\n"; };
EOF
1
1
3

The kind in braces, which gets precompiled, behaves differently than the 
kind in quotes.  Zsh only has the kind in quotes.
