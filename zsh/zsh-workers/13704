We could do them in sections.  There are obviously gaps, but doing them
this way makes it easier to reorder to something more rational when the
gaps (particularly in options and builtins) are filled a bit better.
(It also makes it easier to add an extra digit in one section if that every
becomes necessary, heaven forfend.)

Some of these could still be reordered.  For example, arith could be later
in section B and parameter could be earlier in section C.  We can't
completely get rid of the dependencies, so there's no point losing too much
sleep over it.
