Similarly, I want to be able to do:
% ssh some-host command-in-company-bin-dir -oPts |less
and not have to worry about paths.

So I use zshenv, since it's the only pair of files sourced to set
variables.

If I'm going to worry about things like gdb, then I'll wrap the $path
setting inside a $SHLVL test -- if $SHLVL is set and is greater than or
equal to 2, then, and only then, assume that $PATH has been set
appropriately on this host.

Would fail when invoking zsh from a bash shell, were it not that I tend
to "exec zsh", which doesn't increase $SHLVL.
