Okay, after having heard the answer that there is the possibility
to have colored completion, has anybody used it to create useful
completions with colors in them to share with us all?
There is not one example but the very easy to handle 
ZLS_COLOURS case for completing different kinds of files.
To me it still seems to be quite complex to say the least.

Okay, I try to be not so polite: :)
Should'nt there be an easier way than that approach?
