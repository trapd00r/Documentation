Hi all,

I'm having trouble completing stuff like ~username on
solaris 8.  It works for some users but for others Zsh
seems to want to usr their login shell as home dir:

-----
lewang % cd ~wmwong
lewang@verve | ~wmwong
wmwong % cd ~lewang
cd: no such file or directory: /usr/bin/kshg
Exit Status 1
lewang@verve | ~wmwong
wmwong %                         
----

everything works fine before I load compinit, and I
load it using the following:

autoload -U compinit
compinit

Thanks.  and ohh yeah, HAPPY (American) Thanks Giving!
-lw

p.s. I think this is a "named directory" completion. 
Please correct me if I'm wrong.
