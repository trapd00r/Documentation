I agree, which (jumping ahead) is why I do NOT agree with:

I would include harden, checkmail, mere, and definitely zed as "useful
functions which many people might want to use," but proto is marginal
(how many people code in C with exactly Paul Falstad's style?) and to
autoload all those those trivial one-liners is IMO a waste.

It's too big to reasonably put in compctl-examples and remains relevant
to anyone not using the new completion system.  (multicomp is like the
_path_files function; no real overlap with matching control AFAICT.)

Yes, you call promptnl from precmd.  I suppose it (or contrib.yo) should
say that, somewhere.

That's why there's a `?' at the end of my comment.  So, leave run-help
as it is.

I have no objection to moving this to Example.

This is also fine with me.

I'd actually rather split compctl-examples up into smaller files and put
them all in Functions/Compctl, but I suppose we're trying to discourage
use of compctl ...

The main thing I want to do with the example startup files is to add a
batch of comments, possibly in all-caps, telling system administrators
NOT to drop these files into /etc/z*.  And maybe even put a "return 0"
at the top of each file just in case some nimrod copies them to /etc/
without looking at them.
