It would be nice if this feature could be used to remove options that
are defined in the _rsync script but not in the --help output.  The
latest version of _rsync in CVS now defines all the options through the
latest 2.6.3 version, but if the user is running a patched up 2.5.5
(e.g. debian stable), it would be helpful to the user if all the 2.6.x
options were not completed.
