On my system (HP-UX 9.05), zsh breaks the tty settings of any
xterm run in the background.  Specifically, the number of rows
is wrong, which confuses programs like top and more.  (This is
listed as a known bug in the zsh 2.3.1 documentation.)  I've
tried 2.3.1, 2.5, and 2.6beta10, and all of them appear to
have the same problem.  Is there a version somewhere that is
known to work?

Thanks,
