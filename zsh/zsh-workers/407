Hi.

Guess I get to have the dummy of the month award. If it isn't going to be 
the dummy of the year award.

I should have read the manual better on the err_exit topic. Although it 
is not quite clear that the zsh is going to receive the signal. Maybe it 
does, and I wasn't awake... Sigh.

Sorry. I'll go and sit in a corner and sob my thumb....
