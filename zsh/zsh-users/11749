It seems to highlight the first letter of whatever you are searching for.
So, to solve the highlighting problem, don't search for anything longer than
one character.  :)

====================

it's GPL... you can fix that ;)

on top of ~my~ list of why it's so great is that text searches are case 
insensitive by default; and it's very highly configurable with a ~/.mostrc 
file. you can configure it so the <HOME> and <END> buttons do something 
intuitive.

on top of ~my~ list of bugs are the missing search highlight, as you 
mention; that searching hangs on bold text (have to hit the "n" key twice 
to move from bold text); and the percentage meter seems flaky on large 
amounts of data.
