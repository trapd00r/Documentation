I find it safer to actually try running `zsh --version' rather than
using -f and -x.  First, because `test -x' is not supported
everywhere.  Second, because `exec zsh' might fail badly if some
shared library is missing.

I have the following in my .tcshrc:

# ...
# skip remaining setup if not an interactive shell
if ($?USER == 0 || $?prompt == 0) exit
# ...
# Is there a working zsh in PATH?
(zsh --version) >&/dev/null && exec zsh
# Otherwise try know locations.
(/bin/zsh --version) >&/dev/null && exec /bin/zsh
(/usr/bin/zsh --version) >&/dev/null && exec /usr/bin/zsh

(obviously that would look better with SHELL and -l)
