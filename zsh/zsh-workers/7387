Subject: Ahem


Just had a look at the CONTRIBUTORS file for the first time...

...just to make sure that more native english speaking people find my
name hard to pronounce ;-)

And Peter's entry is thought as an example of British understatement,
right? (And should probably be the first one, considering the -pws-<-> 
releases without which we wouldn't have got so far.)

Bye
 Sven
