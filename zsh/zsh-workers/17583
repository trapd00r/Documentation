That all sounds good.

A couple of points which you may or may not have thought of.
Will there now be an easier way for precommand modifiers to take
options. We could particularly do with this for command where a couple
of the options (-v was it) should be accepted by the posix definition
but it would also be useful in a couple of other cases for bash/ksh
compatibility (exec perhaps). I forget what the problem was previously
with this.

We may need a bit of care over how `-' and `--' options are handled.
Taking Chet Ramey's recent message on -users, I was wondering whether
printf (to take a particular example but it may be applicable to others)
should ignore an initial `--' argument.
