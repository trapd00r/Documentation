You mean output everything remaining in the string as special codes
rather than real (multibyte) characters?  Yes, that would make sense.

Yes, and it's the only occurrence of wcswidth(), so it would make sense
to remove it.  This would make my patch for probing for wcswidth()
redundant.

I think it really needs the length of the string here.  The width
produced by wcs_nicechar() is a printing width, which isn't the same.
