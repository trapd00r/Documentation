I use zmv for this; it's distributed with the shell and documented in
zshcontrib, so see that for more information.

  autoload -U zmv
  zmv '(* *)' '${1// /_}'

This acts on all files in the current directory with at least one space
in the name (the first pattern---note the quotes).  The parenthesis can
be referred to in the second argument as $1.  The substitution does
basically what you did with the history, except that I replace the space
with a "_".  Obviously, you can turn this into a function.
