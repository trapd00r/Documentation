hi,
this morning when i wanted to log into my computer
with cvs-zsh, i got:
BUG: attempt to free already free storage
it was shouting over and over again like in a loop.
when i try to use control-c, i get:
some strange sign and parse error.
also my history says i have actually only 1 when i have
42208.

no idea what's causing this, i just wanted to tell you about
it.
        Matthias
