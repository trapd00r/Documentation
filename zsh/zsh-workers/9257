Completion for zmodload hasn't caught up with module hierarchies yet.  The
nicest way of doing this would be to use `_files -W module_path -g
"*.so"' to match the modules and subdirectories (tags permitting) --- but
then you need to strip the .so from the matches, and that appears to be
hard.  Any thoughts before I try and do it some less nice way?  Option to
transform the matches by a given parameter substitution in _path_files?
