} compstate[quote] and compstate[quoting] indicate if it is in `...` but
} how can it tell it's in $(...)?

Hmm, at the moment perhaps it doesn't, but it could look at $LBUFFER to
find out.

} The level of nesting would also be useful.

It should be easy to add a special parameter that gives the same info
as the %_ prompt expansion.  I tried ${(%):-%_} but (not surprisingly)
the parser stack isn't "live" during the execution of the completion
function.

} [...] it would be useful to have the backquote as a removable
} suffix because it is quicker to press space than backquote.

The problem is that you end up with too many layers of autoremovable
suffixes.  When completing a path name within backticks, you can't
get both the trailing / on a directory name and the trailing backtick.

} Also, without multios the closing
} bracket of $(<...) should always be completed.

It would have to be an autoremovable suffix, too; `echo $(<file wc)' is
a silly example of why.
