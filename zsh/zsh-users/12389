Hello

I'm used to the tcsh and now when testing zsh the first thing that I 
would like to customize is the way history works. I want to type one or 
two characters and then hit the up arrow and get the commands that 
starts with the two characters. At the moment I have the history in the 
order it was typed. Can it be done and how?

Thanks
/Leslie
