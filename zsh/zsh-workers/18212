GNU cpp 3.2 info says:

   * Identifiers that are not macros, which are all considered to be the
     number zero.  This allows you to write `#if MACRO' instead of
     `#ifdef MACRO', if you know that MACRO, when defined, will
     always have a nonzero value.  Function-like macros used
     without their function call parentheses are also treated as zero.

Seems that it's treating RLIMIT_AS and RLIMIT_RSS as
"identifiers", because they compare equally in the #if.
