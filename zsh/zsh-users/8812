Most likely it has nothing to do with zsh. Once we had the same problem
because one of the daemons (I think ident) was trying to connect back to
the machine where connection was coming from to find out username there.
And we had firewall that was blocking those connections. So, login had
to wait till that daemon gave up.

YMMV.
