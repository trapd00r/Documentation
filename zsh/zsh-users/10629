Usually it's just /etc/zshrc.  Has your zsh been compiled in such a way

Most likely the kde apps are being started by the window manager,
which is run by the login display manager before any interactive
shells are run.  Try moving the limit command to /etc/zsh/zshenv
(or /etc/zshenv).  If that doesn't work, maybe the display manager
isn't using zsh to launch the window manager, and you need to put
the limit commands in /etc/profile or some such.
