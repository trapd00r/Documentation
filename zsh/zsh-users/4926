Hi all,

i want to use dynamic titles with screen. That why's i want to do a
print before each command, like this :

mutt () {
        print -Pn "\e]0; Mutt\a"
        \mutt
}

when i do that, i still have the mutt's completion, but when i press
enter, the print are executed (and work with screen) but the zsh
session crash :(

I hope you can help me, bests regards
