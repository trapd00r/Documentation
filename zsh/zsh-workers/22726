rpmlint (RPM checker) used e.g. by Mandriva complaints about "executable 
script without sheebang". Here are the functions:

{pts/1}% find Completion Functions -type f -perm /111
Completion/X/Command/_kfmclient
Completion/Zsh/Command/_zed
Completion/Unix/Type/_mime_types
Completion/Unix/Command/_getent
Completion/Unix/Command/_cdrecord
Completion/Unix/Command/_chmod
Completion/Unix/Command/_mtools
Functions/Zle/zed-set-file-name
Functions/Zle/url-quote-magic
Functions/Misc/zed
Functions/Misc/mere
Functions/Misc/zcalc
Functions/Misc/run-help
Functions/Misc/harden

Any reason for them to have executable bit on? I do not think any of them is 
ever supposed to be run externally?
