Hi all,

I would like to add a zsh.spec.in file to the toplevel directory so
that any tarball releases or CVS snapshots can immediately be built
into RPMs with

  $ rpm -ta zsh-3.1.x-dev-y.tar.gz

Are there any objections to this?  If not there are a few issues to
clear up:

 - Do we also bundle a zsh.spec in releases?  I vote yes, otherwise
   the whole exercise is a bit pointless.

 - Should zsh.spec be included in the CVS tree?  Yes goes against the
   grain, since all other auto-generated files aren't, but no means
   that CVS snapshots can't be built immediately as above.

 - I would like to include some sample startup files for a typical
   RedHat box.  I already have these - taken from an official RedHat
   zsh rpm, and then much improved (mainly through suggestions from
   Bart).  Would it be OK to add these in a new StartupFiles/RedHat
   directory?  Or is it time that the current StartupFiles files
   (written for 2.7) got a rehaul anyway?

Adam
