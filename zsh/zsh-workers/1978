There are two problems with this.  Firstly, BSD_ECHO should have the
OPT_EMULATE flag, regardless of its default state.  Secondly, as I've
said before, it's a really bad idea to try to emulate the native sh --
on some OSes, such as the one I'm using here, the results of the
configure test depend on what the installer's $PATH is set to.  I
suggest you revert this patch for the final final 3.0 release, or at
least add the OPT_EMULATE flag to the second case.
