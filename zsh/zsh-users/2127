Still using zsh-3.1.4, this behaviour isn't there:

jean-luc@picard ~> echo $LOGNAME $USERNAME
jean-luc jean-luc
[su to root]
root@picard /home/jean-luc> echo $LOGNAME $USERNAME
jean-luc root

This is a Linux box (Linux 2.0.35, glibc)

Perhaps this hast changed in zsh-3.1.5 and someone forgot to update the
documentation :)
