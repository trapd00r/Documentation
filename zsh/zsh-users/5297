    This made me look in the uguide, and looks like there's a variation
    of this is (requires EXTENDED_GLOB):

    % print *.c~f*

    it works in this form, but isn't usable for the original task.
    Neither my copy of zsh manual nor user guide mention that this
    shouldn't work, but it doesn't:

    roman@freepuppy ~/tmp/foo 1030:0 > ls
    bar.c   bar.o   baz.c   baz.o   foo.c
    roman@freepuppy ~/tmp/foo 1031:0 > ls *.c~f*
    bar.c   baz.c
    roman@freepuppy ~/tmp/foo 1032:0 > ls *.c~*.o
    bar.c   baz.c   foo.c
    roman@freepuppy ~/tmp/foo 1033:0 > 

    could anyone explain this to me?
