} We set up automatic e-mail notification of any commits.  (This
} would be easy enough[0].)

I'm curious whether you've found a way to prevent the generation of
one message per subdirectory when a commit spans several subdirs.
CVS is rather insistent that every directory is a "module" ... and
given that there are 8 subdirectories under Completion alone, we
certainly don't want one mesage per directory per commit fired off
to zsh-workers (or even to some new zsh-cvs-commits list).
