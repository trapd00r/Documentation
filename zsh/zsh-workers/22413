I assume that your version of install-info doesn't understand the
--version option?  The Doc/Makefile currently has that as a prerequisite
for using install-info:

    if $(SHELL) -c 'install-info --version' >/dev/null 2>&1; then \
      install-info --dir-file=$(DESTDIR)$(infodir)/dir \
        $(DESTDIR)$(infodir)/$(tzsh).info; \
    else true; fi

It looks like we need some improved logic there.  Perhaps just replacing
"true" with "(cd $(DESTDIR)$(infodir) && install-info $(tzsh).info)" and
letting that succeed or fail would be a good change?
