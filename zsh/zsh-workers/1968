:I did not find it.  I think I accidently deleted it because I thought that

People who *need* older zsh messages (from the math.gatech.edu lists) can get
them from	 http://www.primenet.com.au/zsh/

They are in gzip'ed tar files grouped by message number.
eg.  01xx.tgz   contains messages 100-199
The more recent ones (which don't complete a set) are as individual files.

There are a few missing.  For whatever odd reasons I never received them.

Please don't go too heavy on this site unless you need the articles as I
only have a 64k link (which is why I haven't set it up as an easily browsible
site).  Maybe someone else wants to do it on theirs?

I haven't bothered with the stuff from sterling.com list since it's probably
past its used-by date and gone old and moldy (and probably still on sterling).
