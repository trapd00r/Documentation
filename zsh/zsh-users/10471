} Thanks that hit the spot. Now I have this:

} fg_no_colour=$'%{\e[0m%}'

} lb="%{$fg_dark_gray%}[%{$fg_no_colour%}"

It doesn't really hurt anything in this case, but you've got too many
%{ and %} in there.  You don't need them both within the definition of
$fg_dark_gray et al. and also around the use of same.

} rb="$fg_dark_gray]$fg_no_colour"

That's better.

In one of your earlier messages you had %{ ... %} aournd some thingd
it should not have been, where it did matter, but you seem to have got
that fixed now.
