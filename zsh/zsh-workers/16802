Ah, I see.  Currently it is as you fear, it just uses the string for
which it found a completion function.  That's obviously silly and I'll
change that this evening.

But I'm not really sure which string to prefer in each case.  I'd
prefer the most specific one, i.e. `-redirect-echo-2>' in this case.
Would that be ok for our users if we document it?


Bye
