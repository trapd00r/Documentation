[explanation about ! in command position elided]

I thought it was strange because 3.1.9 didn't behave the same way; it simply
tabs to the next tab position on the input line. So something seems to have
changed although that's not necessarily wrong. Your explanation makes perfect
sense, of course. Thanks.

The shell behaves as you describe; sorry for the false alarm.
