Hmm... sorry about all the traffic... actually, it still doesn't
guarantee to give a canonical path as "readlink -f" does, since it
doesn't check if the value returned is itself a symbolic link, and also
it returns empty instead of the original file if it wasn't a link.  We would
need to do something like the following... if I've correctly divined
that the intention in both cases is that if a file exists at all we
should always use the name, but converted to the canonical form.
