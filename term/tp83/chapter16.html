<H1 CLASS="chapterhead">System Printers &#8211; LP25, LP26 and LP27</H1>
<H2>Overview</H2>
<P>The freestanding LP25, LP26 and LP27 system printers are ideal for a variety of
environments &#8211; data processing, commercial, scientific, industrial and educational.
All versions of the band printer family are supported by UNIBUS PDP-11
and VAX systems, and DECsystem-10s and -20s.</P>
<P>Since this family uses reliable band printer technology, your system printer is
up when you need it. And whatever your workload requirements, Digital has a
system printer for you. The LP25 and LP26 are made for medium-duty work environments
in a one-shift environment, while the LP27 is designed for heavy-duty
applications over two shifts or 16 hour-per-day operation.</P>
<P>The LP25 and LP26 printers operate at medium speeds &#8211; up to 300 and 600
lines per minute, while the LP27 tackles high-speed jobs at rates up to 1,200 lines
per minute.</P>
<P>The following system printers are available.</P>

<H2>Major Features</H2>
<P>The key features for Digital's system printers are:</P>
<H3>LP25, LP26 and LP27</H3>
<UL>
<LI>High throughput printers &#8211; for high volume output.</LI>
<LI>Reliable band technology &#8211; for greater uptime.</LI>
<LI>User changeable bands &#8211; fast and easy replacement.</LI>
<LI>Optional character band kits &#8211; enables you to choose the right band for your
application.</LI>
<LI>Error diagnostic codes &#8211; Helps you pinpoint problems and maintain uptime.</LI>
<LI>Low-cost volume output &#8211; Economical printing and operation.</LI>
</UL>
<H3>LP27</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Advanced printer band technology &#8211; Provides crisp, fully-formed characters of
even density regardless of paper stock used.</LI>
<LI>Solid construction &#8211; Ensures consistent high-performance even during prolonged
printing and paper slewing at maximum speed.</LI>
<LI>Advanced error diagnostic codes &#8211; Enables your service personnel to quickly
identify and correct error conditions.</LI>
</UL>
<H2>Printing Features</H2>
<P>With LP25, LP26 and LP27 system printers, a flat, steel band with raised metal
characters on its face does the printing. This band is mounted on two pulleys &#8211;
one to the right and one to the left of the paper. The LP26 and LP27 hammer banks
have 132 hammers (one for each column), while the LP25's double-faced, shared
hammer bank uses only 66 hammers. These hammers strike twice, providing odd
column hammer strike, followed by an even column scan hammer strike. When
the selected character in an odd or even column comes around on the moving
band, the corresponding hammer strikes it. On the LP26 and LP27 versions, as the
band moves past the paper, every hammer may strike one character per column,
thus printing a line. Because the LP26 and the LP27 use 132 hammers, the hammer
strikes are randomly intermixed depending on what character in any designated
column needs to be printed. For example, you can print characters in seven odd-numbered
columns, and then some characters in three even-numbered columns.</P>
<H3>LP25 Print Speeds</H3>
<P>The LP25 prints at speeds up to 300 lines per minute using an uppercase, 64-character
ASCII set and up to 215 lines per minute using the uppercase and lowercase
94-printing character ASCII set. The 64-character compressed band spaces 15 characters
per inch, versus the standard 10 characters per inch. Because of this spacing
difference, throughput speed decreases to 200 lines per minute.</P>
<H3>LP26 Print Speeds</H3>
<P>The LP26 band printer handles print speeds of up to 600 lines per minute for an
uppercase, 64-character ASCII set. When using the uppercase and lowercase 94-printing
character ASCII set, a maximum speed of 445 lines per minute is possible.</P>
<H3>LP27 Print Speeds</H3>
<P>With this printer, the uppercase, 64-character ASCII set is best for high-speed applications
where maximum print speeds do not exceed 1,200 lines per minute. A minimum
speed of 800 lines per minute is achieved by using the uppercase and lowercase,
94-printing character band.</P>
<H2>Character Sets</H2>
<P>The LP25, LP26 and LP27 print the full 94-character printable ASCII set, up to 132
characters per line. Character form is determined by the band style selected.
Optional character set bands for the LP26 and LP27 include British, German, Finnish/Swedish,
Danish/Norwegian and Spanish/Portuguese. With the LP25, you
can choose any of these, in addition to a compressed printing band, which prints
up to 215 characters per line. The band can be easily changed in a matter of minutes.</P>
<H2>Paper</H2>
<P>The LP25, LP26 and LP27 accept continuous fanfold edge-perforated paper
between 7.6 centimeters (3 inches) and 40.6 centimeters (16 inches) wide. Form
lengths of 27.9 or 30 centimeters (11 or 12 inches) are possible. They accept single-
or multipart carbon forms, and can produce an original and five copies of multipart
carbon forms, up to a maximum thickness of 0.06 centimeters (0.025 inches).</P>

<P>The following accessories, supplies, components, and spares are available for the
LP25, LP26 and LP27 system printers. Check with your sales representative or

<H4>Power Indicator</H4>
<P>This LED is lit when power is on.</P>
<H4>ON/OFF LINE Switch/Indicator</H4>
<P>When the printer is on-line, the indicator is lit. Pressing the switch alternately puts
the printer on-line and off-line. In case a paper low situation is detected, this switch
enables you to continue printing to the bottom of the form. To do this, press the
switch. Each time the switch is pressed, the printer advances the page one line at a
time until the bottom of the page is reached. This is especially important if you are
printing on preprinted forms.</P>
<H4>ALARM/CLEAR Switch/Indicator</H4>
<P>This is lit during powerup or the presence of a fault condition. The specific alarm
condition can be identified by the STATUS indicator display. Pressing the ALARM/CLEAR
switch clears the printer logic.</P>
<H4>PAPER STEP Switch</H4>
<P>When activated, this switch advances the form one line if the printer is off-line.</P>
<H4>TOP OF FORM Switch</H4>
<P>If the printer is off-line, this switch advances the paper to the top-of-the-form position
of the next form.</P>
<H4>PHASE Control</H4>
<P>This control maintains equal printing density on the right and left side of the characters.</P>
<H4>LINES per Inch Switch</H4>
<P>This two-position switch allows you to select either six or eight lines per inch.</P>
<H4>TEST Switch</H4>
<P>This three-position switch allows you to obtain one of three possible test patterns.
Pressing the ON/OFF switch with the TEST switch in the left or right position
places the printer in one of three self-test modes. You can select a sliding pattern,
fixed characters, or band image.</P>
<H4>STATUS Indicator</H4>
<P>This alphanumeric display indicates either the operation being performed or a fault
that caused printer failure.</P>
<H4>COPIES Control</H4>
<P>This is a variable control that allows you to select printing on single- or multiple-part
forms. Use the lowest possible setting that gives a clear printout. This helps you
get the maximum life use from the hammers, ribbon and print band.</P>

<H2>Operator</H2>
<P>The LP11 controller has two internal registers: the Control and Status Register
(LXCS) and the Data Buffer Register (LXDB). Refer to Appendix J for the LXCS and
LXDB diagrams.</P>
<P>When the READY bit in the control and status register is set, the lineprinter is
ready to accept a character from the processor.</P>
<P>The processor loads characters one by one into the data buffer register in the
controller. The controller then transfers the characters to the 132-character data
buffer in the lineprinter. The line length of 132 characters corresponds directly to
this 132-character data buffer.</P>
<P>The current data buffer register (LXDB) contents are automatically printed out
whenever any of the three ASCII control codes (Carriage Feed, Line Feed, Form
Return) is recognized. The Carriage Return (CR) code prints the line but does not
advance the paper. The Line Feed (LF) code advances the paper one line, while the
Form Feed (FF) code advances the paper to the top of the next page.</P>
<P>Forms may be as long as 143 lines, and 12 different Vertical Tab Stops (channels)
are available.</P>
<H3>Start Load Command</H3>
<P>The Start Load command (356<SUB>8</SUB>) initializes the PVFU and causes all subsequent
characters to be loaded into the PVFU buffer. The Stop Load command (357<SUB>8</SUB>) indicates
the end of the characters to be loaded into the PVFU buffer. The PVFU buffer
allows storage of two characters for each line of the form. The PVFU only uses the
low-order six bits of each character. The 12 bits (two characters) stored per line in
the PVFU correspond to the 12 Vertical Tab Stops.</P>
<P>A 1 bit in a bit position in one of these two characters assigns a Vertical Tab Stop
to that line. Bits 0 through 5 of the first characters correspond to Vertical Tab Stops
1 through 6 while bits 0 through 5 of the second character correspond to Vertical
Tab Stops 7 through 12.</P>
<H3>Vertical Tab Stop Commands</H3>
<P>Vertical Tab Stops are commands 200<SUB>8</SUB> through 213<SUB>8</SUB>. A Vertical Tab Stop command
sent anywhere in a line of characters causes the paper to advance to the next PVFU
line indicated by that Vertical Tab Stop command at the next Line Feed code. Line
1 is assigned to Vertical Tab Stop 1 and the last line of the form is assigned to
Vertical Tab Stop 12.</P>
<H3>Form Movement Commands</H3>
<P>Sending command 200<SUB>8</SUB> causes the paper to advance to the top of the next form.
Commands 201<SUB>8</SUB> through 212<SUB>8</SUB> correspond to Vertical Tab Stops 2 through 11 and
cause the paper to advance to the next line that is loaded with that Vertical Tab
Stop. Command 213<SUB>8</SUB> causes the paper to advance to the bottom of the form.</P>
<H2>Interrupts</H2>
<P>The LP11 controller uses bus request (BR) interrupts to gain control of the UNIBUS
to perform a vectored interrupt, which causes the program to branch to an interrupt
service routine. A BR interrupt can occur only if the INTERRUPT ENABLE bit
in the control and status register is set. Once INTERRUPT ENABLE bit is set, an
interrupt request is generated whenever either the READY or ERROR bit in the
control and status register is set.</P>
<P>When the READY bit is set, the lineprinter is ready to accept the next character
to be loaded into the data buffer register (LXDB). When the ERROR bit is set, it
indicates that some error condition exists. In this case, an interrupt is generated to
cause the program to branch to an error handling routine.</P>
<P>The interrupt priority level is 4 and the interrupt vector address is 200. Note that
the priority level be changed with a priority plug and the vector address can be
changed by jumpers in the interrupt control logic. However, any Digital programs
or other software referring to the priority level or interrupt vector address must also
be changed if the priority plug or vector address is changed.</P>
<H2>Maintenance</H2>
<P>Digital's LP25, LP26 and LP27 are designed for long life expectancy, high-volume
throughput, and continuous smooth performance. While Digital's system printers
are designed for a maximum amount of usage with a minimum amount of maintenance,
preventative maintenance, such as routine inspections, cleaning, and adjustments,
ensure good print quality and printer reliability. Digital recommends that
maintenance be handled by trained personnel &#8211; whether yours or ours.</P>
<H3>Self-test Procedure</H3>
<P>The three-position TEST switch allows you to exercise the self-test function and
obtain one of three possible test patterns. Pressing the ON/OFF switch with the
TEST switch in the left or right position places the printer in the self-test mode.</P>
<UL>
<LI>With the TEST switch in the right-hand position, pressing the ON/OFF LINE
switch produces the printing of a sliding pattern.</LI>
<LI>Placing the TEST switch in the left position and pressing the ON/OFF LINE
switch produces the printing of a fixed character pattern.</LI>
<LI>After producing either the sliding or the fixed pattern, you can place the TEST
switch in the center position. This enables the printer to stay in self-test mode,
printing full lines of a given character and changing the character for each line
printed, reflecting a band image pattern.</LI>
</UL>
<P>To exit from self-test mode, place the TEST switch in the center position and press
the ON/OFF LINE switch.</P>
<H3>Operator Troubleshooting Checklist</H3>
<P>The LP25, LP26 and LP27 system printers have a diagnostic status indicator
located on the operator control panel. The indicator displays a status code that
depicts the operation being performed or a fault that caused the printer to go off-line.
Below are listed some of the common status codes, what they mean, and what
corrective action can be taken.</P>
