Subject: RE: Problem running zsh on WinNT 4.0
Date: Fri, 12 Feb 1999 12:54:34 -0800
X-Mailer: Internet Mail Service (5.5.2524.0)

on nt 4.0 zsh will actually look for a $USERPROFILE directory. it  may be
that
variable is not being set automatically. I don't quite know why that would
be.

If someone who has had to explicitly HOME (via the environment settings or
usrmgr)
would send me a dump of their environment from a cmd.exe prompt, I'll
try to figure out what's going on.

of course, please make sure that $ZSH_VERSION is 3.0.5-nt-beta-0.50 (or
greater).
If  the version does not contain the "nt-beta.." part, then you are probably
using 
a cygwin or u/win or interix zsh, not mine.


thanks,
-amol
