I find Texinfo to be OK.  Using Emacs, it's easier to read than
manpages (although TkMan is wonderful, so I don't mind reading
manpages).  It also prints out nicely (it's annoying that it's awkward
to get PostScript fonts, but presumably they'll fix that one day), and
(and here I agree entirely with Zefram) it's easy to get the whole
manual, and easy to read the whole thing from beginning to end.  (It's
possible for sadists to produce manuals where you can't do this, but it
requires deliberate malice.)

If I had to pick *one* format, I'd choose Texinfo, but using yodl (so
we can get multiple formats) seems to work fine.
