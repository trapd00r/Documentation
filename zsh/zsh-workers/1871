Well, when zsh is invoked as zsh it does not pretend to be Bourne shell
compatible.  That's not a bug.  Zsh is really Bourne compatible if called
as sh.  The complicated *zsh* test in procmail is unnecessary.  It'll never
work.  The problem is that procmail tells that zsh is broken.  Zsh is not
broken, it is simply different from a Bourne shell when invoked as zsh.
Procmail should just inform the user that it uses /bin/sh or whatever
instead of zsh and should not spread misinformation about zsh.
