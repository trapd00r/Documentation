See what I've done with my two patches today, labelled "zefram1" and
"zefram2".  I don't see this getting confusing.  It'd get confusing
if people actually used non-unique patch IDs, granted, so let's get it
right right from the start, OK?

grep for the full unique patch ID (e.g., "zefram2").  The first mention
is overwhelmingly likely to be the patch you're looking for; the ID
appears in the ChangeLog hunk, so you could narrow down your grepping
a bit on that basis.

"wischnow22396" vs "pws22396".

Their patches get committed, by Peter, after they've been mailed.
They can be identified everywhere (commit log, ChangeLog, etc.) by
mailing list sequence number.
