    Hi Lloyd :)

    True :)) It's quite uncommon, anyway, but it's nice to see a
sysadmin with a pet feeling for his users ;)) Last time I suffered a
sysadmin, back at the university, I end up thinking summoning
Nyarlathotep for eating him was a pretty good idea. Fortunately I'm
not good at globbing nor at casting spells. And you don't want a
fiasco summoning an elder one XDDDD

    Pretty good...

    Thanks a lot, truly!!!!. I can't believe, you don't abuse your
users, you comment your code... Who are you and what have you done
with the *real* sysadmin? XDDD

    Thanks for the function, I'll stea^H^H^H^Hinspire from it }:)
Seriously, I'll adopt and adapt it for my system, thanks ;)
