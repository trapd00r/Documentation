    Well, he gave me the solution for the assignment without a loop ;)

    Oh, yes, I forgot about that. I simply assumed that, since array
values are space separated by default, the contents of the variables
were too. I didn't remember about word splitting O:)

    Thanks a lot for the explanation, Bart ;)
