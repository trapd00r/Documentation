I'm now more confused by Andrej's message.  I thought he was saying that
a test wasn't needed for 2.50, but it looks like he was actually saying
we need a test anyway, and it's not available in 2.50.  In that case, we
can't get rid of the lines but it still won't always work.

(The subtext is `whoever understands this, please fix it'.)
