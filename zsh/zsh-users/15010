(i.e. directories up to the / before the cursor).  That would make
perfect sense as an option, but unfortunately the file completion code
lives in one of the ditches in the eighth circle of hell ("Malecompo",
or something like that), and we're worried we won't be able to get back
from there.  However, you might have imagined that it wouldn't be too
difficult to extend accept-exact-dirs, which in turn wasn't so difficult
to add.
