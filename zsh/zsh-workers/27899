This is actually coming from _main_complete, here:

if [[ "$compstate[old_list]" =3D keep ]]; then
  ZLS_COLORS=3D"$_saved_colors"
elif (( $#_comp_colors )); then
  ZLS_COLORS=3D"${(j.:.)_comp_colors}"
else
  unset ZLS_COLORS
fi

I guess there should be a second test that $_saved_colors is non-empty
before assigning it to ZLS_COLORS ... but I'm not sure that's correct
either, because we don't know at this point *why* $_saved_colors is
empty, i.e., whether the value when saved was empty or unset.
