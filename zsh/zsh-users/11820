The TRAPDEBUG function is called at these points in the execution,
if you "setopt DEBUG_BEFORE_CMD".  However, I don't remember offhand
whether it's possible to access the command text that is about to be
executed.  The documentation for TRAPDEBUG is pretty sparse.

(Also DEBUG_BEFORE_CMD requires a very recent zsh version.)
