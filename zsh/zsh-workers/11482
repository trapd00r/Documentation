} Maybe i missed something but _arguments don't do his job, thing like :
} 
} rpm -ba --[tab]

When I do that, I get:

    Completing `build', `spec file', `file', or `corrections'

So somewhere else there is an argument spec for '-ba' that says the next
argument can't be an option.  ^X? is your friend; it indicates that the
actual problem is in the `build_b' state in _rpm, and not in _arguments.

However, I'm not up to trying to fix it at the moment ...
