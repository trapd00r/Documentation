Hi,
I want to get the output of a command in my prompt=20
(actually, I want the temperature of my cpu in RPS1 if it is superior=20
to a some predifined value).
So I have something like :
 RPS1=3D"%2v"
 and=20

precmd() {
    gettemp
}

with gettemp that gets temperature and puts it in psvar[2] if needed.

Today, I've seen in zsh user guide :

> Some people make the mistake of using it [precmd function] to set up a=20
> prompt, but there are enough ways of getting varying information into a=
=20
> fixed prompt string that you shouldn't do that unless you have very odd=
=20
> things in your prompt.
http://zsh.sunsite.dk/Guide/zshguide03.html#l51

But I didn't find a better way to do what I want. Did I miss something,=20
or is my goal something "very odd".

thanks=20
arno
