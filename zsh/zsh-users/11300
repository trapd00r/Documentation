SUSv3:
[snip]
ENV   This variable, when and only when an interactive shell is
      invoked, shall be subjected to parameter expansion (see
      Parameter Expansion) by the shell, and the resulting value
      shall be used as a pathname of a file containing shell
      commands to execute in the current environment. The file
      need not be executable. If the expanded value of ENV is not
      an absolute pathname, the results are unspecified. ENV shall
      be ignored if the real and effective user IDs or real and
      effective group IDs of the process are different.
