Shouldn't there be some way to flush the caches (in _retrieve_cache)?
I.e. some style that says when the caches should be rebuilt.

This could be done either by a style with values that describe update
policies sensible in enough possible contexts or by using a boolean
style and let users use `zstyle -e' to implement their own policy (and 
of course users could do that in the first case, too, but there may be 
ways to make this more convenient for common cases).

Bye
 Sven
