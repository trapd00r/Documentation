Hi

i tried to install zsh-3.0.0 on AIX-4.1.4. The configure program choose to
link with termcap. The result was that the bach-space key seemed to work
internally, but not for the output:

machine% vii[backspace][return]

starts up vi, but instead of correcting 'vii' into 'vi', adds a space to
'vii':

machine% vii [return]

So, i read the ChangeLog entry about prefering curses above
termcap on AIX-3.2.*, and i changed the LIBS in the ./Makefile from
-ltermcap into -lcurses. After relinking, the new zsh appeared to work
correctly, and had no problem with the backspace. 

Greetings,
