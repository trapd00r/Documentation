Scratch that.  It is SIGCHLD.  Looks like the pthread clone delivers a
SIGCHLD and zsh thinks that gdb is being suspended for some reason.

Question: What file/line of the zsh code actually writes out this
line?  It seems to not be in any of the signal handlers nor
waitpid/job/jobs functions.  This would be helpful in finding out how
the child signal is being processed.

	zsh: 2161 suspended (tty output)  gdb intel_redhat_6_2/cmd

Thanks much,
