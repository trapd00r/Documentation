That looks quite good to me.  I tested it a bit, and the new code seems
to be working as expected, so I checked it in.  Thanks!

While I was testing it, I discovered that the completion system is not
completing the options to gnu ls correctly, which appears to be a bug:
Several options get lost, including --format, -1, -x, and --color (I did
not do an exhaustive search to know exactly how many).  If I get rid of
the rule defining -F, many of these missing options come back (though
not --color).  Very strange, but totally unrelated to the just-committed
changes.
