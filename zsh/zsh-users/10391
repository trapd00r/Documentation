I believe the ^^^ substitute mechanism is syntactic sugar for:-
> r old=new

The uses I know:-

^fred^joe             # edit previous command replace fred by joe
^str1^str2^:u:p       # replace str1 by str2 change case and just display
^fred^&&              # replace fred by fredfred

Any more? and where should I look in the man pages?

There was some talk about adding a global modifier?
