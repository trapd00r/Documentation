Subject: PATCH: zshexit hook

I think, now we have proper hooks, we need a hook on exit, since the
same issues can occur with TRAPEXIT as with precmd etc.; also it
means something different within a function, so always feels like a bit
of a hack.

The code is now trivial (and won't cause an endless loop any more).
I've called the zshexit; can anyone think of a better name,
i.e. something memorable which won't clash with user functions?
