I committed the non-controversial part of my array-assignment patch.
The second hunk of my params.c diff that just improved the boundary
checking (avoiding the weird cases you sited).  I have not (yet?)
changed array[0]'s meaning nor have I implemented the alternate
solution I proposed, pending further comments.
