GCC was never a C compiler - (without additinal options) it was always a "GNU C" compiler
which is just different language sometimes.

O.K., I admit I was too eager - but I had too many cases when a good program was so
GCC-specific that it made no sense to even try to port it.

So, the question - is there any flags that will enable "compatible" mode at least for
debug builds? Can we use them?
