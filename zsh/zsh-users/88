Paul Falstad no longer maintains zsh.  Zsh is currently maintained
by the Zsh Development Group (fancy name for a mailing list).  To
get the latest info on the mailing lists and ftp sites, check the
META-FAQ available at:

ftp.math.gatech.edu/pub/zsh/META-FAQ

or the html version at:

http://www.math.gatech.edu/zsh/meta-faq.html

zsh2.3.1 is quite old.  The completion facilities in zsh has changed
considerably since then.  The current production release of zsh is
zsh2.5.03.  The latest beta release is zsh-2.6-beta10 (with beta11
a week or so away).  I would suggest you try beta10.  It is fairly
stable and builds quite easily.  I'm not very familar with tcsh, but
if there is anything you can do in tcsh that zsh can't do, I would
be very surprised.

The hard part about using zsh compctl is that the man page for this
is difficult to read.  It has already been rewritten and the new
version will appear in beta11.
