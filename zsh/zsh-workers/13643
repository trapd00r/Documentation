This makes sense to me, too.  Zsh/Builtin is, in a way, redundant; whose
builtins would we be completing, if not zsh's?

} I think these should go in X/Command because they are all dependant on
} having X.

I agree there.

On a slightly related note, I was wondering whether it's worthwhile to
create Cygwin/Type/_path_files that includes Andrej's suggestions about
calling cygdrive, etc.  Then we'd have to make sure that Cygwin appeared
first in $fpath with --enable-function-subdirs, but was installed *after*
Unix without it ... it's also possible that netscape has different options
when executed under cygwin, so we'd need Cygwin/Command/_netscape, etc.

What should we do when there might be two conflicting implementations of
a given completion component for different operating systems?

} My preference would be for the lowest level to be removed leaving
} directories for AIX, Linux, Zsh etc but not having directories for
} Type, Command etc.

I agree with this.  If you're going to put Unix/Command in your $fpath,
can you ever *not* need Unix/Utility and Unix/Type as well?
