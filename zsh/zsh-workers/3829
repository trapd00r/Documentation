As a simple user I've always noticed Zefram's dedication and
helpfulness, even on trivial questions. I also trust his judgement on
what patches to include into zsh because his decisions are always
soundly argumented and well explained. Zefram is the ideal "Primus inter
pares" to take over zsh maintenance.
