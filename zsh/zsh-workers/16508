I've had a closer look at this. It's because calling _describe adds
the faked matches in a -V-group and later the normal matches are added
in a -J-group.

Hrm.  Both showing -V- and -J-groups together or removing duplicates
in such pairs of groups with the same name could mess things up
terribly, so that's not a possible solution.

Maybe I've got to re-think the whole fake-style thing again.


But anyway, the descriptions should be added by _cvs.


Bye
  Sven
