I was afraid it happens sometimes ...

I had this 'autoload $^fpath/*(N:t)' in my .zshrc ... and all worked nice and
fine ... until I suddenly found that subscript does not work as expected.

bor@itsrm2:~%> zsh -f
itsrm2% bindkey -e
itsrm2% source /tools/share/zsh/functions/compinit
itsrm2% autoload $^fpath/*(N:t)
itsrm2% zmodload parameter
itsrm2% print $parameters[ksh<TAB>
beeps

Now, how many users do have the same in .zshrc? This autoloading was suggested
by some of Zsh docs (may be FAQ?) I agree, that it is nice trick - you can
simply get all functions at the *end* of .zshrc as I had it.
