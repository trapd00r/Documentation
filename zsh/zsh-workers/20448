The patch below "fixes" it, but that cross-product null-glob causes a 
noticeable delay on my limping old 233MHz home system.

While we're on the subject, does anyone remember why the tilde (~) appears
in the following expansion of fpath in compdump (line 26 in my copy)?

_d_files=( ${^~fpath:/.}/^([^_]*|*~|*.zwc)(N) )

I can't come up with a reason you'd want patterns in fpath globbed there.
Same thing a few lines lower for _d_wfiles.

Here's the patch.  It just occurred to me that this breaks if some .zwc
files contain the function definitions but the original function files
are missing, so I'm not going to commit it just yet.
