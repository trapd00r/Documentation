} Thanks much. In that case, could I make this a feature request?

What I meant was, the filesystem typically doesn't provide any way to
discover whether a directory is empty without looking for files in it.

So even if zsh implemented an "empty directory" globbing flag internally,
it'd be doing effectively the same thing as the function I showed.  And
that must be what "find ... -empty" is doing as well.
