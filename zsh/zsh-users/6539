I use menu-complete. I also have the following specified:

zstyle ':completion:*:*:(^rm):*:*' ignored-patterns '*?.o' '*?~' '(|*/)CVS' '*?.class'

so that object files, CVS directories etc are never tab completed. Now,
I've realized that I sometimes still want to do something more than
removing these kinds of files, and I've been bitten a couple of times by
the fact that these files seem not to be there, as far as the completion
system is concerned. So my question is this: is it possible to specify
that these files be completed, but only after all other possibilities have
been tried? I.e. if my directory contains the files:

aa.o bb.class cc.txt

pressing <tab> once gives me cc.txt, twice gives me aa.o etc?

TIA,

Jesper
