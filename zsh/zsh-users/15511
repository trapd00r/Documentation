Subject: Completion menu highlight colour

  This is stupidity on my part, because I it working a few days ago.

  Completion menu selection works fine using

zstyle ':completion:*' menu select=2

So, how am I supposed to alter the colour of the highlight? Simply
adding ma=... to the list-colours style seems odd (and also doesn't seem
to have any effect). But, as I said, I sorted this out before...

  Thanks!
