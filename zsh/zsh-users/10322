 "vi mode and history-search key binding" (May 27,  8:39pm)

This binds those keys in the main keymap, which by default is the emacs
keymap.  Have you somewhere earlier in your startup files executed a
"bindkey -v" command?  If you did, then those bind keys in the viins
keymap (insert mode), not the vicmd keymap (command mode).  In which
mode are you attempting to invoke the search?

} It appears to have no effect. Is this intended?

The effect you should see is that a quetion-mark (for backward) or slash
(for forward) prompt appears below the PS1 prompt; you then enter the
string to search for.  If that doesn't happen, you've probably bound
the keys in the wrong keymap.
