RedHat ships something called "htmlview" which tries to guess what web 
browser to invoke based on what desktop you're running (gnome, kde, etc.)
and what browsers are installed on the system.

It might be useful to have pick-web-browser look for htmlview before going 
on a browser search of its own.  Or perhaps not.
