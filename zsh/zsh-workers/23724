Subject: zsh updated on FreeBSD ports collection
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Content-Disposition: inline

For FreeBSD users,

I've committed the update to version 4.3.4 on ports some minutes ago.
Now ports tree is up to date. I've already added on ports 3
completions that was already committed to zsh cvs but are not on 4.3.4
yet: csup, portsnap and portlint.

Please report any bugs if you find.

Thanks
