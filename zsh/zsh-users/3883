OK, I'm stumped. I got a DEC VT220, connected it to my internet
gateway box and stuck a getty on it. Everything is fine until I try to
run zsh, which doesn't seem to do anything.

I had to change my login shell to bash, which works happily. The only
thing I wasn't expecting is that $TERM is "linux" rather than "vt220",
could this be affecting zsh?

I'm running the unstable version of debian (whatever it's called these
days...)

oscar:/home/alan>echo $ZSH_VERSION 
4.0.1-pre-3

Any ideas or anything blatantly obvious that I'm missing?

Thanks!
