Hmm ok, then.. time to reformulate the question.. I want to configure
what TAB does :-) I assume that is Completion then. 

The main confusion was when quickly (yeah I know, I should take my
time..) reading through chapter 6 of the zshguide "Completion and
expansion",

Just an example from my side, sort of "is it these I should poke
on?" (from the zsh users guide) or are they replaced by 
        "zstyle ':completion:*' completer _list ..."
or do they work together? If I have got stuff right, the zstyle
replaces them?

So basically.. remove all my options for completion, run compinstall
and live happily for the rest of the time :-)?

Thank you !
