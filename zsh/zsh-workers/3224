zsh_name is set to zsh's argv[0], which is whatever the execing program
wants it to be.

Opinion: this behaviour of su is broken.  It should set argv[0]
conventionally -- the shell has no need to know it is being run by su.

No, there's a reason why zsh_name gets set to argv[0].  zsh will emulate
ksh or POSIX sh if argv[0] (and therefore zsh_name) are set to "ksh" or
"sh".  If zsh_name were always "zsh", there wouldn't be any point in it
being a variable.
