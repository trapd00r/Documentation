This is documented in the manual.  "popd +2" pulls the second item after
the head from the stack then changes to the new top.  The new top is still
/usr.

If you are trying to remove /usr and ~ from the stack completely
use "repeat 2 popd".  If you do this a lot, try

  rpopd() { repeat $1 popd; }

If you're just trying to bring /tmp to the head you need "pushd +2".
