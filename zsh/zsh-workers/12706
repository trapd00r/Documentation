Hmm, what will "stty -echo" do to typeahead?

Would it suffice to insert

if read -t -k 1
then
    print -z $REPLY
    return 0
fi

before the stty call?

It might be nice if "read -t -k 0" simply returned 0 if there's pending
input and 1 otherwise, without reading anything.  Right now, -k 0 is
treated the same as -k 1 (read always reads at least one byte).
