http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/uwin/ says
"The U/WIN package provides a mechanism for building and running UNIX applications on Windows NT and Windows 95 with few, if any, changes necessary."
Like MKS and unlike OpenNT, it does everything in terms of .exe files, so you can run them from the shell.

U/WIN is available free.

Only problem is that zsh's ./configure crashes.  Has anyone else started to work on this?  If not, I'll ask David Korn to look at it.

Thanks
