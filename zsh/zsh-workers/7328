Subject: Bug: using send-break at "select" prompt breaks a bit too much
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Check this out:

function oops() {
   setopt localoptions localtraps
   trap "echo got signal" 0 1 2 3 15 ZERR DEBUG
   select x in a b c
   do echo $REPLY
   done
   echo "finished select"
}

Put that in your $fpath and run "oops".  Try ^C and ^\ (or ^_ or whatever
you have sending QUIT).  Then use ^G (send-break).  Note that the whole
function is killed, but "finished select" is never printed nor are any
traps triggered.

Now try the same thing with "zsh -ic oops".  It shouldn't matter much.
