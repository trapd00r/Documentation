Incredible.  I've had this long article on locales in the FAQ for some
time now and nobody, certainly not me, ever found the simple answer.

3.7: How do I make the completion list use eight bit characters?

  If you are sure your terminal handles this, the easiest way is to
  set the option PRINT_EIGHT_BIT.  In principle, this will work
  automatically if your computer uses the `locale' system and your
  locale variables are set properly, as zsh understands this.
  However, it is quite complicated, so if it isn't already set up,
  trying the option is a lot easier.
