    Hi all :)

    If I do this:

    zle -C mycompleter expand-or-complete _mycompleter
    bindkey "^I" mycompleter

    function _mycompleter (){
        compadd -f - *
    }

    then completion doesn't work because compadd tries to match the
'tab' itself with the list of matches :((( It doesn't happen if I
bind '^O', for example, to the new widget. What I'm doing wrong? It
seems like the tab is being used and inserted instead of the list of
matches :????

    I use zsh 4.0.9 and no compsys. Thanks in advance :)
