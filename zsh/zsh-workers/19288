I still haven't understood under what circumstances you'd be doing that.
Are you demanding that sometimes when zle is started up, such as
for a continuation line, you want to maintain the current keymap?
That's way beyond the original idea of an initialisation widget.

However, I think some sort of context is a good idea anyway.
Unfortunately zle is not the most object-oriented piece of code, but it
shouldn't be too hard.
