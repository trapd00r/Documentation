I normally use menu completion, and would expect it to be as following:

the list of possible matches is built case-insensitive (using whatever current locale says), but the choices are present as is. That is, giving readme, Readme and ReadMe, pressing "less rTAB" would list all three files as is. So, I would have full control over which file to select.

Now it's getting confusing. If the completion tells me a different file
name than the one acutally stored in the file system, I can easily imagine
cases in which I am not sure what the command, the completion is used for,
is going to do.
