Is that also the case when you start `zsh -f'?

That can't be, either, because `zsh -f' doesn't read your rc's ...

That might be it, but since you said later that pressing TAB causes it
to autoload, it must not be.

Aha.  We have a winner.

The default startup code explicitly loads both zsh/zle and zsh/compctl if
zsh/zle has not already been loaded.  Anything in your rc files that
causes zsh/zle to be loaded, including bindkey, causes zsh/compctl to be
skipped at startup.

Next, the completion code loads zsh/compctl only if zsh/complete is not
already loaded, but zsh/complist has a dependency on zsh/complete and
zsh/zle, so if you load zsh/complist explicitly it blocks all possible
routes to zsh/compctl except explicit autoloading or a compctl command.

Whew.  This should probably be considered a bug, but the only way I can
think of to fix it is to use a different module than zsh/complete as the
test for whether a completion system other than compctl is in use.
