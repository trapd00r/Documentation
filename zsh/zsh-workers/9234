And a good example: after compiling/installing the fresh dev-14

/home/bor/.zshrc:9: failed to load module: zsh/complete
/home/bor/.zshrc:bindkey:19: no such keymap `menuselect'
compinit:475: failed to load module: zsh/complete
compinit:zstyle:475: autoload failed
compinit:476: command not found: zstyle
compinit:477: command not found: zstyle
compinit:478: command not found: zstyle
compinit:479: command not found: zstyle
compinit:480: command not found: zstyle
compinit:481: command not found: zstyle
compinit:483: command not found: zstyle
compinit:517: failed to load module: zsh/complete
compinit:zle:517: can't load complete module

And now I'd really like to start previous version again ...
