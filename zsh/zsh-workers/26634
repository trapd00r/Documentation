Oops, sorry about that.  Don't know how I missed it.

} Wolfgang, what happens if you explicitly disable multibyte support (--
} disable-multibyte) during build?

BTW I tried "unsetopt multibyte" when fiddling with this on my Mac, and
"unknown" characters were still displayed as <00c3>.  (Which is better
than in 4.3.4, where they are both displayed and processed as %C3.)
