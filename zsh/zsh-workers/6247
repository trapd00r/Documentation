Subject: PATCH for 3.0.6 (was: Re: compctl question)


I wrote:

Those who have tried this with 3.0.6 will have noticed a display bug:
in listmatches() trashzle() gets called with the line prepared for
completion. If there are characters that need quoting, ll will be
different from the real line length. The patch below is a *very*
simple(-minded) attempt to fix that. But due to its simplicity it
should be very robust.

Bye
 Sven
