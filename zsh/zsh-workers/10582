Subject: PATCH: Don't STTY if you can't use it
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

When the STTY variable was in the enviroment, background jobs or any other
job that wasn't allowed to read/write the terminal would stop on SIGTTIN,
often silently because their parent wasn't doing job control.

This patch makes STTY apply only to process group leaders.  That may be a
bit too extreme, but it seems to do the right thing in every case I tried.
Better ideas welcome.
