'sg' is really just a convenient wrapper for 'newgrp'.

$ l =sg =newgrp
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root     6 2008-09-10 09:12 /usr/bin/sg -> newgrp
-rws--x--x 1 root root 19684 2008-09-10 09:12 /usr/bin/newgrp

So, that's one "work-around" that's not a workaround. Did it work in your 
case, though? I'd be surprised if it worked when 'newgrp' didn't.

And the two tricks I mentioned are pretty stupid (but have worked for me). 
(I didn't know about 'newgrp' or 'sg' before this thread.)

Best,
Ben
