} I've uploaded something for chapter 4 of the user guide

I'm reading through section 4.1, and it looks good so far.

One suggestion: In the paragraph where you're discussing `bindkey -me'
you might point people to Functions/Misc/zkbd which will tell them whether
and how their ALT and META keys work.

Typo: "At this point you are in the magic word of vi ..." I think should
say "... the magic world of ...".  Unless you know something I don't?
I've tried "open sesame" and "abracadabra" ...

Oops, out of time.  I'll have to read 4.2 etc. later.
