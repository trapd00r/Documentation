/usr/bin/install -c  zsh.exe /usr/bin/zsh-3.1.9-dev-3.exe
/usr/bin/install: /usr/bin/zsh-3.1.9-dev-3.exe: Permission denied

This is when Zsh is currently running.

I remeber having seen some dicussion on this matter (cannot rename opened
file), and a fix was suggested. Is it going to appear in 1.1.3 release?
