That's not how my Vim completion works.  (Big fan of the popupmenu and 
supertab.)  I guess you like i_CTRL-X_CTRL-L?  I much prefer 
i_CTRL-X_CTRL-O for the general case, falling back to i_CTRL-X_CTRL-I. 
(Both of which I access via '<Tab>'.)

>From your description, though, I think you're looking for:

history-beginning-search-{forward,backward}

(Someone complained about the name recently, but the gist of 
'beginning-' is that it searches from the beginning of the line entered 
thus far.)
