Actually, I'm not sure of that. According to the info page for find, a 
directory will always have two hard links, itself and it's "." pointer. 
Adding any subdirectories or files to it seems to increase the number 
of links it has. So wouldn't *(/l2) find empty directories? Or is this 
hard-link policy not true on all systems?
