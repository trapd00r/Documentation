	unsetopt HASH_CMDS

But you probably don't want to do that, because the hashing gives a
great performance improvement and is usually correct.  If you type

	rehash

each time after you make changes to the commands in the path, you still
get the benefit of hashing at the times when you're not adding and
removing commands.
