    I still don't understand. The first form, if MAGIC_EQUAL_SUBST is
on, is eligible for filename expansion (the filename is '1'), but in
the second form the filename would be '=1', that's all the
difference. Oh, I see, the '1' could be a filename, and if it cannot
be expanded, nothing occurs, but the second form expands differently,
since it is the '=filename' construction.

    BTW, if EQUALS is off and MAGIC_EQUAL_SUBST is on, this doesn't
happen, because the =filename construct is never tried, I wasn't
aware of this. 

    Thanks for your help :)
