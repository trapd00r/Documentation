Subject: file completion bug
Date: Wed, 14 Jul 1999 14:08:13 +0200
From: Peter Stephenson <pws@ibmth.df.unipi.it>

Something weird is going on, presumably after some recent change to
_path_files.

With zsh -f, completion loaded, and compconfig[completer] set to
_complete:_correct ,

% echo ~/tmp/d1/<TAB>

goes to

% echo ~/tmp/RCS//

and offers corrections in tmp.  But tmp/d1 exists; I don't want to alter
the directory I'm completing in just because it's empty.
