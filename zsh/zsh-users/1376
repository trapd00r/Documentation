It seems that fixed my problem.

In fact I didn't know that zsh looks in my 0 after $EDITOR
variable(which I like to set it to "vim"). Thank you!

Another issue:
 There is a problem in zsh-3.0.5 which I can't reproduce it. Sometimes, not
 very often, it happens to exit unexpectedly from my session. It seems that
it executes the commands found in .zlogout it. Last time when I saw that my
last command was: 


dmircea@mail:/home/dmircea% echo "somth";ls

The output was something like:
somth
... {ls output} ...
dmircea@mail:/home/dmircea% logout
Logout



The last string("Logout") was printed by .zlogout with an echo command.

I use zsh-3.0.5 on a Linux 2.0.33 running on a Intel P200. Any hints?
