If you've got 3.1.9 installed, you can type <ESC /> or <ESC ,> to invoke
the _history-complete-older or _history-complete-newer bindings.  The
above styles control whether the search cycles through the history and
whether it ever offers duplicate words -- except that it should be
`remove-all-dups' with hyphens, not underscores, and the value `yep'
does not work, it has to be `yes' `true' `1' or `on'.  So Adam must not
be using the distributed version of _history_complete_word.

Oh, you do need to have run "compinit" to enable those bindings.

You can also add _history to your completer style like this:

	zstyle ':completion:*' completer _complete _history

to have the history searched when you hit TAB and regular completion does
not find anything.  (Or put it in front of _complete to have the history
tried first, but that's probably not what you want.)
