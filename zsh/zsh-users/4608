I had a zsh shell running on a remote machine (two sessions). It was
working well until I had a temporary connection problem (something
wrong in the routing), which lasted a few minutes. But after the
problem was solved, I couldn't use these shells any longer. Why?

Note: I tried to kill them with kill -TERM, but the shells were still
there. Then I tried a kill -9, which killed the shells and the ssh
connections terminated immediately.
