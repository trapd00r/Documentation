Back in the past there was exactly this problem with Zle - if displayed line was
exactly screen-width long, output was wrong. It was fixed by Geoff in a  patch
4855 (I just looked up in archive).

Sven, could you check if something from this patch is aplicable in this case?

Well, I am sorry for this as well ... but you see, to send _reply_ to
zsh-workers that is in To: header I have to hit "reply-to-all" - there is no
other possibility


And exactly for this I'm using procmail with formail filter that eliminates
duplicates (as long, as message-id is preserved) - so I get exactly one copy of
all duplicates.
