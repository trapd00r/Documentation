    Hi Tero :)

    'typeset -U' just 'uniqize', it doesn't normalize. You're looking
for something like (EXTENDED_GLOB must be set, for the '#'):

    path=(${(qq)${path//\/##/\/}%/})

    This converts multiple slashes to just one, and then removes the
last one. The '(qq)' part is needed just in case 'path' has elements
with spaces in it.

    Just add that command at the end of the last config file read. If
the shell is interactive, try /etc/zshrc (well, I don't know which
name it has under cygwin, sorry).

    Hope that helps :)
