Hi,

 got a mysterious (at least for me) effect:

        Script started on Sun May 28 17:14:22 2006
        solfire:/home/mccramer>ls -l /bin/zsh
        rwxr-xr-x 2 root root 754456 Mar 28 18:32 /bin/zsh
        solfire:/home/mccramer>cat ~/bin/tempwatch
        #!/bin/zsh
        while true
        do
            sensors
            sleep 10
        done | grep 'CPU Temp'
        
        solfire:/home/mccramer>~/bin/tempwatch
 ???>>> zsh: no such file or directory: /home/mccramer/bin/tempwatch
        solfire:/home/mccramer>while true
        while> do
        while> sensors
        while> sleep 10
        while> done | grep 'CPU Temp'
        CPU Temp:  +45.5 C  (high =   +80 C, hyst =   +75 C)   sensor = thermistor
        CPU Temp:  +46.5 C  (high =   +80 C, hyst =   +75 C)   sensor = thermistor
        
        solfire:/home/mccramer>
        
        Script done on Sun May 28 17:15:52 2006

 Why can I execute the contents of the script "tempwatch" but not the
 script itsself?

 By the way: Does anyone know a trick how to remove _all_
 Escape-Sequences from a script generated by the command "script" ...
 "col -b" does not catch all.

 Keep hacking!
 Meino
