This is the current state of Debian:

The left column is ncurses compiled without --enable-widec , and the
right is ncursesw (--enable-widec).

I've heard some vague promises that the ncursesw packages will disappear
and that we'll have only the --enable-widec headers and libraries in
libncurses$num-dev.  If there are no ABI issues with this, I'd prefer it
happens as soon as possible.

Given my current understanding, if both ncurses{,w} -dev packages
installed, this will link against the wide library but use the non-wide
macros.  I assume this is harmless and equivalent to just linking
against the non-wide library.
