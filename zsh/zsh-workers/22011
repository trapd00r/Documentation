Hi!

I was disapointed the other day when the cvs completion didn't work.=20
After looking in to it I realized the reason was that I used the
switch -R, which now is only specified for certain platforms. But
nowadays this switch is available 'everywhere'. So I fixed that and
here is the utterly simple patch.

By the way, I'm not subscribed to the list.
