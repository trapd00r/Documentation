Yes, but how? The only `secure' change I can see is to update the
position of the mark if it is in $RBUFFER and only $LBUFFER is
changed. Otherwise we would need some, probably complicated, code to
check how $(|L|R)BUFFER was changed (ok, for deletion/insertion of
characters or short strings from/to the end/beginning of L/RBUFFER
this seems doable).

It's a bit like emacs' line-movement, isn't it?

(I always thought the mark should be either attached to a history line 
so that exchange-p-a-m would toggle between lines, or it should be
per-line. Maybe.)
