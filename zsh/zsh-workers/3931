Coprocesses are a bit of a mess.  I'd like to make it possible to attach
the coprocess to specified fd numbers, just like file redirections,
so that one could close either pipe with the ">&-" syntax.  This would
also make it possible to have multiple independent coprocesses.  To do
this properly I think we'd need an extended redirection syntax, to allow
redirecting file descriptors of more than one digit; perhaps we could
do something like the rc syntax?
