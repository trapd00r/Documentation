Oops.  Sorry.  That's because I generated the patch from RCS and patched
zsh-3.0.1 up to 3.0.2 to get the zsh-3.0.2 source tree.  patl was the
output of patch.

I'll repack the tar.gz.  I was told that
ftp://ftp.prz.tu-berlin.de/pub/unix/shells/zsh/ no longer mirrors zsh, in
the repacked archive it will be removed from the META-FAQ and from
zsh.texi.
