Subject: PATCH: choice of completers from _prefix
Date: Fri, 05 Dec 2003 11:24:49 +0100
Message-ID: <2212.1070619889@gmcs3.local>

When _prefix was changed to do better looping over completers,
_completer_num was declared local at the top and used for the looping.
Unfortunately, _main_complete's _completer_num is used below this point
to work out a completer list for when the style lookup fails.

The result is _prefix defaulting to all completers following the last
_prefix instead of those before the current.

The simple fix below is to move the local declaration.
