Whoops! How about plugging 's/[[:cntrl:]]/?g' into that instead?
: env | egrep '^(TERM|VISUAL|EDITOR|PS1)$' | sed 's/[[:cntrl:]]/?/g'

It is probably longer than you believe. typescript will also contain the 
normally invisible escape sequences that zsh sends to your terminal to 
tell it to erase the first cd /usr/src (which you won't see if you cat it.

Just make sure to run script, do the whole tab thing so that it won't 
erase the first "cd /usr/src", and then provide the literal version of 
that script. :)

Hm... you don't have infocmp. Do you have an /etc/termcap? If so, could 
you provide it (it's probably too large to put on list)?
