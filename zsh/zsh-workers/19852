Another one first spotted by Matthias Kopfermann:

schaefer<502> print ${(<TAB>
schaefer<502> print ${(Oops. Bug in parse_subst_string: errflag
Oops. Bug in parse_subst_string: errflag
Oops. Bug in parse_subst_string: errflag

I think it's a bogus oops (a debugging bug?) but there it is.

There's no completion for parameter expansion flags, yet, is there?  That
is, this shouldn't have been expected to work in any case?
