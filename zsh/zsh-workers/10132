Just a quick thought...

Hm. The wordcode files already store the complete pathnames used when
calling zcompile. That could be changed to prepend $PWD to names not
starting with a slash. Then we could change the patch for `autoload -w'
to make `autoload -w foo.zwc a b c' mark only a, b and c for
autoloading. And then we could make `autoload -mw foo.zwc "*/Completion/Debian/*"'
mark only those functions for autoloading.

I confess that I hadn't thought about combining wordcode files with a
package concept, although this now looks like a rather obvious idea...

Bye
 Sven
