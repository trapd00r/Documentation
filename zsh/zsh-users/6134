Subject: Simple prompt theme
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

I've made a simple prompt theme that displays "user@host:path>" by default 
in white but can accept up to two colors.  I use it with "cyan blue" but it 
looks good with "red yellow" too, maybe I shouldn't leave the default color 
white?  Anyway, it basically shows what the "redhat" and "suse" prompts do 
but in a way that still allows people to set colors to brighten up their 
prompt.  I'm not sure if I need this line, but the other themes seem to 
have it (now that's peer pressure!):
prompt_opts=( cr percent )

I hope it doesn't bother anyone if I paste it at the end of this email.  I 
could do a diff -u with an empty file but that doesn't make much sense.  I 
suppose it's a bit much of me to even think others might want to use it 
(but I'm proud of it), at least I didn't call it the dirus theme. ;)  I 
hope this is the right mailing list for it (I didn't know if I should post 
to workers or to users), and I hope no one minds the extra 2k in their inbox.

As it's name suggests, this prompt is designed to be small and to work
with all fonts, and yet still provide useful information.

This prompt is color-scheme-able.  You can invoke it thus:
   prompt simple [<text-color> [<punctuation-color>]]

The default color is just white and is intended to work on a black
background.  Simply use darker colors (such as black) for use on a
lighter background.
