For information, I cannot reproduce it here on a debian with the
same versions of the packages as Vincent's but on x86 (Vincent
is on powerpc according to bugs.debian.org/482346

It may be a good idea to check if the same can be observed with
other shells that use sigsuspend (pdksh, mksh) instead of
wait4/waitpid (bash, ksh93, posh, ash).

Note that both mksh and posh are meant to derive from pdksh. It
would be interesting to know why posh switched from sigsuspend
to wait4.
