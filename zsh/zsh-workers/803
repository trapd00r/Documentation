Zoltan> and libc-5.3.3,  with ncurses and with termcap with sr-bugfixed gcc-2.7.2.

Looks like the problem was my using libc-5.0.9.  I just upgraded to
libc-5.2.18, and the problem vanished, along with problems with some
other programs (interestingly, the common link seems to have been the
use of ncurses-1.9.8a....).

Sorry to waste your time on that one. <sigh>

One other problem/feature I noticed -- hzoli13 doesn't like to use =1,
=2, etc as identifiers to directories on the stack as I'm used to from
older versions.  Is this now not allowed, and ~1, ~2, etc preferred?
If so, I'd like to suggest a return to the =-style of referring to the
directory stack.

Thanks,
Danek
