I am not convinced, this is a nice idea. I nromally have host@$PWD as part of my
title bar (set in chpwd()). In this case zftp would reset it without ever
restoring back. This should at least be configurable (preferably, with zstyle
:-). Actually, users may have preexec() function that sets title bar to current
command being executed and precmd() that resets it back to some defaults after
command has completed. In this case your change will simply be a noop.
