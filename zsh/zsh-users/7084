Subject: Adding new completions to zsh

Hello,

I've written completion functions for the 'mktap' and 'twistd' command of 
the Twisted project, http://twistedmatrix.com and I would like advice on 
getting this functionality included in zsh.

The problem I'm facing is keeping the completions in zsh up-to-date.  
Twisted development happens at a fairly rapid pace and while command 
options aren't changing every day, in my judgement it would be annoying 
for our users (many of whom use zsh already) to be stuck with the static 
set of completion functionality bundled in any given zsh release.

My idea for allowing greater flexibility is to bundle the actual zsh 
completion functionality as part of the Twisted distribution and give zsh 
a "stub" that will use the completion functions that are bundled with 
Twisted.

Has anyone ever done this before? What do you all think?


	-Eric

P.S. maybey this should this be on zsh-dev, but I assume everyone reads 
zsh-users.
