Hi!

> It would be quite nice to have a couple of examples illustrating
> mailcap-prio-flags.

Some two examples I could think of, immediately :)

# From my .zshrc file. Prefers entries needing the terminal, then
# those using a display

'*needsterminal*' '*test=test -n "$DISPLAY"*' '*test=test "$DISPLAY" != ""*'

# This is probably good for a text-based terminal

'*needsterminal*' '*copiousoutput*'

I don't know of any non-standard flags in mailcap, except for
'priority', which is used by Debian's update-mime. If anyone knows
more of these non-standard flags, may be we can get better
examples.

Regards,
Ramkumar.
