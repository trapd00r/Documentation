    I dunno if this is any 'good' (from a technical zsh perspective), but
here's mine for 3.1.5.  May (not) work on 3.0.6.  Also have provided other
(really) simple ones which I've used.

compctl -g '*(-/) .*(-/)' cd    # what you want
compctl -g '*(/) .*(/)' rmdir
compctl -j -P % kill
compctl -j -P % fg
compctl -j -P % bg
compctl -u w
compctl -m whence
compctl -c which
compctl -c man
compctl -u who

    Flame away if any of them suck :).
