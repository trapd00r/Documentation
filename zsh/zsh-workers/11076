And what happens, when we add more (sub)directories? I suggest, that we
should simply use Completion/* Functions/* as default and move
everything, that is not to be installed by default in different
location.

BTW why we do not keep the same structure? I mean, sometimes we'll get
Completion/BSD and Functions/BSD ... and they clash by the installation.
