I don't understand what it's doing well enough to change.  It's trying
to handle multiple limits somehow.

Probably.

I realise, however, this is rather partial.  With some simple changes I
can make sure it prints and sets limits up to RLIM_NLIMITS as compiled
in, but the limits are stored in and set and read from an internal
array of that size, so limits beyond the end are more difficult and
need direct getrlimit/setrlimit handling.  So it will need improving.
