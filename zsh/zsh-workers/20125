 It normally informs you whenever a job becomes blocked so that
 no further progress is possible.  If the tt(NOTIFY) option is not set,
 it waits until just before it prints a prompt before it informs you.
+All such notifications are sent directly to the terminal, not to

 triggers any trap set for tt(CHLD).
