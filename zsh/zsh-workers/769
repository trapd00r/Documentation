zsh v. 2.6-beta13 on HP-UX A.09.01

1. The following binding doesn't work
  bindkey -v
  bindkey -a ':' execute-named-cmd

when I do <ESCAPE> and then ':', the named-cmd prompt is frozen.

2. Completion bug
  compctl -g '*' -S '\#' -x 'n[1,\\#]' -g '*' -- a

The completion on the second file is off by a character. I guess the
\\ is counted as two characters in the n[1,\\#] argument instead of one.

For instance, if there is a file called bozo in the current directory,
the following happens:

a bo<TAB>
    which completes to:  a bozo\#
a bozo\#<TAB>
    which doesn't do anything
a bozo\#zbo<TAB>
    which completes to:  a bozo\#zbozo

instead of
a bo<TAB>
    which completes to:  a bozo\#
a bozo\#bo<TAB>
    which completes to:  a bozo\#bozo
