} Uhh, yeah.

This bug is subtle, and I'm not sure how to fix it, and I can't spend
any more time on it tonight as I must get up very early tomorrow ...

The complication is that this:

foo() {
  <<-EOF
	This is a string
	EOF
}

gets converted internally into a REDIR_HERESTR, and so does the original
example with <<<.  But in the case of <<<, THE QUOTES ARE STILL PART OF
THE STRING, as \230 tokens.  For <<-, there are no quotes.  So when we
arrive in getredirs(), in the <<- case we need to insert quotes and then
call bslashquote(), but in the <<< case we only need to untokenize().

The only way to get this right is to know whether the original code was
really a here-string, or actually a full-fledged here-document; but
that information isn't passed down to getredirs() -- I'm not even sure
whether it's available in gettext2().

Otherwise we need to change the way <<< here-strings are parsed, so that
they're stored untokenized and with quotes stripped.
