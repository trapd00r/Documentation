The output that you attached was not from a clean compile -- there are
several steps missing in the "make" output, and the "configure" output
indicates that it is reading from a cache file.

Start over from scratch -- remove /data2/u2/work/ken/src/zsh/zsh-4.0.4/
and unpack the sources again -- and then get back to us if you're still
having a problem.
