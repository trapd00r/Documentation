Thanks, this is exactly what I was hoping for.  I hope this can go in
whether it happens to agree with bash in emacs mode or not --- most of the
comments about zsh (which is widely used here) I get are about little

be a big annoyance.  (The institute is just switching from 2.5 to 3.0,
so don't be surprised if there are more.)
