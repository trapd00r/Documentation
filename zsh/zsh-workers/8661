} I sent this to zsh-users and got no response. Can zsh-workers be a more
} appropriate group for the post?

zsh-users goes to zsh-workers, so we've now seen this twice.

Anyway, sorry for not replying sooner.  The doubled files in the tar are
a result of a bug in the "make ftp-dist" rule in the 3.0.[67] Makefiles,
which mentions both directory names (which tar recursively archives) and
individual filenames (which tar then archives *again*).

Since this doesn't cause any problems with the functioning of the resulting
zsh installation, it didn't seem to be important enough to fix until there
were enough other changes to necessitate 3.0.8 (or until it became clear
that there would be no 3.0.8, which might happen sooner).
