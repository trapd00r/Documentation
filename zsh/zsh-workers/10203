Hi Adam,

It has come to my attention through some of my former Borland associates
that you are looking for someone to house your CVS directories for zsh.
Being a big fan of the "Z shell", I would like to present you with
another option, OpenAvenue and OAsis.  Here at OpenAvenue we offer a
wide variety of services for the OSS developer, in addition to CVS, we
also offer web hosting, FTP services, email and discussion forums. (Just
to name a few...)  If you would like to see some of our pre beta work,
you can see what we are currently offering to the db.linux project,
http://www.openave.com/db.linux/.  If I can answer any questions or
assist you in any way please drop me a line.

Thanks,
~j
