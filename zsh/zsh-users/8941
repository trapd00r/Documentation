i wasn't skilled enought in zsh to understand those lines. thanks for
explains.

you're right : i've added .mutt/muttrc to the list and it works fine
now.

i've just seen in the mutt man that a system-wide configuration file
exists too : /etc/Muttrc

so, there are 3 configuration files :

~/.muttrc
~/.mutt/muttrc
/etc/Muttrc

well, the simplest way is to use an extern program that does it well :

lbdbq | sed -n '/alias/{s/\(^[^  ]\+\).*alias\(.*\)/\2:\1/;p}'

or something like that.

a pure zsh solution is trying to parse all files that are sourced (
using the source command ) by .muttrc.
