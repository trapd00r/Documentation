From: Peter Stephenson <pws@csr.com>

I've uploaded 4.1.0-dev-7 to ftp.zsh.org in the development directory
under the pub directory, from where it should spread to mirrors.

You might like the new replace-string widget and its pattern-matching
friend; see the zshcontrib manual page.  Most of the other changes seem
to be gradual additions to the completion system and bug fixes, some
quite embarrassing.  Small additions include print -C to specify the
number of columns and -a to specify printing across when using columns;
you can now `typeset -F SECONDS' to get greater granularity for time
measurements.

I'm finally getting started with organising my TCP function suite, which
is the only remaining large issue I know about which is likely to get
done before 4.1.1.
