It used to work though there were one or two bugs.  I'll be fixing it.

I used to have it so automargin didn't matter but it didn't work on about one
out of hundreds of terminal types (some type of xterm, SGI I think(?)).  And
it simplified the code by an enormous amount.  However, you can now use COLUMNS
to fake/force column width (what a bonus :-)
