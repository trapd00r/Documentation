I think you've got the right sort of idea.  However, parseMakefile can
run recursively, because it handles include declarations, so the
variables need to go in the top-level namespace.  There's no easy way of
ensuring this, unfortunately, since there's no way of making the
parameter local (necessary since the global parameter is special) but at
a particular level.  So I'll commit your patch for now.
