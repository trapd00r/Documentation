Here is what I have in the changelog from the source distribution of 
bash v2.0.3.

                                   10/6
                                   ----
aclocal.m4
        - change BASH_RLIMIT_TYPE so that it looks for rlim_t in
          <sys/resource.h> as well as <sys/types.h>, for Solaris 2.6
        - new macro, BASH_LARGE_FILE_SUPPORT, to enable special
          compilation options for large files on Solaris 2.6 (from
          eggert@twinsun.com)



I also have a problem with large file limits and was hoping that this
was the solution to my problem. But apparently not.
