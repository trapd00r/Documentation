} Hmm, now that I think about it, this _does_ make sense. Matter of fact,

} uses a custom variable to store invocation time of the shell

Hmm.  Actually you can get away with discarding all history entries with
history number <= than the original value of SAVEHIST (from *before* the
assignment SAVEHIST=$HISTSIZE in the edit_history function).  Assuming
that you haven't changed SAVEHIST since the last time the history file
was written, of course -- if you change SAVEHIST a lot you'll have to do
more work to get the startup-time maximum history number.

It's not particularly easy to discard those entries, though.  Probably
the best way is to put the "fc -W" in a subshell and truncate the history
there, like so:

    (
      # Needs recent-enough zsh to have HISTCMD
      if ((HISTCMD > histcmd_at_startup))
      then HISTSIZE=$((HISTCMD - histcmd_at_startup))
      fi
      fc -W
    )
