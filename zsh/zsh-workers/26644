Should the character set properties not be set by LC_CTYPE? As far as
I can tell LANG sets more than that? Do I understand correctly that
LANG is zsh-specific? (On my box, man 3 setlocale does not have it.)

At least emacs passes them through without ado. There's only one other
program that I had problems with in that respect. (That's unicode
only.) Looks like more will come...

Not that I know of.

Urban legends aside, this may be. Otoh... I've been using zsh since at
least 10 years almost exclusively and quite intensely and have used
8-bit-characters all the time (all on xterms), but any display
distortion never happened to me. This is probably due to the fact that
filenames are mostly under ones own control. I suffered display
distortion from reading emails though, but the shell could not have
done anything about that. Correctness of vt100-control-sequences
cannot be monitored either.

Therefore I think passing-through of eight bit characters should be
configurable. But I still do not understand how am I supposed to do
that (without triggering side effects). Why is PRINT_EIGHT_BIT
constricted to affect tab-completion only?
