i wrote it before but no reply.
it seems i am the only one who misses the ability to 
call macros like one normally does in vi with @.

again:

this macros begin with _ and a letter.

the ksh has it, the pdksh has it.
the zsh should have it!

also i miss the ability to record in emacs-mode with control-x (

besides the zsh is still a killer shell of course!
