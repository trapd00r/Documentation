Assuming you never want to use /? as a glob expression,

  alias -g '/?=/\?'

will fix that one.  This may well be a better answer than what you're
asking for, since otherwise commands like the one you show become
dependent on what's in the root directory.

I would suspect you don't need globbing at all with wget, if you use it
for standard purposes, in which case the usual workaround,

  alias wget='noglob wget'

whould be OK.  I can't offhand think of a reason you'd need to wget a
globbing expression, but that's without diving into the manual.

I can't think of any answers that give you more general control.
