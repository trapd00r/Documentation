wrt to the path what I do is blank out the PATH var and rebuild it  
based on directories I know tend to be available on the OSes I use  
(netbsd, freebsd, ubuntu, os x)

local temp_path
paths=( /bin /usr/bin /usr/pkg/bin /usr/local/bin /sbin /usr/sbin /usr/ 
local/sbin /usr/pkg/sbin /usr/X11R6/bin /usr/games /opt/local/bin /opt/ 
local/sbin ~/bin)
for temp_path in $paths
do
     if [[ -d $temp_path ]]
     then
       if [[ $PATH == "" ]]
       then
         PATH=$temp_path
       else
         PATH=$PATH:$temp_path
       fi
     fi
done
unset paths temp_path

this way I keep my path tidy and zsh doesn't bother looking in dirs  
that don't exist.
