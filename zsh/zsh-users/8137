    Hi Oliver :)

    OK, now I understand. If I use $PREFIX and '-M', that won't work,
am I right? If I use $PREFIX I should use too :t or something similar
so it affects the globbing pattern but not the matching mechanism of
compadd, right?

    Nice :)) I want coloring in the matching list, so I'll keep -f.

    Now I understand, right. I was confused by the manual and deduced
that -W affected the matching.

    Thanks a lot for your kind and useful explanation :)
