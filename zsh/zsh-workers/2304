It doesn't work for me:

bash$ echo $BASH_VERSION 
1.14.6(1)
bash$ echo -e -n
bash$ 

`-e' in bash is used to enable interpretation of control sequences
like \n.

       echo [-neE] [arg ...]
              Output the args, separated by spaces.   The  return
              status is always 0.  If -n is specified, the trail-
              ing newline is suppressed.  If  the  -e  option  is
              given,  interpretation  of the following backslash-
              escaped characters is enabled.  The -E option  dis-
              ables  the  interpretation  of these escape charac-
              ters, even on systems where they are interpreted by
              default.
[... list of control sequences snipped ...]

As far as I can see, no way is described to print `-n'.
