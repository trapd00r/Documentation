    Hi David :)

    Obvious ;) That's a good bunch of files to delete ;))

    I'm not quite sure, but I think you can raise the limit on
argument list length :????

    The easier is find+xargs. 'find' will feed the filenames
(-print0 is your friend here if you have 'strange' names) to xargs,
which will process them a handful at a time.

    Of course, I may miss some point here, I'm not a Zsh gurú.
