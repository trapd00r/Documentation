It's not differences between long and short.  It's caused by the
difference between traditional getopt and GNU getopt.

By default, GNU getopt permutes argv and finds options on anywhere
(until `--').

If we can easily find out whether a command is linked with GNU getopt
or not, we can (and should) complete correctly.

But I think the current behavior is not bad because it completes all
correct (and some non-correct) candidates.  If _arguments behavior is
changed as you said, it completes only subset of correct candidates.
