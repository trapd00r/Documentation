} Is there anything that ought to go in /etc/z* on more machines than,
} say, those in a single company?

I've always asserted that there is not, with the possible exception of
default path settings in /etc/zshenv.

As of the zsh-3.0.5-6 RPM, which shipped with RH6, the /etc/zlogin and
/etc/zprofile files contained only comments, /etc/zlogout contained the
"clear" command, and /etc/zshenv set $X11HOME and the path.  This is all
fine.  However, /etc/zshrc contained aliases and bindkeys, which has
always annoyed me.
