Definitely :-(

Here is a stack trace without gettext in it:

A deadlock with free() this time.

Here is more information about how to reproduce these deadlocks:

Download a snapshot of gsh:
http://repo.or.cz/w/gsh.git?a=3Dsnapshot;h=3D9a90d28f9ad0e64c45202522b26ff6=
c13f10f795;sf=3Dtgz

Run this loop:

while : ; do ./gsh.py --command=3D: localhost localhost localhost; done

This assumes that running 'ssh localhost' will lead you to a Zsh
instance. This should accumulate deadlocked Zsh processes that you can
see with: pstree -a -h -p -u $USER|grep '^zsh,'|cut -d, -f2

I don't think it's the first time I saw hung Zsh processes, but this
commit in my gsh software made the problem appears more easily:

http://repo.or.cz/w/gsh.git?a=3Dcommitdiff;h=3D9a90d28f9ad0e64c45202522b26f=
f6c13f10f795

It replaces builtin echo invocations with actual /bin/echo forkings.

Hope that helps.
