If you are using a saved history each time you start a zsh session the old 
history gets imported. The numbering continues. You can use old event numbers 
in you new session if you like.

There are some options how you can control the history behavior. 
http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Options.html#SEC105

Furthermore zsh has the ability to share it's history across multiple running 
sessions. Each command get's it's own event number. You can recall the command 
with event number 123 entered in zsh session 1 from zsh session 2 by using the 
history command "!123".
