It is a FreeBSD system but no matter.

I thought the new completion was compatible with the old one (i.e. having
compctl would still work).

I have uncommented this line but the old mutt completion rule still doesn't
work.

Now, I just found that what I used to make completion case-independent (see
below) doesn't work anymore. With dev-16 it was still working.

compctl -M 'm:{a-z}={A-Z} m:{A-Z}={a-z}'

Now, I can't complete independantly of the case :-(
