Until the mirrors start catching up (i.e. probably tonight) I have
zsh-3.1.5.tar.gz for anyone in Europe with a pressing desire at

http://www.ifh.de/~pws/computing/zsh-3.1.5.tar.gz

(sorry, don't have anonymous FTP).  It takes an age to get from
Australia.

Anyone using Zoltan's patch for dynamic loading on AIX will need to
apply a few bits by hand, but will also need to add the line

  zsh_cv_sys_dynamic_broken="${zsh_cv_sys_dynamic_broken=no}"

just after various other similar lines in the `if test "x$aixdyanamic"
= xyes' part of configure.in before running autoheader and autoconf.
Otherwise it still appears to work, at least on AIX 3.2.5.
