This does break the existing function,

% typeset -T FOO foo
% foo=(bar rod)
% typeset -R 15 FOO
% print $FOO
        bar:rod

and (unless you've taken special steps to fix it) you run the risk of
the ct element being used for both when you request `typeset -R 15 FOO'.

However, you only need eight bits (until we have wide characters, which
is another future nightmare) and ct is at least 32, so it's
tantalising...

I would be tempted to add -S as a single flag now and wait until we have
a better (virtual) interface to the parameters, then add a more
general flag.  As Oliver says, a different option letter would be more
appropriate for the general case anyway.

Eventually, I'd like struct param to become opaque to code outside
params.c and use something like a single (vtable-style) pointer for
type-specific bits.
