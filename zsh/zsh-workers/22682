Will changing getkeystring() break anything?

> zsh's builtin printf fails to interpret two-digit octal escape, such as '\1'

> 
> zsh% printf '\33abc' | hd
> 00000000  5c 33 33 61 62 63                                 |\33abc|
> 00000006

> On the other hand, the printf from textutils handles them:

> $ /usr/bin/printf '\33abc' | hd
> 00000000  1b 61 62 63                                       |.abc|
