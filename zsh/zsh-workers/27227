Seems like sf.net decided to change the URI of its git repositories a
little. A change such as the following (to .git/config) should get
your existing local repositories up to speed:

[snip]
--- config~ 2009-06-19 16:39:27.000000000 +0200
+++ config  2009-08-21 11:26:58.000000000 +0200

    bare = false
    logallrefupdates = true
 [remote "origin"]
-   url = git://zsh.git.sf.net/gitroot/zsh
+   url = git://zsh.git.sf.net/gitroot/zsh/zsh
    fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
 [branch "master"]
    remote = origin
[snap]

So, if you'd like to make a fresh clone of the repository the
appropriate command now is:
    % git clone git://zsh.git.sf.net/gitroot/zsh/zsh
