Does anyone know whether bogofilter has been considered?  I've been
using both it and spamassassin for a few months and getting far
superior results from bogofilter (but it does require some training
before identifying anything at all).  It's also reputed to be much
faster, although I haven't tried comparing speeds.  A number of people
on the spamassassin list running high volume servers have complained
about its resource usage.
