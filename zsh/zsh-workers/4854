This applies to 3.1.5-pws-3 and -pws-4 -- not before that, I think.

./zsh -f
% set a b c d e
% print $*
a b c d e
% print $argv[2,4]
b
%

Basically, for any ${arrayname[start,stop]} zsh now seems to ignore the
comma and everything after it, such that the expression becomes exactly
equivalent to ${arrayname[start]}

An interesting feature.
