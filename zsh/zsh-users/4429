Folks,

I have a two-line Eterm displayed most of the time, which doesn't
display the RPROMPT (%~). If I resize the Eterm to two or more lines,
the RPROMPT reappears.
I tried to change PROMPT_CR (there's a FAQ item that sounds similar),
but to no avail.

Is it Eterm's fault? How can the RPROMPT be displayed?

tia
Thorsten
