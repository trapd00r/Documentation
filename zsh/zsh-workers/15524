CPUTYPE is uname -p IIRC, it hardly warrants extra parameter.

VENODR is very unlikely. System vendors change rapidly (what is now
ReliantUNIX was (is being) owned by Nixdorf, Siemens Nixdorf, Siemens,
Fujitsu Siemens), but VENDOR is still `sni'. Changing VENDOR every time
ownership changes clearly defeats its purpose, but companies hardly agree on
declaring obsolete names.

ERRNO is way too Unix specific; other systems may not have concept of errno
or even system calls.
