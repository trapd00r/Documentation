is there any way to make expansion of the directory name (using $_) work
properly with Maildir folders?

from the zsh man page under "mailpath":

   The message  will  undergo parameter expansion, command substitution
   and  arithmetic  expansion  with  the variable  $_  defined  as the
   name of the file that has changed.

however if i put:
mailpath=($HOME/Maildir\?"New mail." ~/mail/\?"New mail in $_. ")

in my .zshrc,
the message I get is:

New mail in path.

Same if i do something like:
mailpath=($HOME/Maildir\?"New mail." ~/mail/ndn:cron\?"New mail in $_.")

zugzug% echo $ZSH_VERSION
4.0.4

am i doing something wrong? if not, is there a way to make this work
anyway?
