I have a vague feeling there were things which later got moved to
CSH_JUNKIE_PAREN because they caused some problem with some strange sh
syntax.  However, the patch looks fairly clean and I can't see how any
valid sh syntax would fail.  Maybe the expedient of treating (..) and
{..} the usual way has fixed things up.  If I was more energetic I
would look back in the list archive.

I've got lost along the way somewhere.  I thought CSH_JUNKIE_PAREN
(which I originally wrote some time ago) was once supposed to do that?
Otherwise what was the big deal?  If zsh has never treated the
parentheses as a test, why was it advertised as a csh-compatibility
feature?  If it did, why was it taken out?
