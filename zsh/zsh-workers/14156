Yes, the option kshglob is the one at the point of compilation.  This is
pretty much unavoidable in this case --- things like @(foo|bar) behave
completely differently in the two cases and it's just not worth compiling
it both ways on the off chance.  With globsubst, the only question is
tokenisation, and it's easy to make sure the pattern code is independent of
that (there were some glitches in that but I think they've gone).

But I still think precompiling patterns is OK as long as you do it at the
point of first use.  The difficult case

% unsetopt kshglob
% testpat() { setopt kshglob; [[ $1 = @(aardvark|bison) ]]; }

will always work so long as the pattern is compiled at that point.

I believe syntactic structures no longer get copied to be executed, so that
ought to be able to work.
