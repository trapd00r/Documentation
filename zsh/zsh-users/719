*I* still use a "text-only" system.  Almost everyday I use the
a DEC vt220.  A bit slow because it only does 9600bps reliably, but
still useful.  At the University Computer Club, UWA, we've got about
seven in the clubroom.  Do they get used?  its often tough to find
one free...

someone's donating a couple of DEC vt320's to us in the next couple
of days.  I'm hoping they handle 19200 acceptably. (vt220's handle
it, but every n'th character gets corrupted.)

anyway, I'm sure there are millions of people just like us living
off the donated equipment of the more fortunate.

BTW, if anyone wants to donate an old SMD controller, we have a 
Sun 3/280 in need :)

Orr would be crazy to fly more missions and sane if he didnt, but if he was sane
he had to fly them.  If he flew then he was crazy and didn't have to; but if he
didn't want to he was sane and had to.  Yossarian was moved deeply and let out a
respectful whistle at the absolute simplicity of this clause of Catch-22. --jh
