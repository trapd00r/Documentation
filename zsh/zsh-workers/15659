Probably _man_pages and a few others should get the treatment meted out
to helper functions in _cvs, namely defining the function only if
$functions[_man_pages] is not defined.  That would save all the copying
of unnecessary bits.

By the way, I'll be away for a week from tomorrow since, unfortunately,
I have to go to a meeting on the French Rieviera.  (I shall also be away
for the week two weeks after that.)
