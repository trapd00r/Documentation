It should matter less than it used to.  It now respects the search
order, but looks for curses anyway.  The potential problem is that
it will find symbols in both libraries and get into difficulties
linking with both.

I'm not sure how much we actually need to prefer the termcap library,
anyway.  On most systems now this is just a kludged-up subset of
curses where it exists at all.  However, I don't really know why
the choice was necessary in the first place --- maybe it was just
caution.
