Forgot to reply to this yesterday...

I'd like to ask again if we should make the completion system *not*
use $fignore any more -- everything it can do can also be done with
the ignored-suffixes style. And we have already superseeded other
parameters with styles.

Also, we could think about making this more powerful. E.g. we could
make compadd use the strings it gets with the -F option as patterns so 
that we are not restricted to only suffixes (although the suffix test
is faster, of course, but we could still handle simple patterns of the 
form `*<str>' in the same way we use those strings now). And we could
make those patterns be used for all types of matches and turn the
ignored-suffixes style into a ignored-strings style that is set in
_description. Would be quite simple, actually.

Bye
 Sven
