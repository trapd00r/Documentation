Try something like this:

ls -al | more && cat ~/.zshrc | grep setopt

Now if you're done with pipeline 1 ( ls -al | more ), its exit status
says whether or not to run pipeline 2 (cat ~/.zshrc | grep setopt).
If you kill the "more" process (so it doesn't exit with code 0), the
second pipeline will not be executed.

HTH,
Thomas
