Zsh completion system should work without LD_PRELOAD.  But is there a
reason that the system automatically detect LD_PRELOAD and use it only
when it is working?  Of couse, if there is no way to detect that, it
should be disabled by default.

Writing a completion function which supports various versions of a
command is very difficult.  (See _patch, _telnet, _finger, _make,
etc.)  So I think it is useful even if it is not work on every
environment.

Also, it may be useful for writing template of completion functions if
a completion function writer can use LD_PRELOAD. :-)
