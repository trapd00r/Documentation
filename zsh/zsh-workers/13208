Here's a followup note:

I built the zsh-3.0.8 release and it executed without error.

I'm not sure why the 3.1.2 and the 3.1.9 executables that I
built did not work.  If there is any information that I can
pass on to you to help, please let me know; otherwise, I'll
stick with the 3.0.8 version for awhile!

Thanks,
