So my question is still open:

Consider the following command:
ls -tr -dl *(om[1,30])

Now I would like to create an alias/or a function/or whatever to make
the * variable.

I'd like to call:
lsnew *
lsnew a*


Is there an easy way to do it in zsh?

The only idea that I have at the moment is to create a script on the
fly and execute it.

Other ideas?



Stefan.
