This seems to indicate that TAB has been bound to a function that was
installed as a normal widget rather than as a completion widget (via
"zle -C"), although I would have expected things to fail a lot sooner
in that event.  What output do you get from

bindkey ^I

(that is, bindkey with only one argument, which is caret capital eye)?

What do you get if, instead of TAB, you type control-X question-mark
after the equal sign?
