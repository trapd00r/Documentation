Yes, this could happen. Thanks for reporting. Obviously, fixing the code
is the superior solution. However, I'd like to do it universally for all
of `vcs_info' and not only for the invocation of "svn info".

The reason for that is because we're using the command roughly like
this:  ${command} ...

And when sh_split_word isn't set (which it isn't by default and vcs_info
uses mostly zsh defaults), the parameter isn't split, like it would in
other bourne-like shells.

I think it would be best to leave it as it is; but I don't feel strongly
about it. If a lot be people think we should split that parameter, we
could do that (even though it might break backwards compatibility for
some people).


Anyway, could you try the following patch for the locale problem? I
think it should solve the issue once and for all.

This is to avoid problems with output from external commands with non-C
locales as reported by Fran=C3=A7ois Gannaz in workers-27900.
