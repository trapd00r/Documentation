Subject: Upgrade of reference card

I just discovered the very useful reference card on the zsh-site. It's
very good, but doesn't seem to have been upgraded to version 4.0.x. Are
there any plans to do this? I'm not in the position to be much help with
this, being a quite newly converted zsh-user, but perhaps someone else
is?

Jesper
