Subject: Writing completion for option taking comma-separated list of filenames

Hi!

So mkisofs' -B option takes a comma-separated list of filenames to use
for sun4X boot-images and I was wondering how to handle that in a
completion function.  I need something like "_values -s , ...", but
with filenames instead of fixed values.

Thanks.
