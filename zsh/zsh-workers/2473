Now that the texinfo documentation is up to date I would like to ask every
developers sending documentation patches to include a patch for zsh.texi as
well.  Texinfo is very useful as it can be used to produce very nice
printed manual (with table of contents and indexes) and it can be converted
into html which is recently getting more and more importand (I heard that
in the next Solaris release all manual will be written in SGML).

Thanks,

Zoltan
