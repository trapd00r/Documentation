Hi,

sorry I have to bother you yet again, but I have two more problems  
left that I couldn't solve with the zsh documentation:

1. Is there a way in zsh to pass the standard output to a parameter 
   instead of the standard input of a command? I.e. I have

      command1 | command2 parameter

   and need the output of command1 as the parameter for command2

2. How do I pipe the elements of an array into a command? If I do a

      echo $ARRAY | command

   the elements are separated only by whitespace instead of newlines 
   which will not work correctly especially if the elements possibly
   contain whitespace themselves. It works, of course, with a for-do
   loop but that's not efficient enough.

Thank you very much for every hint!


                Bye
                        Uli
