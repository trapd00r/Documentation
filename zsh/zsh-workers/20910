No, that doesn't work either.  The error is from returning -1 from
    	    	    cd = iconv_open(nl_langinfo(CODESET), "ISO-10646");

This fails too, but with the slightly odd error "invalid universal
character name".  It's not a problem with the input format, however,
since that complains about missing hexadecimal digits if you get it wrong.

This gives US-ASCII, which might be part of the problem, though I really
haven't the faintest idea.  A quick scan of the regional and language
settings didn't suggest anything.
