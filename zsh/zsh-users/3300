If you investigate shell-script-mode in recent versions of GNU emacs, you'll
find that it does in fact classify zsh as a derivative of ksh88 and attempt
to handle it that way (e.g. it'll recognize #!/bin/zsh and automatically
start shell-script-mode, etc.)  It's got most of the list of keywords right,
knows how to insert loop skeletons, etc.

I have no idea whether XEmacs has this yet.
