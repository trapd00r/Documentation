I didn't quite get this, when I first read your mail, sorry. Does this
mean, history saving does work for you on other operating systems? If
so, my babbling here is useless. :-)
See Bart's reply then.

As for the default values:

[snip]
% zsh -fc 'print -$SAVEHIST- -$HISTSIZE- -$HISTFILE-'
-0- -30- --
[snap]

If you set HISTFILE and HISTSIZE, that's fine (and for HISTFILE it's
even required); As you can see however, $SAVEHIST is 0 by default,
which means, nothing will be saved.
