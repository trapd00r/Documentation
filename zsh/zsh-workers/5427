Just thinking: suppose we had a convention where if $COMPSKIP was non-empty
at any stage, the driver functions (principally __main_complete and
__normal) would stop generating matches at that point, unset COMPSKIP, and
return?  That would act like -tn with ordinary compctl's.

Btw, would it be better to rename AUTODUMP to COMPAUTODUMP to have a
consistent prefix?
