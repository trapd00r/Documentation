Thanks, this is always useful to know.

It seems to be OK with the latest version (lots of errors, of course,
but no damage), but I can get the crash with the tip of the 4.2 branch.
It seems to be doing something wayward in (what looks to it like) a
complicated pattern match.  If I get a chance I'll try to work out what
fixed it, but it could be complicated since the pattern code has changed
quite a lot owing to adding multibyte support.  It's quite possibly a
simple error to do with metafication; a number of those turned up along
the way.
