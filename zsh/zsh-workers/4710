I've been doing this, but quite deliberately haven't posted messages
about it to zsh-users, since it's really for people who are involved
in the discussions on zsh-workers.  The official zsh-3.1.x releases
are in any case betas, it didn't seem a good idea to spread the dirty
washing out any further.  It's at

http://www.ifh.de/~pws/computing/zsh-3.1.5-patched.tar.gz

It's a couple of weeks old and I'll probably update it once more
before Christmas (I have a large module which I'm going to post before
then).
