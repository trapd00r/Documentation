I've tried "_arguments -s -w", but this is even worse.

Both "dvips -P[Tab]" and "dvips -P [Tab]" should complete on the
printer names, but "dvips -Pfoo" and "dvips -P foo" should complete
on the dvi files (or another option).

"dvips -j[Tab]" should add a space, because the -j option doesn't
take any data.

"dvips -j [Tab]" should complete on the dvi files (or another option).
