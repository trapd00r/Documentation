              ^^^
Note, that the brace was (re)inserted at the old place. If I now try to insert
something with accept-and-menu-complete, it will correctly insert the
``s/bin/zsh-xxx'' - but, it is rather unexpected. And, users will probably
expect, that they simply can type in ``,zsh.old,zsh-what-ever}'' - and this does
not work any more.
