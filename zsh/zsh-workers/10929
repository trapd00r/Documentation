} Maybe we could change the C code to do the same the shell code does
} now. I.e.: we turn LISTMAX back into a integer, remove the `scroll'
} special value and turn list scrolling on only if $LISTPROMPT is set.

Would you then also remove the SELECTSCROLL variable and turn on select
scrolling only if SELECTPROMPT is set?

It'd be better than the current situation, I think.  As for "happy":

} It would also make $LISTPROMPT more like $SELECTPROMPT: not set = no
} prompt.

Not set == _main_complete sets them for you.  (Or at least that's what
happens now.)  That's the bit I don't like:  The variables are documented,
but unless you also set a style they get clobbered.

} One idea might be to add something that allows to turn on menu
} selection when the list doesn't fit on the screen.

If we did this, could we -replace- scrolling of listings with it, and get
rid of LISTPROMPT entirely?
