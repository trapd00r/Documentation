/etc/zones/index isn't a public interface.  You should use "zoneadm list"
to get the list of zones instead.

I submitted a completion function for zlogin a short while back (July 21).
That should either be rolled into this file, or the _zlogin() here should
be dropped -- I think that mine is more accurate, though I don't complete
the zonename.
