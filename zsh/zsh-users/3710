} so how can I get zsh to find it and use it?

First, try using TERM=color_xterm instead, and see if that doesn't fix
you up.  Sometimes /etc/termcap has color_xterm but not xterm-color.

Then, if that works, try to find out why zsh is using termcap when it
ought to be using terminfo.  Did you build zsh yourself, or was it
installed by a sysadmin?

(The error message you quoted always says "termcap" when it can't find a
terminal definition, even when using terminfo.)
