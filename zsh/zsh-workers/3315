Aehem, to add to my own remark:

I've had the time now to look in the docs and found there is a  
NEXTSTEP equivalent to isprint, called NXIsPrint.

So obviously all that needs to be done is to make zsh use an  
alternative isprint and then use NXIsPrint for it (or "write" an  
alternative isprint that wraps NXIsPrint).

How could this be integrated in the source?


                Bye
