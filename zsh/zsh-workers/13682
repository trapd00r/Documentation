} I wouldn't be against that, I just wouldn't know what style to suggest:
} one for all, one for each directory

Probably which of these works best depends on whether memory mapping is
available.

} So far, we have already mentioned [slowness from] _approximate and
} _correct (I still haven't got round to figuring out the difference
} between the two), and match specs.

The difference is that _correct won't treat the word on the line as a
substring of a longer match; it just tries to find matching character
permutations within the existing word.

} (Incidentally there are some rough edges with the caching mechanism
} which I *still* haven't got round to smoothing.)

_perl_modules is a good example of such roughness, because perl can be
invoked by a large number of almost-synonymous names including names
with version numbers.  I tried to make it do something sensible, but
I'm not entirely happy with the result.

} Anything else?

Any completion that uses _call is potentially slow, of course.  Maybe
we ought to be caching the _is_gnu association, too.
