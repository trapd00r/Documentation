Here's some that still seem to affect 4.2.1-test-A.

#134474 - tsetcap is based on short term instead of SINGLE_LINE_ZLE
#258431 - doesn't complete .iso files for cdrecord.
#261775 - remote rsync completion needs escaping a la scp completion
#256789 - brace completion commas aren't escaped (17791, 17913, 17926)
