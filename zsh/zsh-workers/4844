I was just about to put together another development version when I
discovered this.

% foo=(a b)
% foo[1]=c
zsh: not an identifier: foo[1]

which is quite serious, because my functions use this all the time, so
I'll have to wait until it's fixed.  I would guess the problem is with
4826, fixing subscripts for associative arrays.
