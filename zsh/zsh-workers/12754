This is a completely different matter.  The subshell inherits everything
from the parent shell after the fork; it never re-initialiases.  It does
unset the options MONITOR and USEZLE, but not INTERACTIVE, for the
subshell, however.   One might have thought that it would either change all
three or none.  In particular, the effect of claiming to be interactive but
not using ZLE looks a bit weird.  Unless there is some standard behind
this?
