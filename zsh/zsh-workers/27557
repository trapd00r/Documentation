What I meant was literally just doing
'-a[amplitude]:integer 1-20:'

There are precedents for either way though,
Completion/X/Command/_xv:  '-preset:default preset (1-4):(1 2 3 4)' \
Completion/X/Command/_x_utils:    '-mod:x grid distance (1-16): :y
grid distance (1-16)' \

(the latter is for xsetroot)
