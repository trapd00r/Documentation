I'd think that this whole branch of the logic becomes unnecessary with
"$@", but if it is still needed then just put "$@" afterwards.

A shell script's parameters are available in $@ / $* and in zsh in
$argv.

With parameters:
 alpha
 foo bar
 wibble

then:
 "$*" == 'alpha foo bar wibble'
 "$@" == 'alpha' 'foo bar' 'wibble'

(ie, _most_ times that you see $* in a script it's a bug, normally "$@"
 is what's needed)

See zshparam(1), "POSITIONAL PARAMETERS" section.
