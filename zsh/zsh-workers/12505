} And this tries to clarify it a bit more. The docs are IMHO still misleading -
} at least, I get impression that consecuitive whitespaces between words are
} eliminated. That is not the case:
} 
} bor@itsrm2% read foo
}   bar   baz
} bor@itsrm2% print %$foo%
} %bar   baz%

This happens only when "leftover fields [are] assigned to the last name."
It's consistent with bash.  Ash preserves both the inter-field AND the
trailing whitespace in that circumstance, which would lead me to guess
that the original Bourne `read' doesn't strip trailing whitespace.
