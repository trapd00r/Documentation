} No, it was there long before. I suspect, that tests were never run on a

Does this patch fix it?  Unfortunately $(DLLD) is the only reasonable
symbol to test that is available in Test/Makefile; $(LIBZSH) is defined in
Src/Makefile.in only.  So this may needlessly export LD_LIBRARY_PATH on a
system that does not require libzsh, but that should be harmless, right?
