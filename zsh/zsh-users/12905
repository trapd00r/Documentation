Thanks. I didn't even notice the bottom quote from your previous email 
until I just reread it, but "Jan 16th" got me there.

I don't see the advantage or difference yet (except the "on a different 
level" part -- the 'screen' way makes more sense to me at this point).

Perusing the previous thread made me wonder: Is there a solution for the 
problem of needing co-operation from, say, the X Window manager? Or have 
you settled on being able to pass in a dead/killed shell's UUID/GUID?

(Is there an alternate interface to the online mailing list archive, btw? 
I hate all the clicking around -- I'd rather download an .mbox file and 
use it in Alpine.)

Huh. Never had that happen to me. Good to know.

But, won't this also be a problem with whatever mechanism you're 
envisioning? Or is this beyond the scope of what you'd want your "thing" 
to do (re-attaching already-running programs)?

Best,
Ben
