    Hi Bart :)

    Maybe, but it works. At least it works as I consider 'the
intuitive way'. If I specify two or more arrays, what I want is the
whole list as a source of matches, mixed.

    Thanks again for the patch :) By now I'll use my old 4.0.9 and
two compadd commands, until 4.2.2 is out there.
