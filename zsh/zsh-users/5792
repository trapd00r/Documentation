Karsten held off the qconfirm stuff in the past precisely because of
Andrej's concern with the zsh-users -> zsh-workers forwarding and I've
heard nothing to indicate that it has been solved. Mails since sometime
on Saturday have carried an X-MessageWall-Score header so it seems like
MessageWall is in place. I'd suggest we give that a chance before
further hassling of the people at sunsite.dk. Otherwise I can ask
Karsten about qconfirm.
