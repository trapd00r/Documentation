Hi,

Running zsh 3.0 on Next 3.2 shows slow painting of the prompt on the very first  
line of a newly opened shell window. I can see the cursor beginning on the left  
and move like a very fast typewriter.

On following occasions something seems to have been cached as it is not  
perceivable any more.

I did 'unset RPROMPT RPS1'. That helps as described above.
If not, the performance stays the same as on first occasion.

Maybe this helps
Juergen
