Hi Charles,
If you'd like the line editor to beep, you'll have to add a widget
that does that. I don't think that there's an option for that.
Try:

backward-delete-char-beep() {
  if (( CURSOR == 0 )) ; then
    zle beep ;
  fi ; 
  zle backward-delete-char
}
zle -N backward-delete-char-beep
bindkey "^?" backward-delete-char-beep

That should do the trick.

Regards, Frank
