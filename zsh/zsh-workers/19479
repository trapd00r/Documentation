    Hi Peter :)

 * Peter Stephenson <pws@csr.com> dixit:
> This seems to remove the warning message if pcre is found.

    Just to make sure: is zsh-4.2.x dependent on PCRE or is it
optional? I don't have PCRE installed (nor intentions to do so) but I
would like to upgrade to 4.2.x (specially if no more 4.0.x releases
will be done).
 
    Thanks :)
