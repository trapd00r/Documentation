[patch...]

    I'm trying it against a 4.2.1 (although I use 4.0.9), default
modules configuration, and it doesn't work :((

    If there isn't a WORD in the command line (apart for the command,
of course) and I hit TAB (bound to my special expand or complete),
I'm presented with the list of all named dirs (first) and user dirs
(last). That's correct because I specify 'compadd -k nameddirs
userdirs'. But if I use, for example 'cd r<TAB>', nothing is
completed, and userdirs has an entry for 'root' which should match :(

    If you want me to try anything more or if you want any info about
my environment or whatever, just tell.

    Thanks for your help and interest, Bart, you're great ;) As we
say in Spain, you're a 'tío de puta madre' ;)
