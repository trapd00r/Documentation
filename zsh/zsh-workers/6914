The reason I  didn't like sourcing compinit was that I hate to have any
dependencies on local installation place. Making it autoloaded function makes it
invariant:

autoload compinit; compinit

As I finally pointed out, there are other ways. One possibility is to define
parameter (say, COMPINIT) that holds full pathname of compinit (if it was
installed). In this case you could use

[[ -n "$COMPINIT" ]] && source "$COMPINIT"

I don't actualy care which one is used.

Hmmm ... in command line editing multiline input I can insert new line by
pressing ^V^J.
