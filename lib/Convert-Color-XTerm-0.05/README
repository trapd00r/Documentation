NAME
    "Convert::Color::XTerm" - indexed colors used by XTerm

SYNOPSIS
    Directly:

     use Convert::Color::XTerm;

     my $red = Convert::Color::XTerm->new( 1 );

    Via Convert::Color:

     use Convert::Color;

     my $cyan = Convert::Color->new( 'xterm:14' );

DESCRIPTION
    This subclass of Convert::Color::RGB8 provides lookup of the colors that
    xterm uses by default. Note that the module is not intelligent enough to
    actually parse the XTerm configuration on a machine, nor to query a
    running terminal for its actual colors. It simply implements the colors
    that are present as defaults in the XTerm source code.

    It implements the complete 256-color model in XTerm. This range consists
    of:

    *   0-7: The basic VGA colors, dark intensity. 7 is a "dark" white, i.e.
        a light grey.

    *   8-15: The basic VGA colors, light intensity. 8 represents a "light"
        black, i.e. a dark grey.

    *   16-231: A 6x6x6 RGB color cube.

    *   232-255: 24 greyscale ramp.

CONSTRUCTOR
  $color = Convert::Color::XTerm->new( $index )
    Returns a new object to represent the color at that index.

METHODS
  $index = $color->index
    The index of the XTerm color.
