} Any option setting that caused your problems?

Try using 'zstyle -e' to put glob patterns in $reply in a context where
they will actually later be used as glob patterns, such as in the
file-patterns style.  The problem isn't that zstyle -e can't return
them, but that it returns them incorrectly metafied (I think).
