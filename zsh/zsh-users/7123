Subject: Installing ZSH Info Manual in OS X?
Date: Sat, 6 Mar 2004 18:22:51 -0500
X-Mailer: Apple Mail (2.612)

Hi, I'm running the Fink install of zsh 4.1.1 on OS X 10.3.2, and I'd 
like to get the nice hierarchical info manual I've seen on linux 
systems. (I currently have only the flat, multi-part man page manual, 
and I'm getting really tired of grepping it for the glob references.) 
How do I do this? I found the info manual tarball at the website, but I 
have no idea how to install it.
