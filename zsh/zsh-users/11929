these do what i'd expect:
  ls ./*(.)    # list all regular files in the current dir
  ls *(.)      # list all regular files in the current dir
  grep foo ./*(.)    # grep 'foo' from regular files in the current dir

this doesn't:
  grep foo *(.)

can anyone explain that?

zsh 4.3.4 (amd64-portbld-freebsd6.2)
