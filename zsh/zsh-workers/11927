It simply gives up.

With `a{b,c}<TAB>' the completion code would have to generate the
matches for `ab' and `ac', then built the intersection to get the
suffixes (and prefixes if there's a suffix, i.e. the middle-strings)
which are in both sets (in all n sets, actually). And that mey be
combined with arbitrarily complicated match specs. Frightening.

Or have I missed something?
