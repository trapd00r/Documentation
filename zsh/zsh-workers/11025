Okay, that makes sense, sorry. I'll shut-up about CVS until I know what
I'm talking about now.

On the subject of releases (as opposed to CVS revisions), what is the
situation with 3.0.8? If I haven't missed something, Bart only made a
preliminary release for us to test (some while ago) and there isn't a
final 3.0.8 on the ftp server, yet the latest zsh guide now talks about
the latest stable release being 3.0.8.
