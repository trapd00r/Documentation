I'm sorry, I was mistaken about having loaded new completion.  With the
new completion system *properly* loaded, I *can* get this to happen.

So here's the answer to your question:

    zstyle -e ':completion:*' file-patterns '[[ -d $PREFIX:h/. ]]'

This tests whether the prefix (or "/", if there's no prefix, but that's
harmless) contains a "." directory, then ignores the result; so the only
effect is to force the directory to be automounted.  Since it does not
set a value for $reply (see the "zstyle -e" doc), completion proceeds as
if the style were not set at all.

Note that if you actually *want* to set file-patterns for some other
context, you'll have to add the test to those styles as well, or the
side-effect will go away in those contexts.
