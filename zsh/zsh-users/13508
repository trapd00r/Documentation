Yes, you understand correctly.

I'm not sure why this is surprising; "ln=target" is a fairly recent
addition to ls / dircolors as well.  It's not supported on my CentOS4
machine at home, for example.  Zsh isn't a GNU project, so it will
always lag behind a little on significant changes to the GNU base.
