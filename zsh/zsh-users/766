   On the small number of occasions I actually i) log out, and ii) have
   jobs running, and hence get the warning, I just disown them.

You don't need to disown them when they are started with nohup, you
just have to hit ^D once more to logout. But that sometimes *is*
annoying. 

   If I was really keen, maybe I'd have done something in .zlogout to
   disown all my running jobs.

How would one do that elegantly? While zsh writes the output of "jobs"
to a file (which I wouldn't name the most elegant solution), it starts
a subshell which won't see the jobs of its parent if you either pipe
it into e.g. xargs or try to put it into a variable, e.g.
JOBS=(`jobs`)

Just curious.
