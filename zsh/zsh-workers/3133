Probably of some interest: I had problems with new patch 2.2. First, it
rejects plain -p option (without operand); second, if given patch
_without_ -p option at all, it cannot find any file with pathname.

patch -p0 seems to work. I don't remember, if -p0 was legal option in
earlier versions of patch, but if yes, please, add it to your shell
script. 

As a side note, our shell doesn't like 
     echo $errors hunk(s) failed.
line. It complaints "syntax error: `(' unexpected". It is claimed to be
POSIX-compliant.

greetings
