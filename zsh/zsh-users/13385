I think the original author was a vi user, so he must have thought about
this.  Presumably he found he usually wanted to change stuff at the end of
the like.

zsh is a completely different shell from ksh, so there is no "changed
default".  (The history, in fact, is that its features were based on a ksh
manual page, but there was no attempt to make it a ksh clone; some effort
has gone into adding compatibility options, but the line editor in zsh is
hugely different.)  There is a list in the FAQ of major differences,
however, and this is worth adding.

This sounds like a bug, but I haven't heard of it before.
