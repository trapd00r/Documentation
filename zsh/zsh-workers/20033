I don't think editing configure is really an option...

Does the following help?  Calling the code obscure would be an insult to
some perfectly charming obscure features of other languages, and I don't
have a suitable package to test, but in the in the listing for zsh's
configure it seemed to be doing the right thing for
--with-PACKAGE=[ARG].

In case the lines get rewrapped, the change is the addition of an extra ${(@)
near the start of the first altered line, and the addition of //\[=/=}
near the end of the second.
