Hi,

I'm trying to compile zsh on a fresh Tru64 5.1B install, but there's no
Makefile created. The configure script is finishes after "checking if
POSIX sigsuspend() works... yes", but there's a bunch of stuff after that
in config.log. This is zsh 4.2.1. I've compiled older versions of zsh on
older versions of Tru64, and haven't come across this problem before. Any
suggestions on how to fix this appreciated.

James Andrewartha
