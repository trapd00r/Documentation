I can't see anything significant happening in the next few days, so I'm
hoping to upload 4.2.1 by Friday.  (The only thing I'm expecting
to fix myself is a report from Eric S Raymond that one of the manual
pages doesn't convert to Docbook cleanly, if I remember.)

I will hold off the patch to warn about truncation of integers.  It's
been that way for so long it's not worth fixing in a hurry, and I'd like
the change to be tried out a bit better.

As you would expect, I'm going on holiday on Tuesday.
