It has nothing to do with terminal drivers.  The definition of TAB in
the ASCII character set is code point decimal 9, which corresponds to
ctrl-I in the same way that backspace (8) is ctrl-H and newline (10)
is ctrl-J.

} but is there a way to map these keys to different actions?

Now *this* does have to do with terminal drivers, because you may be
able to use the terminal driver to remap the character value(s) sent
when you press a given key combination.  But that point pressing the
keys "Ctrl" and "I" will no longer be sending a true ctrl-I character,
and other applications may get confused.

You'll have to look at the documentation for your terminal or terminal
emulator (xterm, kterm, gnome-terminal, PuTTY, whatever) to find out
how to do that remapping.
