Bash and zsh are real enough for me.  /bin/sh is /bin/sh no matter if
it's bash or zsh :-).  And if something does not work when /bin/sh is
a copy of zsh, than it is probably a zsh bug, and we'll fix it, right?
But how can I fix the old Bourne Shell for which I have no source?

ash is quite close.  You'd still need to remove some features from ash
to get a real old-fashionned shell.

But as long as it affects only make clean, it is not that bad as the
