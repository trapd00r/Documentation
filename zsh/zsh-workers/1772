} 
} That's wrong.  DIGBUFSIZE should be be used when a buffer has to store
} things like -2#101100001011101...  DIGBUFSIZE is for decimal digit buffers
} only.

Yes, decimal digits ARE what's being written into the buffers in the two
cases where I made the change.  Compare lines 651-656, which I changed,
to lines 708-711, which I did not change.  Why should DIGBUFSIZE be used
on 708 but not on 651?
