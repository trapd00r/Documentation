Subject: Export, arrays, and ksh emulation
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Zsh does not export arrays.  It marks them exported, but does not actually
put anything into the environment.

Ksh exports arrays by putting the first array element in the environment,
the same way that $array == ${array[0]} (as in zsh with ksh_arrays set).

Should zsh export the first element of an array, either when ksh_arrays is
set or just under ksh emulation, or in some other condition (new option)?
