I think also that closing stdin is right behavior to show that reading
from stdin is an error in completion. But it is bit more riskey than
redirecting stdin from /dev/null.

At least, on SunOS 4.1.4, following command produces strange result.
(some-file is opend as file descriptor 0 and comm confuses.)

  comm some-file - <&-

However, intentional read from stdin like above may not appear in
copmletion.
