No, it is all like above:

[hanno: /home/hanno]>zsh -f
[hanno: /home/hanno]>bindkey -v
[hanno: /home/hanno]>autoload -U compinit
[hanno: /home/hanno]>compinit -D
[hanno: /home/hanno]>cd /us
[hanno: /home/hanno]>env | egrep '^(TERM|VISUAL|EDITOR|PS1)' | cat -v
TERM=xterm-color
PS1=[%{^[[1;33m%}%n: ^[[1;35m%}%d%{^[[0m%}]>

see above.

I started the zsh with zsh -f, but the problems stay the same.
I found out, that the combination <ctrl + a> doesn't work, as I  
expected the cursor to jump to the beginning of the line.

Thats what happens:

[hanno: /home/hanno]>^A
