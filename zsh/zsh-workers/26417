Hi,

Is there some way to configure completion to never complete function
names starting with "_"?  The ignored-patterns style doesn't seem to
work..  this is especially a problem because I configure substring
completion as a fallback:

zstyle ':completion:*' matcher-list \
           '' 'm:{a-zA-Z}={A-Za-z}' 'l:|=* r:|=* m:{a-zA-Z}={A-Za-z}'

Alternately, some way to modify that matcher-list style to never add a
leading "_" in command positions would work.

It really seems some way to hide all the zle and completion functions
in a separate namespace/package/whatever would be the ideal solution.

thanks,
Greg
