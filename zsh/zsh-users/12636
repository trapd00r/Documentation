Thanks for the quick answer!

I need it mostly for global aliases, to reduce clutter, for example

alias -g  DN='>/dev/null 2>&1'
alias -g  NE='2>/dev/null'
alias -g  LF='>>$_LF 2>&1'

The separate file approach works, thanks, I just needed to added an
extra autoload wherever that base library was loaded.

Thanks,
Peter
