Subject: Parameter error trapped too late
Date: Mon, 16 Sep 2002 15:03:39 +0100
Message-ID: <1444.1032185019@csr.com>
From: Peter Stephenson <pws@csr.com>

% zsh -c 'fn() { local 30=foo; }; fn'
BUG: parameter recreated with wrong flags
fn:local: 30: can't assign initial value for array

Seems to have a dire effect on later use of parameters.
