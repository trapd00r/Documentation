} Did I really say that?

You did, but thank you anyway.  This is the least flaky I can ever recall
it being.  The only thing that still doesn't work is completion of a
reference into the current command, and even that now works a lot better
than it used to.

Here's zsh 2.4.300:

zipx1[22] echo foo bar !#:1 ba<TAB>
zsh: no such word in event
zipx1[22] echo foo bar
                       ^
		cursor here

Here's beta19 with your two patches:

zigzag% echo foo bar !#:1 ba<TAB>
[BEEP][cursor doesn't move]

Much better, but still not perfect.  I realize it probably can't expand
to the correct word, but could it at least ignore the history error and
continue completing stuff on the rest of the line?
