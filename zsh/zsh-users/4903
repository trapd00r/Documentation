Depends.  Have you set up query_command and are you using that?

Perhaps a better route, for someone who cares [1], might be to look at
wrapping zsh completion around the same query command.  Then, if mutt
has been correctly installed at a site, so that the site addressbook is
queries (whether LDAP, NIS or whatever) then zsh would have access to
the same information.

A search for "External Address Queries" in the mutt manual should turn
up the information and specification for the format of the returned
data.
