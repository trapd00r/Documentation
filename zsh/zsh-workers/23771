} This sort of question comes up often enough it would be a good
} idea to have some suitable code bundled with the shell.

The tricky bit about this one is that a change of directory in one
shell has to trigger a change of directory in all the other shells.
Aside from the problem of having those shells execute commands in the
idle space between prompts (or worse, while some external command is
still running), I can't figure out when (or why) it would be a good
idea to have this happen.

A variant of "cd" and/or "pushd" that says "put this shell in the same
directory stack as that one" (where maybe "that one" just means "the
latest shell to have executed a pushd/popd") would seem to me to make
more sense than something that automatically syncs ala SHARE_HISTORY.
