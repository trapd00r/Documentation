I haven't wrote this PROMPT I simply found it on google[1], it's an
exact copy of it though I have disabled APM/IBAM support beause
sometimes ACPI hangs on this computer and so all my shells hang.

Anyway I'll try it on Fedora and see how it goes, If I had the same
result then it's probably something in my environment, in that case
could you please try it with my whole environment?? Just add a new
user (test user) and do the following:

$ cd ~
$ svn co svn://wael.nasreddine.com/wael/trunk/co-base .

This should check out my basic configurations, everything related to
the shells/environment...

Then create all the symlinks..

$ ~/bin/svnfix

This would put all files where they should have been..

Now you could test with my environment and this way we can narrow it
down to System/Environment problems...
