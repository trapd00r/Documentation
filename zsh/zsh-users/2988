Now you know Shells, so you should first spend some time reading zsh
docs

TAB and following options should do the job
setopt automenu autolist should help too

It's even better than just seeing what is there just type TAB again and
one after the other possible extension is used.

man zshopt

and you should check the compctl or the like for cd it might look like:
compctl -g '*(-/)' cd rmdir

which means that you want after a cd just directories as expansion.

CTRL+R  (if you use emacs-bindings)

echo !!(number)

in you example
echo !!1 TAB expands to echo echo aaa

CTRL+k
or kill-line

guess zsh makes this automatically. But don't know
