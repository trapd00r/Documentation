ZSH allows the user to create interesting prompts. Time displaying, menu bars 
and colors.

Post your prompt (and .zshrc) here.

Mine is a rather simple one:
adi@omega ~ %                                                   1:27PM Fri

My zshrc::

alias d="ls --color"
alias ls="ls --color=auto"
alias ll="ls --color -lh"
alias nano="nano -w"
alias "nano --override"="nano"
alias BitchX="BitchX dushkinup"
      autoload -U compinit promptinit
      compinit
      promptinit; prompt gentoo

RPROMPT=' %B%@%b %U%D{%a}%u'
prompt="{%U%n#%l@%m:%h%u} %30<...<%~%#"

chpwd() {
   [[ -t 1 ]] || return
   if [[ -n $xterm_prompt ]] {
       print -Pn "\e]2;${USER}@${HOST}:%~\a"
   }
}

Men occasionally stumble over the truth, but most of them pick themselves
up and hurry off as if nothing had happened.
