Subject: Bump ZSH_VERSION (from 4.3.6-dev-0) or a zsh release?

I'm sort of ready to put out the first zsh debugger release. However
it would be real helpful if the current ZSH_VERSION number were
incremented. Even better though would be a general release.

What's the current release schedule look like?

Thanks.
