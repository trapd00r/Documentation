Put something in /etc/zshenv (or whatever path has been compiled for
that on your system) that stashes $0 in another parameter.  (This is
one of the few good uses of /etc/zshenv that I've ever considered; I
usually configure --disable-zshenv when building the shell myself.)

Or just do the $ZSH_NAME = $0:t test in /etc/zshenv and set a boolean
to indicate a script is running.
