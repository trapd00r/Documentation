I just made a new test release:

    41654 Nov 17 05:21 zsh-3.1.0-test3.diff.gz

md5sum:

487397c43fbf68cbeee7a42226c53e1e  zsh-3.1.0-test3.diff.gz

This is a patch against the clean zsh-3.0.1 sources.  I only tested it under
Linux and it may not even compile for you so it is really meant for
developers.  It can be found under

ftp://ftp.cs.elte.hu/pub/zsh/testing/zsh-3.1.0-test3.diff.gz

It may now support dynamic loading on SVR4 systems.  Try it.  If it does not
work, send a patch to fix it.

Zoltan
