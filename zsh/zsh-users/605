I don't entirely agree with this (restricting users to a handful of
commands on the machine), but does anyone on this list have experience
with this?

I thought of making a simple script that would act as the login shell
and limit commands to the desired subset; would it be possible to
retain command line editing and filename completion in such a
scenario.

Thanks for any advice.

Hi,

I have a couple machines on our LAN that I want users to only
be able to exec the simpilest of commands (ls,cp,cd,tar,...)
very similar to ftp, is there a simple way to do this?

Chesley

P.S. please reply back to ckm@cdc.noaa.gov THANKS ;-)
