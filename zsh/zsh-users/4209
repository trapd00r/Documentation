Subject: quick question about '%s' expansion

Hi,

I have a question regarding the expansion of '%s' for
commands. Issuing

	date +%s

results in the following output

	" date "+" date "+"999985277

using zsh 4.0.2 . However it works correctly (just printing the
amount of seconds) using an older zsh (3.x) . 
Is this a bug in 4.0.2?


Thanks,
Simon
