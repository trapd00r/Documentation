I've just checked and the problem doesn't occur on Linux. It does,
however, occur on at least Solaris 10 5/08 sparc using the latest zsh
from cvs, compiled with Sun Studio 12. Do you still have access to a
Solaris system?

I'll try to verify whether the problem occurs with a gcc build and on
OpenSolaris/x86, Solaris 8 etc.
