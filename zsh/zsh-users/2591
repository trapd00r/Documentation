Hello,

	Does anyone have a set of completions pre-written for the Rational
Clearcase UNIX command line tool (cleartool)? If not, does anyone have
similar completions for other versioning packages (RCS/CVS etc.) that I
could base completions for this product on? I'm new to zsh-completions and
greatly appreciate any help in this regard.
