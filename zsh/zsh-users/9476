Yes, I haven't yet looked at the code but I think wait is confused about
what it should be waiting for.  This code:

  print | (echo & wait)

also hangs (it's the simplest version I've found:  the pipeline and
the subshell are both necessary), but this code:

  (print | { echo &; wait } )

doesn't.

(Further discussion should really go onto zsh-workers which is where
the following remark is aimed.)

I have a horrible feeling this may be to do with the hairy list_pipe
code in exec.c.
