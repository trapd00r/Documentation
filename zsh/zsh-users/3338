Subject: how can one let completion work *inside* zsh scripts?

I don't know how to do completion _within_ scripts.
At the prompt it is not a big problem for me but within scripts I
have no clue. What messages of the archive should I read
regarding this question or can you show me how to do that?

Matthias
