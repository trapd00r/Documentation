Sorry, this is a bit offtopic.

I am looking for a method to set the title of
and xterm (and its icon) with the chpwd function.
This works just fine on my IRIX box, but at home
on my Linux box it won't work as described in the
intro.ms document. I've searched the docs for the
xterm control sequences (it looks like those mentionend
in intro.ms) but it just doesn't work.
Maybe the print -Pn doesn't get where it's assumed to.

One more question.
Does anybody know how to make the Backspace key
work like ^H on a Linux system console (it works
within an xterm).

Thanks for any hints,
