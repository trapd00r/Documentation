Yes.  Quote from man zshexpn:

COMMAND SUBSTITUTION
       A  command  enclosed  in  parentheses preceded by a dollar
       sign, like so: $(...) or quoted with grave accents:  `...`
       is  replaced  with  its standard output, with any trailing
       newlines deleted.

But really using $(echo "\n") is a quite expensive solution.  It requires a
fork().  You can just simply write

PROMPT='[%h] [OLD: $OLDPWD] [CURRENT: %~]
'

If you use csh_junkie_paren, turn it of, or put a backslash at the end of
the line.
