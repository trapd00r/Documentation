Is it?  It handles (v|w)), but it doesn't handle this case:

	case v in
	(v|w)|x)   gigo="case '(v|w)|x)'"
		echo $gigo;;
	*)      gigo="case '*)'"
		echo $gigo;;
	esac

I backed out my patch and applied yours, and I still get:

	zsh: command not found: gigo=case '(v|w)|x)'

Yes, I know, but there are other cases in parse.c that lookahead with
hgetc().

That's fine, but doesn't address the problem.
