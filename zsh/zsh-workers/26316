If the reason for this behavior is incredibly pointless, should there
be a shell option to change the default to the more reasonable thing?

I still do not understand why I get exactly two empty strings no
matter how many colons I have in the input string: I would expect
none based on the description you cited.

phl% x=::::: && for v in "${(s-:-)x}" ; do echo "v= =>$v<=" ; done
v= =><=
v= =><=
phl% x=: && for v in "${(s-:-)x}" ; do echo "v= =>$v<=" ; done 
v= =><=
v= =><=

thanks,
Greg
