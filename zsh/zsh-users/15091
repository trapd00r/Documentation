If that's the case, I might expect a hostname like 
pool-68-162-167-80.pitt.east.verizon.net (something from a DHCP pool 
assigned by an ISP).  Not something on akamaiedge.net, which is 
certainly not an ISP.  Unless someone's playing weird games with routing 
via Amazon-EC2.  (More likely, that one in particular seems like some 
upstream DNS misconfiguration, akin to the bad PTR record for an RFC 
1918 address in this post[1].)

Regardless, OS X is far from the only O/S that'll update hostnames when 
you join a network.  And especially on a laptop, it often makes sense.  
For instance, after associating with a university's wireless network, 
your host probably has a different name assigned to it.  Why would it be 
bad to update it?

What part, and how so?
