I've fixed this, I think, though the other items are still open.
I've committed the result with a few minor tweaks.  Note that
you can use a numeric argument to control this by using zstyle -e.

Remember, too, that you need to recompile the main shell to get this
to work (though unless you set the file-list style it shouldn't try
to use the new compadd option).

Feedback is useful.

(I've finally changed the version in the archvie to 4.3.2-dev-1 as I said
was going to do last week.)
