Well, I did upgrade, and it fixed the problem (thanks!), but it caused me a
little bit of bother on the way. The ./configure script didn't find the
function yp_all properly. It turns out that this is because it doesn't
actually _look_ for yp_all - it looks for getdomainname and assumes yp_all
is available once getdomainname is found. Unfortunately (for whatever
reason) on my system getdomainname is found easily but yp_all has to be got
from libnsl. I fixed the problem by hacking configure.in to insert an
explicit search for yp_all (by simply changing instances of getdomainname
to yp_all) et voila. Is this just my server's fault (which I could easily
believe!) or does RH Linux do this to other people?
