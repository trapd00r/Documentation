} I've just tried to compile zsh-3.0.5-test2 on an ancient SunOS 4.1.2 with
} K&R compiler, and rlimits.awk failed, since it does not seem to support
} || in the pattern part.  Could you please everyone check with his own awk
} (the older the better) if the fix below works?

The modified rlimits.awk appears to work OK on RedHat 4.2 / Linux 2.0.28 /
gawk 3.0.3 (though I must say that three consecutive `s' in "addressspace"
looks a bit strange; I'd never noticed that one before).

} If noone complains, that will be released as zsh-3.0.5 tomorrow.

Are you going to include PWS's $(r) patch from article 3526?
