} We need intermediate solution for a completion function of such
} commands: more powerful than _arguments and easier than shell
} function.  But more difficult than _arguments, maybe.
} 
} My idea is already implemented: _regex_arguments.

Indeed, I think _regex_arguments is just the thing here.  In fact, I said
so, back in 11018.

} Personally I find _arguments a whole lot more readable than
} _regex_arguments. If that could be improved, I'd be glad.

Is there any chance that it could now be rewritten using extendedglob
patterns, rather than parsing its own RE syntax?

On the other hand, that might not make it any more readable.
