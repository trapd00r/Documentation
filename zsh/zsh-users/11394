Subject: Problems with vi-goto-mark and vi-set-mark
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1; format=flowed
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Content-Disposition: inline

I've recently been trying to use viins/vicmd mode.  I've hit a small
problem with the vi-set-mark and vi-goto-mark, they seem to be broken
in the latest version of zsh.  Though it looks like it was working in
4.2.5.

To reproduce:
zsh -f
% bindkey -v
% echo <ESC>maiabcdef
   # ESC changes to vicmd mode
   # ma    creates mark 'a' at the position
   # i   go back to viins mode
   # abcdef    actually doing self-inserts
% echo <ESC>`a
    # <ESC> changes to vicmd mode
    # `a   is suppose to go to mark 'a' from the previous line, but in
the latest version it doesn't seem to work.  It look like it has been
broken for more than a year in 4.3.0

-FR.
