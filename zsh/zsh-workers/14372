} No, it wasn't me.  Unfortunately the CVS change is when I updated Akira's
} CVS archive with a whole pile of changes, so all I know is that it happened
} between 15th April 1999 and 6th April 2000.

I have this notation in my personal CVS repository for a revision that
covers the entire body of subst_parse_str():

Sven: 9763: Fix quoting behavior of ${(e)...} substitutions.

Looks like before that patch it used parse_subst_str() instead.  So it
may be that what we need is to call parsestr() when the outer expansion is
quoted, and parse_subst_str() when it is not?
