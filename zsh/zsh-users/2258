I'd just like to point out, that setting title to the command
name/parameters is probably not trivial. preexec gets the whole command line
(at least,as long as I can beleive the manual. Are parameter assignments
included?). It means, that in case of some more or less complex things
(braces, pipelines etc) you have to parse the string again ... and, well,
you can even have redirection as the first word on command line :-)
