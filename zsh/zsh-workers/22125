Subject: Bug in { completion's comma removal

I haven't tried to trace this down yet, but I noticed a bug in recent
multibyte-enabled zsh versions (including CVS):

  % touch foo faa
  % ls f{oo,a<TAB>       # pressing TAB results in:
  % ls f{oo,aa,_         # (note: _ is the cursor) OK so far...
  % ls f{oo,aa,}_        # typing } does not remove the comma

This bug does not appear in the latest code if I build it without
MULTIBYTE_SUPPORT enabled.
