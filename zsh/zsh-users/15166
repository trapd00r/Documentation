on freebsd, zsh installs as /usr/local/bin/zsh. on linux (and most other 
systems?) it installs as /usr/bin/zsh.

what's the best way to make zsh script portable between linux and freebsd?

i could start the script with:
 	#!/usr/bin/env zsh

or i could specify that the script be executed as:
 	zsh script

is there a better way?
