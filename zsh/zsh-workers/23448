Hi Zsh Comrades,

Yesterday i found what it seems to be a very old bug.

bindkey <whatever> history-beginning-search-backwards &&
echo $widgets crashes zsh, it does with zsh -f.
On #zsh Frank Terbeck had it crash even with 3.1.7. All
versions that have history-beginning-search-backwards did
crash, it seems.

gdb zsh core has:

        Program terminated with signal 11, Segmentation
        fault.
        #0  widgetstr (w=0x0) at
        ../../../Src/Zle/zleparameter.c:78
        78      ../../../Src/Zle/zleparameter.c: No such
        file or directory.
                in ../../../Src/Zle/zleparameter.c


                Greetings,
                        Matthias
