I would be up for something that at least strips out the large mime
stuff.  I can still filter spam client side, but getting the several
daily large attachments is getting annoying. (yes, I still use dial-up)

If you wanted to do some limiting -- I think that non-members having to
be 'approved' is the most severe that should be implemented.
