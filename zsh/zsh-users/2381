I've never used Win32 zsh so can't help you with the other questions.

There isn't any plans I've heard of to write a Win 95 GUI for zsh. The
problem is the program Microsoft supply for running DOS programs in a window
because it's crap. 
What would be more useful than adding a GUI to win32 zsh (like that of vim)
would
be a separate program which can run any DOS application in a window and
offers scrolling etc. There is a shareware program which can do this: Take
Command. It is based on 4DOS which was a popular command.com replacement
before the Windows era. Anyway, Take Command should be able to run the Win32
version of zsh and give you a scollable buffer. I've never tried it myself
though. You can get it from JP Software - www.jpsoft.com.
