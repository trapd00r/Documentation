Hi,

I often do something like

  svn log file | m

(where m is an alias for less). But when I use insert-last-word, I get
the "m" instead of "file". Is there a way to ignore the one-character
words?

Alternatively, is there a way to make

  svn log file |

behave a bit like "< file", i.e. using READNULLCMD instead of getting
another prompt (and use "... | \" to get the prompt)?
