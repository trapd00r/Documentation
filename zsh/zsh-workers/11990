Subject: build problem with new texi2html

I compiled a snapshot of today's CVS tree in order to test _dpkg and zmv;
unfortunately, I've upgraded to texi2html 1.62.1 from 1.56k, and it broke.

Seems that     -expandinfo    : use @ifinfo sections, not @iftex
has changed to   -expand [info,tex]     : expand info/tex sections

So I just added a space to Doc/Makefile.in and it didn't choke, but it
did spew this:

texi2html -expand info -split_chapter ./zsh.texi
