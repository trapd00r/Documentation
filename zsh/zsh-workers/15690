Yeah, the GPL is fairly clear on that. There is nothing which states
that the licence has to be in a file named `COPYING' though so it might
be better to call it ansi2knr-licence or something like that otherwise
people might mistakenly think zsh is GPLd. Or we could stick the whole
GPL in a comment in ansi2knr.c.

Doesn't make sense really does it. Digging out an old copy of zsh, Paul
Falstad's name used to appear between `if' and `and'. Whoever removed it
must have messed up so I think we can just remove the word `and'.

Where does the zsh licence originate from out of interest?
