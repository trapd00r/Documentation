You can try telling completion to accept any directory that it knows exists
without trying to expand the path:

zstyle ':completion:*' accept-exact-dirs true

I'm not sure if this will help in the case you're describing, however,
since it looks like it might not be able to tell if the directory exists.
You'll need zsh 4.3.
