===============

check out how i build a path in my zshrc - http://smasher.org/zsh/

that seems robust and portable.

hhmmmm... looking over it, i should probably change that from a pile of 
"if" to a "case"...

 	"Juridically they are both equal [the worker and capitalist];
 	 but economically the worker is the serf of the capitalist...
 	 thereby the worker sells his person and his liberty for a
 	 given time. The worker is in the position of a serf because
 	 this terrible threat of starvation which daily hangs over
 	 his head and over his family, will force him to accept any
 	 conditions imposed by the gainful calculations of the
 	 capitalist, the industrialist, the employer... The worker
 	 always has the right to leave his employer, but has he the
 	 means to do so? No, he does it in order to sell himself to
 	 another employer. He is driven to it by the same hunger
 	 which forces him to sell himself to the first employer. Thus
 	 the worker's liberty... is only a theoretical freedom,
 	 lacking any means for its possible realization, and
 	 consequently it is only a fictitious liberty, an utter
 	 falsehood. The truth is that the whole life of the worker
 	 is simply a continuous and dismaying succession of terms of
 	 serfdom -- voluntary from the juridical point of view but
 	 compulsory from an economic sense -- broken up by momentarily
 	 brief interludes of freedom accompanied by starvation; in
 	 other words, it is real slavery."
