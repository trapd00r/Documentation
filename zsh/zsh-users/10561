This is not a bad plan, but it plays havoc with #autoload and #compdef,
which are going to install the function or widget under its base file
name, which obviously can't have a slash in it.  Yes, you can sort of
work around it with #compdef -K, but that's ugly.  Choosing a character
other than slash (perhaps dot?  Or does that break on Cygwin?) would
be sufficient.
