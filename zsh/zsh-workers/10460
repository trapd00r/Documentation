Subject: Files missing from zsh-3.1.6-dev-21 ?
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Following a "cvs ... co -r zsh-3_1_6-dev-21 -d zsh-forge zsh" I unpacked
zsh-3.1.6-dev-21.tar.gz and ran a diff:

Only in ../../zsh-forge/Completion/Builtins: _emulate
Only in ../../zsh-forge/Completion/Builtins: _zcompile
Only in ../../zsh-forge/Completion/Core: _all_labels
Only in ../../zsh-forge/Completion/Core: _ignored
Only in ../../zsh-forge/Completion/Core: _next_label

Those would appear to be files that have the zsh-3_1_6-dev-21 tag but are
not included in the .tar.gz file.  The diff is otherwise clean.

I've committed new .distfiles to sourceforge, but the .tar.gz probably
should be rebuilt.
