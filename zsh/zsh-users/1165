3.0.0 is in fact what I had, so that sounds like the problem.  I've now
compiled 3.1.2 which is working beautifully and I'm very happy.  Thanks, 
y'all!

(Literally, that was the only thing I've found in zsh which I didn't like.
That, for any piece of software more complex than "Hello World", is very
unusual...)

Indeed there is.  However I was uncertain as to which was correct since the
man page for ypall on OSF is also incorrect, it gives the prototype without
the *.  And to think I used to like DEC <sigh>...

(Now what would make me really deliriously happy would be to find a port
of zsh for MSDOS (not Windows or OS/2, straight DOS)...)
