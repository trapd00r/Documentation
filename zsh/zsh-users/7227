    I'm very used to have Shift-PgUp/PgDn mapped to the scrollback
facility, in fact I consider it a 'system mapping' (which is not, you
can remap that keycombo...). Bart suggested you a very good idea:
C-v. This combination is mapped to 'quoted-insert' by default. This
function inserts the next pressed character or key combo literally.
It is very useful to discover which sequence is emitted by a certain
key combination.

    In the case of C-PgUp, I prefer shift-PgUp for the scrollback
facility, but many systems have Ctrl mapped, instead.
