OK, you're interpreting "width" differently... to me, that's a string
length, not a width at all.  It doesn't really matter as long as it's
documented.

So that would be the last option I posted, treat multibyte characters
but assume they have width 1 (or, in better English, use string lengths
rather than character widths for padding) unless there's an additional
flag.  I would propose to supply such a flag, if we go this way.

I don't really see why a normal user would assume the expression
*didn't* deal with printable widths, but, again, that's mostly a matter
of documentation.
