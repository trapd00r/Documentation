} Ah, that's a different kettle of fish entirely.  I don't see any problem
} including the patch.  I doubt if anyone is attached to the current
} ambiguous behaviour of xtrace, are they?

I don't have any particular problem with the patch -- though I'm not sure
it covers all possible places where trace output is produced; I haven't
checked -- but I would point out that there are a whole lot of things
beyond mere argument quoting that prevent zsh's xtrace output from being
cut'n'paste-able.  Individual commands and their arguments might be, but  
for almost any more complex syntactic structure you're out of luck.
