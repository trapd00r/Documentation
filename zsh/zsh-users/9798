I've tried it but it failed so thought that i misunderstood the man ... 
thanks for you, i understood that it was a $pattern specific error.

in fact, my pattern was : 
/home/mc/src/2z/expo/*(jpeg|jpg|png|JPEG|JPG|PNG)(N)
so the complete one :

/home/mc/src/2z/expo/*(jpeg|jpg|png|JPEG|JPG|PNG)(N)(:t)

must be :

/home/mc/src/2z/expo/*(jpeg|jpg|png|JPEG|JPG|PNG)(N:t)

thanks!

regards
mc
