In zsh, another command for listing the history is fc -l.  (Fc is a command
that lets you do several things with the history.)  If you add on the flags
-d, -f, -E, or -D, then you get time info.  From the man page:

          Also
          when listing, -d prints timestamps  for  each  command,
          and -f prints full time-date stamps. Adding the -E flag
          causes the dates to be printed as  `dd.mm.yyyy'.   With
          the -D flag, fc prints elapsed times.

Hope this helps.
