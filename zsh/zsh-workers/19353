    Hi Bart :)

    It *must* be, because if I delete /etc/zshenv and run the tests,
they no longer hang. Instead, all of the 'Y' tests fail. I'll try to
isolate the problem within my /etc/zshenv.

    Other possibility is that the 'Y' test are using some standard
Unix command that I don't have and that is the cause of the hang
and/or of the failure :?

    Simply renaming /etc/zshenv won't do? I'll try to isolate the
problem if tomorrow I can afford the time. I'll tell here if I
discover anything.

    Thanks for your help :)
