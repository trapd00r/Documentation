Yes that is it -- /usr/lib/libtinfo* links to libncurses*.   I see in 
other threads that #defining ERR has been proposed for other reasons.  I 
guess that will fix it, but still leave the  implicit declaration 
warnings.   Seems it would be better to fix configure, assuming this 
libtinfo link thing is something reasonably "standard".
