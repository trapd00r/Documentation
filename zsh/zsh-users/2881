My (fairly dumb) solution:

for i in *.phtml; do mv $i $(basename $i .phtml).php; done

It does have the advantage of being fairly easy to remember and it'll work
on any shell.  (Well, if you change $(...) to `...`, anyway.)

I'm sure somebody here can come up with an answer that'll win some
obsfucated "How to rename all files with one extension to another" zsh
content :).
