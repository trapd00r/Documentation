    Hi Vincent :)

    Not that I know of. Maybe your rc files are doing something
weird?
 
> For example:
> 
> # export x=1 y=2 z=3 q=4 r=5
> # env
> ...
> SAVEHIST=500
> DIRSTACKSIZE=8
> x=1
> y=2
> z=3
> q=4
> r=5
> 
> # zsh
> # env
> ...
> SAVEHIST=500
> DIRSTACKSIZE=8
> x=1
> z=3
> q=4

    Same commands here and I didn't got that output. My 'env' showed
the same list of vars the two times, running 4.2.5. Maybe you hit a
bug in an older version :?????
