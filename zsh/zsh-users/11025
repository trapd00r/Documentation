It should work if you are using the new completion system
and the GLOB_COMPLETE option is set.  If it's not set,
you should still be able to complete =lpr- without the *
(* is not a standard completion syntax, it's usually used
for expansion on the command line).

That's not how it works.  The filename expansion "=" is performed
first, searching for the path to a file name (not a pattern).
When that's finished filename generation handles the *.
That's why they're in different sections in the manual in that
order.
