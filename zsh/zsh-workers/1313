POSIX 1003.2 says that if test has three arguments and $2 is a binary
operator then perform the binary test of $1 and $3.  If $1 is `!', negate
the two-argument test of $2 and $3.  Otherwise, produce unspecified
results.

Zsh will be modified according to this (which is more logical than the
present behaviour).
