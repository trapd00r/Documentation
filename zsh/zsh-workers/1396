That's probably better.  Since I have a clock on my screen anyway,
having the time in every xterm is probably unnecessary.  Probably
using periodic and PERIOD would be better!  I used to use chpwd, but
there was some problem with that, probably the way it messed up things
like "(cd /foo; tar cf - bbb) | tar xf -".
