I see what you mean.  You need to have one single set of shell setup
files, that will be used by any user that makes no attempt to change eir
setup.  However, I disagree that these need to be called /etc/zshenv etc..
It would be much better to have an /etc/skel setup with files that just
source your master files, which you can keep anywhere you want (say,
/usr/local/lib/skel).
