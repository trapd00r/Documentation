================

it's not my desire to emulate ksh's discipline functions or compound 
variables, i just want a way to define a "simple" variable as a function.

basically i want to do thing like roll my own $RANDOM and $EPOCHSECONDS. 
i'm not seeing how that has anything to do with parsing compound 
variables...?
