Subject: loading a set of functions

Hi,

I am also a newcomer to zsh. I see plenty of functions in the
<installation path>/share/zsh/3.1.9/functions

- Is it possible to load eg. all of them?

- Or else, if I have my own functions in a separate directory, is it
possible to autoload all without specifying their names separately?

- What is the difference between functions starting with "_" and the
others?

- Are there any further libraries of functions not in the distribution?

Cheers,
Gaspar
