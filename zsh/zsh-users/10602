Hmm... I haven't looked at the source but in my case it seems to
be being hashed straight away...

zsh -f -c 'zmodload -i zsh/parameter
print $commands[script]
unhash script
print $commands[script]'

prints /usr/bin/script the first time and nothing the second time.
/etc/zshenv is empty.  Aha---it looks like zsh/parameter is filling the
hash table itself (based on the HASHLISTALL option which is on by default).
So maybe putting

zmodload -i zsh/parameter

early in your initialization file (it'll probably be loaded by the completion
system later anyway) is good enough.
