The zftp core code will switch to binary if the remote server claims to be
UNIX with 8-bit characters.  (Actually it won't do this until you are
logged in, because some servers won't let you, but this shouldn't be a
problem.)

Look and see if $ZFTP_SYSTEM contains "UNIX Type: L8"; if not, it won't
happen automatically.

It should be easy to adapt the function suite to remember this.  It would
be even easier to make binary the default:  just doctor zfopen and zfanon
and put `zftype binary' at the end.  Hooks aren't currently implemented,
but that could be done.

Making zfget support [user@]host:file and URL notation for one-off
retrievals is another useful, and relatively simple, possibility.  I
haven't been doing much with zftp recently.

My own bugbear is that interrupt handling is very bad.  I was hoping
someone else would get fed up with this and fix it.
