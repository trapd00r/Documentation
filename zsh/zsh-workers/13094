} Hm. Should we change that?

Possibly so.

} I don't know why I added that test anymore. Maybe I somehow had the
} impression that hash does the same? Hm.

It's probably because such a test is used to decide whether a reference
to a parameter with ~paramname will cause an entry to be made in the
nameddir table.  But assignment to the nameddirs special hash is more
like using the "hash" command than it is like using ~paramname.
