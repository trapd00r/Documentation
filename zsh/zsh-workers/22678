sched doesn't know if you're doing output to the terminal at all.

Or on.  That was my first thought, but I wondered if it could be made
more intelligent.

That looks like a problem.  Maybe it needs to be an option to sched, in
that case; that's the simplest thing to do and I'll change it.  Of
course you can use a function with zle -I in it, but that makes using
sched for simple output a little too difficult.

Currently it is (and this is documented under "print -t", but not for
"echo" itself), but it doesn't need to be.  This will go away if I move
the behaviour to sched.

I haven't change any key timeout at all, I've changed the *limit*.  It's
now long enough for any conceivable use of a key timeout.  The 5 second
limit was arbitrary but arguably not long enough for any *conceivable*
use.  The change doesn't show up unless you set KEYTIMEOUT to something
more than 500.  This saves me from having two different limits built
into the code since I need one for restarting the timeout for sched
events long in the future (which are probably atypical but there's no
good reason why they shouldn't work).

I didn't see a good use for this, but it's not a very difficult change.
