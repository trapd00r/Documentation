[line stripped to patternt to fit without wrapping.

The current code (4.3) uses an egrep pattern, 

'#[ 	]*define[ 	][ 	]*E[0-9A-Z]*[ 	]*(_HURD_ERRNO \()?[0-9]+\)?'

so it looks like yours isn't good enough any more.  Also, since there's
no $ anchor (difficult in general since there may be comments at the end
of the line) the last [_A-Z0-9]* doesn't have any effect on the match,
and it's not clear turning the * into a + would make much difference.

The following covers both cases, but may be too general:

'#[ 	]*define[ 	][ 	]*E[0-9A-Z]*[ 	]*(_HURD_ERRNO )?\(?[_A-Z0-9]'

Any further tweaks (from any system)?
