It seems that zsh process substitution doesn't work properly on recent 
versions of FreeBSD.  Here's what happens:

% cat <(date)
cat: /dev/fd/11: No such file or directory

This happens to me on FreeBSD 5.4 with zsh 4.2.5 built with default 
configure options.

I'm not on the list, so please Cc responses to me.
