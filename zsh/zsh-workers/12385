(that should be `too' again.  Ime geting to fenetik.)

That was an old cygwin1.dll I put in winnt/system32 to make it easier to
find --- there's a problem that if you start /usr/local/bin/zsh and
cygwin1.dll isn't in the path, it isn't found.  The easiest thing here was
to copy it to /usr/local/bin, where at least I'm likely to notice the
problem.

config.log doesn't report an error for the tgetent test programme, but the
test is correctly set to `no', so it looks like the same problem may be
here, too.  The shell recompiles from scratch and runs OK.
