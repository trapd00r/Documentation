I have noticed a problem with zsh2.6-beta9, zsh2.6-beta10 which did not
happen in any release I have tried before that.

When I 'su -' to a user who has zsh as their default shell, the stty
settings appear to be garbled.  Doing a 'stty -a' reports that they
are ok, but ctrl-c no longer does a intr and ^H no longer does erase.

resetting the stty setting for erase cures the erase problem, but resetting
intr does not work as expected.

Oh, I am running zsh on Solaris 2.4 -- it all compiled without any problems
and installed marvellously easily.  I have tried recompiling with
gcc-2.7.0 to no avail.

Thanks for the great shell!

Jon
