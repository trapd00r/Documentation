I was decrementing my term width and couldn't reproduce it.  I'll try
with some other directories.

:This one I can reproduce as follows:

Can't reproduce it with that and the four permutations of vanilla zsh-4.2.0,
zsh-4.2.0-dev-1 (from today), & rxvt and xterm 4.3.99.903(184).  Sits on ``f''

g% egrefoo
Completing `external command', `builtin command', `shell function', `alias', `su
ffix alias', `reserved word', `job', `parameter', or `corrections'

Putting term width at 73 gives two full lines, still works.  Widths of 72, 74,
145, 146 & 147 (and 80) also work.  I wonder what else is involved.

Geoff
