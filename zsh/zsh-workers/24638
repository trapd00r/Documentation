Something that's been bothering me for years now with zsh is that the
built-in completion can't complete

PATH=/usr/bin:/sb<TAB>

presumably because it doesn't consider the colon a word boundary. Could
someone please point me at the code responsible so that I can fix this.

p.s.: I know that the function-based completion system doesn't have this
problem, but I don't want to use it.
