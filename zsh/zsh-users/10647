The esc-[-Z sequence for shift+tab does seem to be standard in more
recent versions of X11 (possibly Xorg but not XFree86?), though I'm
not having any luck tracking down where it gets set.  E.g., it works
in my xterm on RedHat EL4, but not RedHat EL3, and it's not getting
assigned in the app-defaults.
