You mean PWS's user guide that's on-line at zsh.org?  I'm pretty sure 
that's its original date of "publication" and doesn't reflect incremental
updates.

I _think_ that'd require changes to the C code as well.  Menu selection is 
a bit unusual in that it runs zle with a new keymap but then interprets 
several of the built-in widgets differently.  I'm pretty sure you can't
change the listing from widgets in that keymap, but there might be some
convoluted way to cause menu selection to exit and then immediately start
again on a new set of matches.
