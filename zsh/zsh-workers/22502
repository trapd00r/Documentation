Hello

What is the stable version of zsh, e.g. what should distributions ship,
4.2 or 4.3?

Greetings,
Frank

Did you ever realize how much text fits in eighty columns? If you now consider
that a signature usually consists of up to four lines, this gives you enough
space to spread a tremendous amount of information with your messages. So seize
this opportunity and don't waste your signature with bullshit nobody will read.
