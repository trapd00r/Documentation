I just reconfigured on IRIX 6.2 and the configuration all seems to be
fine here, out of the box (this is with cc as compiler), so I have no
clues as to why typtab, RLIM_T_IS_QUAD_T, RLIM_T_IS_UNSIGNED,
GETPGRP_VOID or DYNAMIC should require speical treatment sometimes.
I should qualify that:  I haven't compiled it yet, but no previous
pws-* version required any modification to typtab on that system.
