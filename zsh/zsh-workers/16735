Well, it doesn't matter which we add for the time being, but we should
stick in one or other for people to try out.  Probably it can safely go
in 4.0 as well.

The answer to the question Bart asked the first time round `how do I
find out if I'm at PS2' is, unless I'm missing a subtlety, `[[ -n
$PREBUFFER ]]'.  It's not clear to me what you do in that case anyway.
