They're supposed to be.

> TRAPDEBUG prompt_bart_precmd precmd
> prompt_bart_precmd:1 Src/zsh:2 Src/zsh:9

So Src/zsh:9 calls precmd, Src/zsh:2 (precmd?) calls prompt_bart_precmd,
and prompt_bart_precmd:1 unwittingly calls TRAPDEBUG.

Maybe grabbing the name of the previous function from the funcstack
would be more useful.
