I suggest breakpointing where REDIR_CLOSE is handled around line 2708 of
exec.c in such an environment (which I don't have) to see what's happening.
I suppose it's just vaguely possible that stdin has been set up as a
multio for some reason:  addfd() is the function that adds to a multio
and closemn() is where they are actually spawned (it's quite badly named).

I'm likely to be offline for most of the next couple of weeks.
