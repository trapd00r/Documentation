<H1 CLASS="chapterhead">LN01 Page Printer</H1>
<H2>Overview</H2>
<P>The LN01 Laser Printer is a nonimpact page printer ideal for applications where
print quality is important. Using electrophotographic technology, the LN01 prints
one page at a time, up to a maximum of 12 pages per minute. The printing resolution
of 300 by 300 dots per inch produces perfectly formed characters of even density
and alignment.</P>
<P>The LN01 Laser Printer is the first in Digital's family of nonimpact printers. The
demand for nonimpact printing is growing for several reasons. Nonimpact printing
is quiet &#8211; there are no noisy paper feed mechanisms or striking hammers. Since
nonimpact printers use regular cutsheet paper and standard paper shapes and
sizes, it saves money. Because image resolution is high, the LN01 prints a sharp,
clear character.</P>
<P>The following laser printers are available.</P>
<DL>
<DT><EM>LN01-CA</EM></DT>
<DD>A freestanding electronic printer, incorporating all options; font
and page storage; LP11 controller; 9.1-meter (30-foot) BC27A cable and 70-18953-01

</UL>
<H2>Printing Features</H2>
<P>The LN01's laser printing process is relatively simple. The LN01 has a conductive
drum that is uniformly charged. The charge is removed by the laser from all areas
that are not needed for the page's image. This leaves a latent charge image on the
drum. This latent image attracts a dry ink substance that is subsequently transferred
to the paper. A thermal process fixes the image, making it permanent.</P>
<H3>Print Resolution</H3>
<P>The LN01 has a printing resolution of 300 dots per inch both horizontally and vertically.
Minimum print area and positional resolution are important factors to consider.</P>
<P>The minimum print area requirements are:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Black dot &#8211; minimum of two-pixel-by-two-pixel array</LI>
<LI>White dot &#8211; minimum of two-pixel-by-one-pixel array</LI>
<LI>Black line &#8211; minimum width of two pixels</LI>
<LI>White line &#8211; minimum width of one pixel</LI>
</UL>
<P>With positional resolution, characters (bit maps invoked with a single code) will be
placed on even pixel positions in the scan direction (long edge of the paper). The
positional resolution for characters is therefore 150 dots per inch in the scan direction
and 300 dots per inch the other. Dots within a character are always 300 dots
per inch. The LN01 rounds odd-numbered positions to the next lower even number.</P>

<H2>Paper</H2>
<P>Whether your application requires vertical (portrait) or horizontal (landscape) printing,
color paper, or a range of paper stocks between 16 and 24 pounds, the LN01
laser printer can do it. It can even print up to 132 columns of standard lineprinter
output in landscape mode on 21.6-by-27.9-centimeter (8.5-by-11-inch) paper.</P>
<P>Cutsheet paper is fed into the machine from two cassettes, each holding up to
250 sheets. You can select from three sizes of trays: standard, 21.6-by-27.9-centimeters
(8.5-by-11-inches); legal, 21.6-by-35.6-centimeters (8.5-by-14-inches); or
European, 21-by-29.7-centimeters (8.3-by-11.7-inches).</P>
<P>The output stacker holds approximately 500 sheets of paper and accommodates
paper ranging from 16 to 24 pounds. When the output stacker is full, printing stops
and a C4 status code appears. Printing restarts automatically when you empty the
output stacker.</P>
<P>Best results are achieved by using 20-pound ordinary cutsheet paper. Digital
LN01X-AB, 21.6-by-27.9-centimeter (8.5-by-11-inch) paper and Digital LN01X-AD,
21-by-29.7-centimeter (8.3-by-11.7-inch) paper or their equivalents yield
optimal results. Digital does not recommend the use of gummed labels or transparency
stock.</P>

<P><STRONG>Offline Indicator</STRONG><BR>
When illuminated, this means the printer is off-line.</P>
<P><STRONG>Power Supply Indicator</STRONG><BR>
When illuminated, this means the power supply is functioning properly. The front
door must be opened to see this indicator.</P>
<P><STRONG>Page Counter</STRONG><BR>
A digital meter, which counts each sheet of paper that enters the paper path, is
installed inside the front cover.</P>
<P><STRONG>Power On/Off</STRONG><BR>
A two-position switch located behind the front cover allows the operator to engage
and disengage machine power.</P>
<H2>Operation</H2>
<P>The LN01 laser printer consists of two basic elements &#8211; an LN01 marking engine
(also referred to as the Image Output Terminal &#8211; IOT) and an LN01 laser printer
controller (also known as the Electronic Subsystem or ESS), integrated into a single
unit.</P>
<P>The printer mechanism removes individual sheets of paper from a tray, transports
the sheets via its paper path to the printing engine, then deposits the printed
sheet into the receiving bin. Printing is accomplished by using a laser electrophotography
process within the IOT. The IOT uses a drum whose surface has an electrosensitive
material being capacitivity charged by the process of ionization. The
charge is removed by the impingement of the modulated laser light. The removal of
the charge results in a latent image impressed on the drum surface. The inking or
toning medium is attracted to these areas of retained charge, adhere to the drum,
and thus produce the pattern or image that is subsequently transferred to a sheet of
paper.</P>
<P>The paper path then carries the printed sheet through a thermal operation that
makes the deposited image permanent.</P>
<H2>Special Nonprinting ASCII Control Codes</H2>
<P>The LN01 uses the following special, nonprinting ASCII control codes. More
detailed information can be found in the <CITE>LN01 Programmers Reference Manual</CITE>.</P>
<H3>Horizontal Tab (011<SUB>8</SUB>)</H3>
<P>The horizontal tab character advances the active position to the next horizontal
stop that is greater than the current active position but no greater than the right
margin.</P>
<H3>Linefeed (012<SUB>8</SUB>)</H3>
<P>The linefeed character increments the active line, and causes the active column to
be moved to the left margin. When the active line is incremented past the bottom
margin, it sets the active line to the top margin of the next page.</P>
<H3>Vertical Tab (013<SUB>8</SUB>)</H3>
<P>The vertical tab character advances the active line to the next vertical tab stop that
is greater than the current active line. If the bottom margin is exceeded, the active
line is set to the top line of the next page. The active column is not changed.</P>
<H3>Form Feed (014<SUB>8</SUB>)</H3>
<P>The form feed character advances the active line to the top margin of the next page
and sets the active position to the first character position of the first line. This
causes the current page buffer to be printed.</P>
<H3>Carriage Return (015<SUB>8</SUB>)</H3>
<P>The carriage return character causes the active column to be moved to the left margin.</P>
<H3>Space (040<SUB>8</SUB>)</H3>
<P>The space character can be considered either a control character or a printable
character. Its width is determined by the font set selected.</P>
<H3>Cancel (030<SUB>8</SUB>)</H3>
<P>The cancel character indicates that the escape sequence is wrong and should be
disregarded, and causes immediate sequence termination. Subsequent characters
are not interpreted as part of the control or escape sequence and are processed
normally.</P>
<H3>Substitute (032<SUB>8</SUB>)</H3>
<P>The substitute character is used to indicate replacement of a character that could
not be represented, and causes immediate sequence termination. The SUB character
and subsequent characters are not interpreted as part of a control or escape
sequence and are processed normally.</P>
<H3>Escape (033<SUB>8</SUB>)</H3>
<P>The escape characters are available to user-developed software for font assignment
and invocation and to reset the printer to its initial state (RIS).</P>
<H2>Maintenance</H2>
<P>The LN01 Laser Printer has built-in self-test features for self-diagnosis. The status
code indicator is prominently displayed on the front of the LN01. These status
codes let you know if you need to:</P>
<UL>
<LI>check paper cassettes, handles, or paths</LI>
<LI>wait while fonts are being loaded, or the print engine is warming up</LI>
<LI>add paper or dry imager or</LI>
<LI>determine if an electronic failure has occurred</LI>
</UL>
<P>An operator card, like the one found on many of today's office copiers, details how
to turn on the power, set-up the printer, and add paper, and what the control panel
indicators mean. With the LN01 Laser Printer, there are no bands or ribbons to
change &#8211; or to wear out.</P>
<P>The moisture content of your paper can affect the smooth operation of the
LN01. If the moisture content of your paper is less than six percent, the LN01 will
operate properly. Moisture content above six percent can cause paper jams and
changes in print uniformity. If you live in an area where high humidity is common,
Digital recommends that you remove the paper from the LN01 at the end of the
workday and store the paper in a dry environment or that you purchase an optional
paper tray heater. Both methods will prevent the paper from absorbing excess
moisture.</P>
<H3>Page Count Meter</H3>
<P>The page count meter counts every page delivered to the output tray. This meter
indicates to service personnel when certain print-volume-dependent maintenance
actions are necessary. It is also available for billing purposes if you wish to charge
the cost of operation to different groups within your department or organization.</P>
<H3>Control Panel</H3>
<P>The control panel display is clearly visible and displays any abnormal condition,
which helps you minimize unnecessary service calls. It also aids service personnel
in isolating and repairing faults.</P>
<H3>Simple Offline Diagnostics</H3>
<P>When the LN01 is powered on without the TEST button depressed, the technical
representative can run a simple diagnostic that prints rules paper. By looking at the
output, your service representative can detect faults.</P>
<H3>Power-On Diagnostics</H3>
<P>When system power is turned on, the LN01 laser printer automatically enters the
power-on state of its Online Mode. At that time, self-diagnosing programs are automatically
executed to verify the integrity of the LN01 ESS's microprocessors, memory,
and IOT interfaces. Successful execution of these diagnostics allows the LN01
printer to advance to its ready-to-print state, once the system achieves proper operating
temperature. A summary sheet is then generated. If a failure is detected, the
LN01 ESS posts a failure code on the Control Panel Status Display if the failure does
not prevent it from doing so.</P>
<H3>ESS/IOT Tests</H3>
<P>You or your service representative can request the running of on-line tests that
exercise all components of the printer.</P>
<P>When ESS and IOT tests are active the LN01 does not respond to the host computer.
These tests are performed on-line. When on-line tests are being performed,
the host computer receives no reply if it tries to communicate with the LN01. The
ESS/IOT tests use the LN01's page composition and dynamic font RAM storage.
Starting an on-line test aborts any work in progress and requires the reloading of
dynamic RAM fonts.</P>
<P>The ESS/IOT test includes calibration and character registration adjustment
proof and all black and white page generation. The character proof pages are
printed in the landscape ROM font.</P>
