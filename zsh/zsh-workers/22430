} I suppose the right answer is the \M-x sequence, or whatever called
} execute-named-command, followed by the command name, followed by a
} newline?

I suppose, but that seems excessive.

} Here's a patch that allows you to request that zle sets the widget in
} the way that it does at the top level.  It's actually done by storing
} the global Thingy in the variable bindk, so it's not quite that simple

So ... shouldn't getvirange() do this part too?  What harm could it be?

} +    bindk = t;
}      ret = execzlefunc(t, args);
} +    bindk = savbindk;
