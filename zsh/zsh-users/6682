} But why is there not a blank line?

Because an unquoted empty string always disappears.  It just happens that
the easiest way to get an unquoted empty string is to expand an unset or
empty-valued parameter (the former assuming setopt no_unset).

"Not split" (in the sh_word_split sense) is not equivalent to "quoted".

You'd get strange effects if it didn't work this way; e.g., $* would
always substitute an empty string, even when $# == 0.
