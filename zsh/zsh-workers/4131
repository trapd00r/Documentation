I would like to raise an objection to the variable name MODULE_PATH to 
point towards the zsh modules. Unfortunately `module' is a fairly
common notion and hence MODULE_PATH is not unlikely to be used for
other purposes (in fact at our site we do use it for exactly that). I
would propos some manner of specialisation, perhaps ZSH_MODULE_PATH.
