I agree--definitely keep the old name.  This periodic Lignux/Linux-based
GNU crusade is just petty, and I think the best thing is for package
maintainers to ignore it until RMS gets the message again.

IMHO, anyone who doesn't realize their Linux system contains fully as much
GNU code as will compile on it will be confused, rather than enlightened,
by this attempt to rename the OS.
