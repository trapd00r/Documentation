Ick.  I don't think it's appropriate for root's history to get written
into some other user's SAVEHIST file.  A better solution to this would
probably be to skip writing the history entirely if the file owner is
not the same as the current EUID.

} Attached patch makes zsh restore original permissions/owner/group of
} HISTFILE after sucessful rename. It's against HEAD (4.3) cvs version.

Even if that approach is chosen, the race conditions you mentioned
could be avoided by changing the file attributes *before* renaming it.
