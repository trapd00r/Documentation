This is nothing to do with zsh.  It's a tty settings problem; the system
is confused about your terminal's backspace key, and is probably expecting
it to send ^H.  What you want to do is put

	stty erase '^?'

in your .zprofile file.  I find I actually need more complicated code
that sets the tty erase key to ^? or ^H depending on the terminal type,
because I use several different terminals that send different things, but
if you're only logging on from one place then the above will suffice.
(What I want for Christmas: an operating system that can cope with
multiple erase characters...)
