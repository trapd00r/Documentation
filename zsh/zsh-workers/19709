This isn't so much a bug as a design limitation. It has nothing in
particular to do with the P flag. Note that:
  print ${${bar}[color]}
would print `cat' just like ${${(P)ref}[color]}

Note also:
  % print $bar
  cat apple red

What is happening is that the inner expansion is returning this as an
array of three items. Using [color] as an index is then equivalent to
using [0] because it is taken as a regular array index and hence a math
expression. Note the difference if you assign color=2 first. Ideally,
we would need an explicit (v) for it to work this way.

For this to work, I think we will need the long overdue major changes
to the parameter code. That's because I don't think the nested
expansion code handles anything other than scalars and arrays for the
nested parameters.
