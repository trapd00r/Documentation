Subject: PATCH: zsh-3.1.5-pws-8, configure.in, signal.h, cygwin
Date: Sun, 21 Feb 1999 18:01:19 PST
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain

(patch to configure.in attached via mime so hotmail won't munge the 
text)

Under cygwin, gcc -E spits out include files with path separators of \\.  
They have to be switched to / in order for @SIGNAL_H@ to expand into 
usable values in the various makefile.ins.

I fixed this in patch 5330, but the two calls to sed in that patch are 
combined into one in pws-9.  This doesn't work, since the first sed 
needs the -n arg, while the \\ -> / one doesn't.

http://www.orbs.org, so I must use hotmail.  :-(
