Well, you can always compare `$words[1]' in an `if' or `case' and then 
put the stuff from the #autoloaded functions in the same file and
execute it only if some parameter was set by the tests at the
beginning or something like that.

Never mind. All this isn't fixed in stone yet and the `style-guide' is 
quite new.

P.S.:   And, after all, we are all still learning what is possible with
        the function system.
P.P.S.: The function system started as an attempt to make the syntax
        easier to understand. And now we have a completion function
	that explains what it does by giving an equivalent `compctl' ;-)
