Doesn't help. Nor would I expect it to based on the documentation. It says
nothing about effects on TAB-completion.

Yes. The shell function based completion is slow (ever tried it on a
500MHz machine? That's what I'm writing this message on.) and more
importantly it's too complex for my taste. I don't want all those
completions and I
don't have the time to prune down the default set or start from scratch
to write my own. All I want is some decent filename completion.
