I thought it would be much easier.
This is very simple bug. It occurs due to the incorrect prompt length 
calculations. It reproduces with zsh -f.
% zsh -f
% autoload zcalc
% ZCALCPROMPT="%F{red}%1v%f> "
% echo "$COLUMNS - `echo "${(%)ZCALCPROMPT}" | wc -c`" | bc
67
% zcalc

edit beginning of the line anymore.
