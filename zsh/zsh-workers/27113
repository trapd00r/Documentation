Good point about making the behavior dependent on a non-empty command line, and
that the exit status of command substitution is still important.  I don't see
your patch in CVS yet, so I haven't played with it.  But just from inspection,
it looks like it does not cover these related issues, which are both required by
POSIX to output 0:

$ zsh -c 'false; . /dev/null; echo $?'
1
$ zsh -c 'false; ``; echo $?'
1
