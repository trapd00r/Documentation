You can do

print -l ${(k)_comps}

to show the contexts for which there are completions.  This includes
both command names and special contexts such as
-value-,DISPLAY,-default-  (the value of the DISPLAY environment variable).

print ${_comps[svn]}

will show you if a given command is handled and if so by what function.
