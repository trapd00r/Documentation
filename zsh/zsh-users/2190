Hello,

Here is just another Irix grief. Sorry for that.

I have a zsh 3.1.5 compiled on an Irix 6.3 server machine, installed
at /usr/local/zsh[-3.1.5], and made available to a couple client
O2s via NFS.

Now, one of these O2s is running Irix 6.5 and zsh behave somehow
'strange'.

When it is invoked as /usr/local/bin/zsh, I get a 'bus
error'. Invoking /usr/local/bin/zsh-3.1.5 starts up the shell just
fine. Changing directories and invoking something like
../../../usr/local/bin/zsh works fine, too.

/usr/local/bin/zsh and /usr/local/bin/zsh-3.1.5 are identical,
i.e. they have the same inode.

That looks like it matters how long the 'command path' is and
depending on the length, the shell works or just provides a 'bus
error'.

Does anybody have an idea of what is going on here on how to possibly
solve this behavior? I've never seen anything similar before and am
out of clues.

Best regards,
		Roland
