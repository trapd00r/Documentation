Hi,

I just joined this list and would like to know the answer to a perplexing
problem.  Anytime I set a user to using zsh as their default shell, they
can not ftp into that account.  I could not find a reference to this in any
of the manuals or info texts (but I might have missed it).  Could anyone
please shed some light on this subject?

Also, is there a dotfile generator (a tcl/tk program) module for zshell?
