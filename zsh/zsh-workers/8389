~ % echo $ZSH_VERSION
3.1.6-bart-7
~ % emulate ksh
~ % foo() { typeset -x bar=123; sh -c 'echo $bar' }
~ % foo

~ % emulate zsh; strings =ksh | grep -i version
@(#)Version M-11/16/88i
~ % ksh
venus:281> foo() { typeset -x bar=123; sh -c 'echo $bar'; }
venus:282> foo                                  # note: ^--- is needed
123

So having 'typeset -x' doing 'typeset -xg' seems to be right for 
ksh emulation.
