} This is what I've ended up with for the exec patch.

One thing that rather annoys me about all this is that

	zsh% - exec sh
and
	zsh% exec - sh

seem no longer to be equivalent.  Am I wrong about that?

I'd be inclined to have these -c/-l/-a flags depend on the emulation mode,
or on POSIX_BUILTINS (though they aren't really POSIX, are they?) or on
something else, so that they're not available in default "zsh mode".

(Hmmm:  Make them a zmodload -F feature of the zsh/main module ...?)
