No, it would not be too much work.  In fact, zsh now contains extra code to
aupport {foo and bar}.  There was a beta release before 3.0.0 where I tried
to drop this but there were too much complains.  Maybe we need an option
like BROKEN_ZSH_BRACES :-).  The problem is that some old zsh scripts
define functions as foo(){echo bar} instead of foo () { echo bar; }.
