That's actually a much better plan. I was thinking in terms of keeping
the most common case simple instead of the most general case but I think
you're right.

That'll need patching a lot of files so unless someone else wants to
volunteer I'll try to find time to do it at some stage.

We still need to ask whether the user should need a file-patterns style
to achieve directories after files for the original menu completion
question. Is globbed-files somewhere defaulting to `*'. Should it
perhaps default to `*(.)'? I've not looked at _files but try ^Xh after
something like `cat' or `:' with and without a file-patterns style.
