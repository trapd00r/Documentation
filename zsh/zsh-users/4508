Do you mean the actual directory had a space in its name, or the HOME
variable had a space in it that it shouldn't have?

Either way, compinit should have worked properly.  In the case of the
HOME variable being wrong, it should simply fail to write the dump file.

Can you explain why having a space in your home directory's name caused
this problem?
