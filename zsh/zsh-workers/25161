It's at least consistent with other shells and bc at the moment:

~$ bash -c 'echo $((-2**2))'
4
~$ zsh -c 'echo $((-2**2))'
4
~$ ksh93 -c 'echo $((-2**2))'
4
~$ echo '-2 ^ 2' | bc
4

bc is one place where POSIX specifies the precedence of
unary-minus vs power:
http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/utilities/bc.html
minus has higher precedence than ^ which I have to say is more
intuitive to me.

Having said that:

~$ perl -le 'print -2 ** 2'
-4
~$ python -c 'print -2 ** 2'
-4
~$ ruby -e 'print -2 ** 2'
-4%
~$ gawk 'BEGIN {print -2 ** 2}'
-4

TCL has pow(x, y) instead of an operator.
