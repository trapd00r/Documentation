} I'm persuaded that the rest of the changes were OK.

I was just going through making these same changes in 3.0.6, when I was
brought to a sudden halt by `promptsubst'.  It occurs to me that printing
the prompt can actually cause commands to be executed when `promptsubst'
is set, because of $(...) substitutions.  Depending on what those commands
do, that certainly could affect the behavior of a script.  I suppose it's
not a major issue, but I wanted to ask whether anyone else has an opinion
about it.
