I never thought of that really because I've never use sudo. It could be done with some sort of argument or variable passed down by _sudo and checked for in any completion it would affect, such as _chown and _chflags.

I'm not too sure about that. Presumably -R can be preceded by the other options? In other cases where a certain option is only valid when combined with another, we haven't done anything special like this. If we should then it is a wider issue.
