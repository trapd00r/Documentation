Hey,

I've run into a problem with autocompletion and I can't seem to find =
anything about it from googling. Hopefully someone might be able to =
help.

The situation is this: At work we make fairly heavy use of network home =
directories. In one particular case some important scripts live in =
~foo/bin, however, the actually home directory of ~foo is not =
accessible. This appears to give _path_files a big headache, as trying =
to type the following results in no completion suggestions.

# ~foo/bin/<TAB>

As far as I can tell from my attempts to parse the debugging output, it =
is attempting to traverse ~foo for path expansion? I was attempting to =
look for a way to disable path expansion (the /u/l/b -> /usr/local/bin =
stuff) while leaving normal filename suggestion intact. Either that, or =
a way to alter _path_files such that it doesn't die in this situation.

Any ideas?

Regards,

Matt=
