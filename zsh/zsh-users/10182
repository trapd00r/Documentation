I didn't : my lines was the best i've found.
- haven't thought about the N modifier
- I've tried something like *(om)[1,2] but it naturally failed. didn't 
found the ([x]) in the doc.

but now i'll do mean!

i have noticed that a lot of people here don't use the alternative form. 
is there a reason to not use the next line ?

if (( $+file )) { PROG_SUCCESS $file } else { PROG_FAIL }

BTW, i've tried another way to launch PROG_SUCCESS for the first file 
but it failed because it execute the e:: code for all the files. Peraps 
there is a trick i missed?

% ls
is  score  the  this
% : *(Nom[1]e:echo last file $REPLY:)
last file score
last file score
last file score
last file score
