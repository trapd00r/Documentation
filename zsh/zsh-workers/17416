There's no way otherwise to tell zle to run a function within the
narrowed region, since control goes straight back to the user via the
recursive edit.  The example function is a bit useless, since it just
does a recursive-edit anyway, but in most cases there'll be something
more at that point.  An alternative, instead of -S and -R, would have
been to pass in a function to run on the narrowed region in place of
`zle recursive-edit'.  Unless you can see how to do it some other way.
