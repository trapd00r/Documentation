Has anyone looked into giving Zsh 4dos/4nt style ... expansion in file
name paths so that "..." becomes "../.." and "...." becomes "../../..",
etc.?  It's pretty useful, and might not be too hard.  I've not spent
enough time looking at the various expansion passes to know how feasible
this feature is (and it's not worth if it complicates things much).

Thanks,
Greg
