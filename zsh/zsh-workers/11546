} The master configure script included in zsh v3.0.7 breaks on my NetBSD 1.4.1
} box at line 1356 with the message:

There's nothing special about that case statement and it parsed several far
more complex ones near the top (e.g. the ones that parse the options passed
to configure) without complaint.  So I think that's a red herring.

It's possible that this is a memory problem of some kind, e.g. that either
a hard or soft system limit is being exceeded.  The size of the environment,
the size of the heap or stack, something like that.  In fact, that's the
only explanation I can think of.
