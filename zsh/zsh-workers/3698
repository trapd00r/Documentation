Yes, this is what I did.  I didn't change the scripts themselves, so I guess 
it's possible something got it wrong.

The bash is 1.14.4(1), which may be a bit old.  The zsh I tried is 3.1.2 with 
some patches (mostly Peter's compctl extensions).

In any case, it needs fixing, so I'll stop fiddling with it and wait!
