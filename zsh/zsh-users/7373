Well, yes.  If all one could do with the quoted section was read it,
they'd be fine.

} 
} Yes, that works perfectly. Although

} * I cannot see where I am "using special completion functions, i.e.

You aren't; the completion system is confusing itself somehow, and the
effect of _oldlist is to fool it back into doing what it should have.
 
} * My matcher list[1] should work that way (because of the "+")

I don't know if you read zsh-workers ... but someone else reported a
crash with a matcher-list similar to yours, so it may be that you're
tickling a bug and it's a freak of your environment that zsh goes on
working anyway (or a freak of his that it crashes, who knows).
