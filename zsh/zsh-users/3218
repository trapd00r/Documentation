Sounds interesting. Actually, it looks like more general form of menu
style ... currently we can set it so, that menu selection starts when
matches do not fit on screen; more general style would allow exactly
what you want.

I am perfectly sure it is a matter of one line in the _main_complete; I
just looked where select=long is looked up - should be the right place.
