Sorry to ask such a simple question, but I've been through the whole
documentation without success. 

Is it possible to print a number from, say base 10, to base 2? For
example I want to know how 255 looks in base 2, how do I do that? I know
how to print any number in base 10 with $[16#ff], but the reverse?

Thanks.
