Yep. Thanks!

A change to zshdb's command reading now has this on github (and the -e
mentioned below). I still have some work to integrate better with the
history but that will come later.

I was right - what I had worked out on my own this isn't as robust, simple
or elegant as this solution. Thanks again.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; If the -p flag is given, the following string will be taken as the<br>

You can combine this with &quot;fc -p&quot;/&quot;fc -P&quot; to use a different history in<br>
