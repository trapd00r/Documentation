Please understand correctly. It is most probably Cygwin problem or (even
worse) some Windows "feature". It means finding your way through several MBs
of Cygwin sources or several GBs of MSDN docs. As long as zpty is almost
exclusively used for test suite only, it does not look like high priority
issue.

^Z should be fixed of course, if it is Zsh bug.
