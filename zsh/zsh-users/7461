Hi,


can someone point me to the appropriate configuration:

After typing <return> in the third line, I'm logged out.


-----------------------------------------------------
slash ~/tmp > for i in `find . -name '*.log'`
for> do
for> echo $i
Connection to slash closed.
255 athena ~
-----------------------------------------------------
 

I don't even know which part of my configuration I should post here.
Any hints?

regards, Philipp
