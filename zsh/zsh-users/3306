I appear to have a different problem from you.  I tried removing MMAP (which
I think has been undef'd automatically when compiling against cygwin

Thanks anyway.

Mike

Someone tell me to look at what lists I sending mail to before I send it.
Everything I was talking about is on the cygwin mailing list, not this one.
I have never posted to this one and I do not know if I am blacklisted here.
