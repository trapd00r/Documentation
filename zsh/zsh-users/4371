I received some private replies from Goran and Sven about Clearcase filename
completion back in Sept that I thought I would forward in part to the list. (I
figure there might be a few lurkers who have some interest.)

Check Sven's reply below...

Not sure.  It might be useful to look at the trace output to see what is
happening.  If you use the default bindings, there is a nice completion trace
facility via "^X-?".

One problem I noticed with your completion function is that you use the "-s"
flag with _arguments.  This is used if you have single letter options that can
be combined into a single word (e.g. the ls command allows "ls -la"). 
Clearcase has word options, not letter options, so doesn't need this flag like
cvs does.

In response to a message where I mention some comments Sven had made some time
back in zsh-workers #9631.  He makes a another possible to _path_files.  (I
don't have access to clearcase, so I can't test this...)

-FR.
