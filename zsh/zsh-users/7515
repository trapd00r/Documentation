Yes, it does, at least if you're seeing it in a fixed-width font, which 
I presume you are, since you're using Mutt. The thing on the end of the 
first name is supposed to be a cursive 'n', with some sort of trailing 
stroke after it. I've fiddled around with a it once or twice to try to 
get it to look more like an 'n', but never found anything I really 
liked. It was made by a friend of mine on his DOS box using an old prog 
called CURSIVE.EXE; I've tried to find a comparable font in FIGlet, but 
to no avail.
