 	"States of war are also understood to require the opposition
 	 in the legislature to moderate its otherwise essential
 	 functions of criticism. Calls are issued to stand behind
 	 the political leadership and to display unity, with the
 	 implication that the enemy is watching and that failure to
 	 unite is tantamount to treason. These are not healthy
 	 conditions for a democracy; indeed, they are the opposite of
 	 democracy."
