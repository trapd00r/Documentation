Hi Bob ;),

I'm calling the script using shell globbing to select the set of files. But
you solved my problem with your sample script ;). The problem was that
i wasn't quoting the variable, and thus the spaces were 'compressed'. I
was using the expression: 'command $FILES' when i should be using 'command
"$FILES"'. I didn't know about that zsh behavior with spaces.

Thanks a lot for you help ;)
