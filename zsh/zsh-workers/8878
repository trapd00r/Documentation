} This makes _cd use the tags local-directories and path-directories to
} decide if those in the cwd and/or those in $cdpath should be
} completed.

Is that really a good idea?  In the event that the same name can be
resolved either way, "cd" is always going to change to the same one.
Seeing completions only for one or the other case would be misleading.

This is one case where I think it should always complete them all and
always order the groups the way that "cd" is going to choose them
(that is, local directories first).
