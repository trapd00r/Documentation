Hi Peter,
I saw your fix to a zsh vared bug in the web.
http://www.zsh.org/mla/workers/2003/msg00383.html

Perhaps you can also reproduce and fix another zsh / vared problem.

Version 4.1.1-2, running under cygwin:

$ zsh
$ vared NonExistingVarName
Segmentation fault (core dumped)

Works fine under 4.0.4/Linux.

If you cannot reproduce it, it may be a cygwin problem. I found zsh 
under cygwin quite instable. :-(

Regards,

   Tobias
