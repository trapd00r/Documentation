Ah I had the same problem.

Add this to one of your zsh dotfiles (.zshrc or .zshenv I guess):

# Leave =/&; out of WORDCHARS so ^W acts more nicely 
# -- still not ideal
WORDCHARS='*?_-.[]~\!#$%^(){}<>|`@#$%^*()+:?'

I'm not sure how this works, because the "/" isn't even listed in the 
WORDCHAR, but it does work.

It doesn't seem to stop at the characters as I think it should (it 
doesn't stop at a "." in the middle of a word) but it will stop at the 
"/" as you described (see below)

First Try: luomat@capitalist.princeton.edu
If that fails:  476tjl@ptsmail.ptsem.edu (after Sept 15th 95)
NOTE: 476tjl is ASCII only!!!!!!
