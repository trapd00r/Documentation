I suppose you must be talking about zsh globbing?

I'm not sure precisely what you mean here, but if you're doing something
like

for f in `ls *(wibble)`

then you should change it to

for f in *(wibble)

which saves a process, and a pipe, and will handle special characters
properly.

Not if you link zsh statically and set its sticky bit.

Really, with demand-loading, particularly if you use zsh's module feature
(3.1+), there shouldn't be a great deal of difference.  I suggest you
experiment.
