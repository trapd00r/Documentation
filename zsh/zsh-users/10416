I am compelled to disagree.  I already have had use for it to do
something that would have been much less neat in tkirc.  Consider...

zirc_msg "Some relevant ./configure options:"
for opt in config bin include includeserver lib pkglib; do
  zirc_msg "option --with-pg-${opt}dir=3D<dir>"
done

I thought that was way cool :-).

Oddly enough, this is completely standard behaviour for shells. This
is a roundabout way of saying `don't use combined chains of `&&'s and
`||'s unless you think G=F6del's theorem is for sissies'.
