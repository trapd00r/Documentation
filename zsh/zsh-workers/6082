I've played with this a bit, trying to remember the things we fixed in 
the completion code in 3.1.5. I seem to remember that one of the
patches I sent after 4988 (which is the last entry with my name in it
in the ChangeLog) fixed something that might be buggy in
3.0.[56]. Unfortunately I forgot to write myself a note about this and
I can't remember what it was.
Hm, maybe everyone who sent a bug-report about old-style completion to 
the list could try it with Bart's pre-3.0.6 version?

I'll continue to search, too.

Bye
 Sven
