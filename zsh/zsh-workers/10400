Right. zrecompile should be a bit more clever to handle error
conditions, though.

And another thing: the zwc files till use $ZSH_VERSION in the header
to test for compatibility -- somehow I didn't like to add an additional 
version number scheme for them, but it would be better, I think (the
format will certainly change less often than $ZSH_VERSION).

No patch, I'm still compiling the thing from CVS...

Bye

P.S.: Sourceforge Bug #103797 can be closed, it seems. It also seems
      that only administrators can do that.
