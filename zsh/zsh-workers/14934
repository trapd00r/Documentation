Subject: Is PRINT_EXIT_VALUE supposed to work?
Date: Fri, 15 Jun 2001 14:22:04 +0100
From: Peter Stephenson <pws@csr.com>

I've never looked at this option until now, when I'm trying to write a test
for it.  It doesn't work with functions.

% setopt printexitvalue
% false
zsh: exit 1
% func(){ false; }
% func
%

It seems to come from csh, so we can more or less invent our own usage
model in cases like this.  But I don't think the above is good enough.

(I never used to use phrases like `usage model' when I was physicist.  Oh,
well.)
