Hi!

When upgrading from zsh 3.1.6 to 3.1.6-dev-17 (as found in the Mandrake
zsh-3.1.6dev17-1mdk rpm), I was sad to notice that the glob behaviour of
the pattern <number> had changed to something identical to what I had
earlier (and still can) specified as <number->, that is, an open range of
numbers, from number onwards.

The old behaviour is, luckily, still available as <n-n> (although with
some extra pointless repetitive typing), but I rather liked the syntactic
simplicity of <n>, especially since <-n> or <n-> both are easy typers and
good for their purposes. <n> isn't useless, if (s)he who changed its=20
behaviour thought so, since it matches all the number n with any amount of
leading zeroes, a feature I have daily use for, when rummaging through
huge log directories, for instance.

Is this behaviour still there in the cvs version? On purpose? Any chance
of getting back the old style "syntactic sugar" pattern look?
