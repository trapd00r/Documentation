What has inserting all *completions* to do with *expansions* (and thus
_expand_word)? Even less than with _expand completer. IM very strong O this
simply should be another widget.

I am sorry, I was a bit off this list and leaved _insert_all_completion
unfinished. But I still like the idea of respecting existing list (so you
could use it not only initially) and it needs some guard against
_correct/_approximate (where generated lists are not much useful for
insertion).
