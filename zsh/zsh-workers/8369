Ugh. The completion code doesn't try to do that at all, right.

You can try the (probably expensive):

  compmatchers=('r:|?=* r:|=*')

of course. This works for me at least with your example. Another way
would be to try completion again and again while moving the
cursor. But that would even be more expensive.
