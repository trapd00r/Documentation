(No, I've modified the _cd completer a bit to only add $cdpath things
if the first component is already typed out, because when I'm sitting
in a dir with only one subdir and type cd <tab> i would like that
directory completed and not the 50 ones in my cdpath. I used to have a
~/code symlink to point to where my code dir really is, and both ~ and
that dir is in my $cdpath. This causes listings of this type though:
% cd code/<tab>
---- local directory
zsh/
---- directory in cdpath
zsh/

and this was mostly a feeble attempt to get around that by removing
the symlink and readding it as a fake directory.)

Thanks for the explanation, I gather that I can probably not make it
work easily, so for now I think I'll just put the symlink back :).
Actually, mkdir code does what I want...

Of course, my real question should have been if I can make the
completion listing remove duplicate entries when I have both a real
directotry and an entry in cdpath that matches, but I guess if you
have a real dir foo/bar and a cdpath dir foo/baz you want to be able
to complete to foo/baz too. Maybe it doesn't have to show up as a
cdpath entry at the foo point though, since the cd builtin won't
actually go there anyway?
