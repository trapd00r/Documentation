Hi again,

I found that the error was my fault (I wrote "read -n 0" instead of 
"read -u 0" to read from stdin). Anyway, I think there should be no 
NULL-pointer exeption :)

I forgot: ZSH version is 4.2.5 i686-pc-linux-gnu.

I'll be thankful for any information about this bug :)

Good night,

Jonas
