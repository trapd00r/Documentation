I had tried, in fact.  The test I did (by accident) was

zsh% maiql<TAB>

expecting it to complete to "mailq", which it did not -- it feeped.  After
peering at _main_complete for a bit, I tried

zsh% echo =maiql<TAB>

and got a list of about a dozen possible corrections, which is why I
brought it up.  However, now that I've rebuilt with all the latest
patches, it is working the same in both places.
