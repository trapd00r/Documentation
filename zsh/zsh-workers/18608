I've noticed a lot of problems connecting to the anonymous cvs server
for zsh updates lately.  Does anyone have an opinion on whether we ought
to move the zsh sources elsewhere?

Subject: [SAtalk] SpamAssassin anonymous CVS out of date
Date: Sat, 14 Jun 2003 15:34:13 -0700

FYI - the anonymous SpamAssassin CVS tree at sourceforge.net is almost
two days hours old (versus the developer tree) due to worsening CVS
problems at SourceForge.

  http://sourceforge.net/docman/display_doc.php?docid=2352&group_id=1#cvs

We plan on migrating CVS to a better server.

Daniel

P.S. If you have any projects on SourceForge, it seems like it's time to
get the hell out of Dodge.
