Hi

I just started to use zsh, so this might sound like a newbie question.
I searched with google for a solution,  but could not find anything.
Here's my problem:

I'm trying to write a completion. All the possible arguments are in a
predefined array. Because the elements are quite complex, I want to have
a completion that works  by giving a substring of an element. All the
completions that I've found so far (e.g. file completion), demand that
the completion starts from the first letter.

 Is there a utility function to acomplish this? The man pages are
"quite" complex, so I might have overlooked something...
