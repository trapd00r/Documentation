Thanks Peter!  This patch resolves the problem.

(I quote the whole message because apparently it was not CC'ed to
zsh-wokers.)

Unfortunately I don't quite understand unicode issues in zsh.  I build
zsh rpm package because I use it (and a few others use it, too).  The
latest stable 4.2 release had problems in utf8 console, so I decided
to move to then-current cvs snapshot.  I got my first decently working
utf8-enabled zsh with 20050926 snapshot.

So as for now there's just about the only thing I can provide is feedback.
This will change as I grok zsh code.

BTW, git archive is available at
git://git.altlinux.org/people/at/packages/zsh.git
The 'master' branch is for my own cooking, but "cvs" branch, as well
as "zsh-4_0-patches" and "zsh-4_2-patches" have pristine zsh sources.
I verified "cvs" branch against checkout, and it's almost zero-diff
(the only exception is that there's very old Completion/Core/_closequotes
is in there, but is not in checkout).  I used Keith Packard's "parsecvs"
(with my changes, some of which already merged into mainline).
