There are two problems with that.  First I've modified the lexer so that
!, [[, { and } are reserved words now.  This means that these must be
delimited.  So {echo} no longer works, { echo } should be used instead.
Similarily [[-z $foo]] does not work, [[ -z $foo ]] should be used.

The other problem is that this depends on READNULLCMD being cat.
$(<...) always works since it is always recognized as a special command
substitution.  That's why the 2> redirection does not work in that case
(but a space between `(' and `<' fixes that problem).

It's simply

 	"${pref}${^${${(f@)$({<${pref}CVS/Entries} 2>/dev/null)}#/}%%/*}"

Are you sure that there is not empty element in the reply?  The above
`parameter expansion' always produces at least one element.
