I think we now have entirely too many topics going on that all have the
subject "Re: PATCH: completion".

} Ah, sorry, I didn't test it with `[(I)...]'. So I think this is a real

} `[(I)...]' and `[(R)...]' was pure oversight, though.

It was oversight in that I didn't consider it; but either the patch you
sent is correct or else it's going to cause a core dump at subst.c:1713 

	    i = 1;
	    /* aval[1] is non-null here */
	    while (aval[i + 1]) {

in some circumstances that I'm not able to predict offhand.  I tend to
think it'll be OK.
