Oh that's a nice way to discard both the question and consideration for =
non-mainstream OSes (or should I say "anything non-linux" ?).

I ran many shell/perl/python/=85 scripts in BeOS and Haiku for years =
without much trouble.
Not that much as with people thinking using autofools makes their apps =
automagically portable but forget to test for libm.

I've ported mercurial to BeOS & Haiku, and, co=EFncidentally the only =
thing I had to change was exactly this #!/usr/bin/env python crap.
And it works very well (unlike git which was ported but is as unusable =
as on linux :p).
