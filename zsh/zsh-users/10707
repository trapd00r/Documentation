Well in this case the alias does not pass its args
to the program. The alias is just expanded and the
whole line is passed to 'echo' by the shell.

You could obtain what you want with a shell
function:

% foo() { echo lol; }
% foo a b
lol
% 

It doesn't make much sense to do it with an alias
anyway. Unless I'm missing something...
