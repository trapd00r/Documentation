I have multiple perforce clients, under a common area, sometimes with
common directories from the depot mapped.  It's *very* convenient, when
five levels deep inside the client, to be able to switch to the
corresponding directory in another client.  Often, it's as simple as:

% cd 1 2

Imagine paths like:
  /home/me/p4/client1/hierarchy/java/com/example/project/sub-system/component/
to get the full impact.
