I had a vague feeling it would involve something like `pushing the
ttdwim module atop the STREAMS stack', or something.

The docs on the Sun website imply all the configuration is done by
standard termios; I haven't found anything which has the appropriate
effect.  I tried making the tcsetattr() use TCSANOW instead of
TCSADRAIN, but that didn't seem to help.

I think this is going to have to stay, but I'd be interested to know if
other systems show this behaviour.
