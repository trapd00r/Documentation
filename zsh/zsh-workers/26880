} There seems to be a spurious debug print statement left in

} Should/can this be removed?

I see that PWS committed this, but I think that was wrong.  That print
has always been there since the first revision of run-help, and is not
a spurious debugging statement.

It's intended to make sure that useful output is produced in the event
that the case-statement that follows it branches off into an unexpected
place or outputs nothing.  For example, with that "builtin print"
statement present:

schaefer[524] ls<ESC-h>
schaefer[524] run-help ls
ls is an alias for ls -CF
Press any key for more help or q to quit

At this point if you press anything other than "q", you get the manual
page for "ls".

With that "builtin print" removed:

schaefer[526] ls<ESC-h>
schaefer[526] run-help ls
Press any key for more help or q to quit

Umm, no.

Please back out this change.
