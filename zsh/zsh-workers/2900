} This for specific commands?  It works for me, eg.  fc -W >(cat)

Hmm.  Looks like it only locks up if you use -I, e.g., fc -WI >(cat) is
one of the commands that locks up for me.  I thought I'd tried it both
with and without -I, but maybe I'd only tried both -W and -A with -I.

} Are you getting this both in older and newer versions?

Yes, if I put the -I in there.
