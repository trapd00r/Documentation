I do not see why.  You can always use fg $foo explicitely.

I know that (but cflags should be used instead of cmd->flags).  But there
is an other problem.  With your patch \%1 also triggers autoresume so it is
not possible to execute a command beginning with a % (but correct me if I'm
wrong, I did not try your patch).

foo=%1 ; $foo never worked and noone complaind about it.
