Subject: PATCH: quoting in compctl

There's a "compcall" somewhere in the code that searches for scripts
after "zsh":  it displayed a bug with quoting in compctl.

I wimped out setting instring to QT_BACKSLASH since it affects the
test for instring being non-zero, instead I've just passed QT_BACKSLASH
instead of QT_NONE via quotename().  This is a bit more verbose since
that's a macro.
