You want ${myvar:h}.  When you use globbing syntax, it turns the whole
expression into a pattern match, so you get the unwanted side effect.
When you use variable syntax that doesn't happen.

 If a `tt(:)' appears in a qualifier list, the remainder of the expression in
 parenthesis is interpreted as a modifier (see noderef(Modifiers)
-in noderef(History Expansion)).  Note that
-each modifier must be introduced by a separate `tt(:)'.  Note also that the
-result after modification does not have to be an existing file.  The
-name of any existing file can be followed by a modifier of the form
-`tt((:..))' even if no actual filename generation is performed.
