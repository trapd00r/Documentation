Aha. So it would mostly be a matter of cut'n'paste to stuff all the
symbols needed into those files (removing the dots, which seem to be
the prefix AIX puts before functions(?)). And maybe we could even do
some makefile magic to generate them automatically.

The `hasexport' seems to trigger only the `EXPIMP_' stuff in the makefiles.

Bye
