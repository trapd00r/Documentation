After all patches I started zsh and found this ma capability working :-) A small
comment - I think, it is better to highlight just the current item. Currently,
the highlighted area corresponds to the longest item possible. Example:

bor@itsrm2:/tools/var%> l /var/adm/log/messages
memory_messages   messages
                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                  Highlighted area

Looks a bit confusing.

And I agree, either this should be off by default, or some (easy) way to turn it
off is needed (easy, I mean - I can set ma to back/foreground colors, but this
is ugly). I have empty ZLS_COLORS.

But, folks, this *is* great!
