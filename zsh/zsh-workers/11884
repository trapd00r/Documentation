Hmm, I just noticed that it's not working for me, either.  <C-x?> output
shows that MENUSELECT=6 is happening at _main_complete line 217, and the
number of matches is 71, and the complist module is loaded.

There's this odd bit:

+_main_complete:152: nm=71
+_main_complete:154:if: [[  == keep || nm -gt 1 ]]
+_main_complete:155:then: [[ _last_nmatches -ge 0 && _last_nmatches -ne nm ]]
+_main_complete:156:then cmdand: _menu_style=( select=6  )
+_main_complete:158:then: tmp=27
+_main_complete:160:then: _menu_style=( select=6  select=6 )

Why is it in there twice?  Doesn't seem to be the cause of the problem.
