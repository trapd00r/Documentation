Subject: BUG: mplayer -stop_xscreensaver replaced with -stop-xscreensaver

Hi, Zsh-Workers,

i found an old bug in the completion of mplayer.

mplayer had -stop_xscreensaver but for a long time (2005 or even longer) that has been exchanged with
-stop-xscreensaver and mplayer quits executing if given that flag
with the error: "Use -stop-xscreensaver instead, options with _ have been obsoleted."
mplayer -monitor_vfreq, -monitor_hfreq and -monitor_dotclock
are obsoleted, too but are still completed that way.

_mplayer should reflect that change now, i think.
