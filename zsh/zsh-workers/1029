But not all of us do this.  I almost never use a separate directory.
We must at least allow for the possibility.

The way I use CVS, any file that can be generated (including
config.h.in and stamp-h.in) does not go into the repository.  In fact,
I do a "make superclean" before importing sources.  I find that this is
the best way to use CVS, as one doesn't end up with redundant diffs of
generated files.
