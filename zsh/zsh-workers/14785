Yes, possibly we should distinguish explicitly by checks in module.c
between modules which provide features directly (builtins, parameters,
etc.) and those which only exist as a dependency to provide support for
other modules.  Then we can tell what it's safe to unload.  Currently
modules are either one or the other --- maybe we can get away with keeping
it like this.
