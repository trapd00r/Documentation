I've tried the following with zsh-4.3.4-dev-4:

$ Src/zsh -f -c 'emulate sh; set -o foo; echo "Didn''t abort ($?)"'
set: no such option: foo
Didn't abort (0)

This is incorrect. The shell should abort as 'set' is a special
builtin[*]:

$ ksh93 -c 'set -o foo; echo "Didn''t abort ($?)"'
ksh93[1]: set: foo: bad option(s)
Usage: set [-sabefhkmnprtuvxBCGH] [-A name] [-o[option]] [arg ...]
zsh: exit 2     ksh93 -c 'set -o foo; echo "Didn't abort ($?)"'

See also the discussion on:
  http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=452972

And in an interactive shell, "set -o foo" should return with a
non-zero exit status.

Please check the other special builtins:
