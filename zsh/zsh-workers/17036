I meant to answer but forgot. I prefer to not exporting zputenv(); it
was meant as internal wrapper only. The proper function to add
environment is actually addenv(). Zputenv() does not free old string; it
does not matter in this case (as we are going to exec/exit anyway) but
if it is exported people could start using it.
