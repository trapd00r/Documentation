                                    4 Set-Up

Overview

   The VT320 has seven set-up screens that list the settings for the
   terminal's operating features.
     * Set-Up Directory
     * Display
     * General
     * Communications
     * Printer
     * Keyboard
     * Tab

   You can display these screens and change settings from the keyboard.
   This chapter describes the set-up screens and how to change settings.

   Most set-up features are initially set to a factory-default setting
   that works with most Digital systems. The VT320 has these
   factory-default settings permanently stored. If you change settings,
   you can use set-up to reset the terminal to the factory-default
   settings.

   You can also select and save settings to match your host system. The
   VT320 saves your selections in nonvolatile memory, along with the
   factory-default settings. When you shut power off, you do not lose your
   saved settings.

   You can change all set-up features from the keyboard. Your host system
   can also change some settings, as described in the VT320 Programmer
   Reference Manual. See Appendix B to order other VT320 manuals.

Entering and Leaving Set-Up

   To enter or leave set-up, you press the Set-Up key (the third key from
   the left on the top row of the main keypad). When you enter set-up, any
   text on the screen disappears, and the Set-Up Directory appears. When
   you leave set-up, the text that was on the screen reappears.

   The Set-Up Directory lists all the set-up screens. You can select any
   set-up screen from the Set-Up Directory. You can also move from screen
   to screen. You can return to the Set-Up Directory from any set-up
   screen. You can only display one set-up screen at a time.

Set-Up Screen Format

   The terminal displays set-up screens on the bottom third of the screen.
   Figure 4-1 shows the set-up screen format.

   CAPTION: Figure 4-1 Set-Up Screen Format

How to Change Settings

   You use the arrow keys to move the set-up cursor to a particular
   feature on a set-up screen. Most features have two or more possible
   settings. You use the Enter key to change the setting of the feature
   highlighted by the cursor. Each time you press Enter, the setting
   changes. Depending on the feature, the change takes effect immediately
   or when you leave set-up.

   Some features are action fields. When you move to an action field and
   press the Enter key, the terminal performs the action. For example, six
   of the set-up screens have an action field that reads To Directory.
   When you move to this feature and press Enter, the Set-Up Directory
   screen replaces the current screen.

   Example
   This example shows how to change the screen display from 80 to 132
   columns.
    1. Press Set-Up to enter set-up. The Set-Up Directory appears. The
       cursor is on the Display field.
    2. Press Enter. The Display Set-Up screen appears.
    3. Use the arrow keys to move the cursor to "80 Columns". Press Enter
       to change the setting to "132 Columns".
    4. Press Set-Up to leave set-up.

   When you change a feature setting, the VT320 uses that setting until
   you turn the terminal off or change the setting again. To save a new
   setting, read the next section.

How to Save Your Settings

   You can save the feature settings you select. When you do, the VT320
   automatically uses your settings each time you turn the terminal on. In
   this way, you can set the VT320 to your computing environment.

   You use the Save feature to save your settings. After you change
   settings to match your host computer, return to the Set-Up Directory.
   Use the arrow keys to move the cursor to the Save feature, then press
   Enter. The VT320 saves all current set-up settings and displays a
   "Done" message on the status line. The terminal uses these settings
   until you or an application save a new set of settings.

   If you temporarily change some settings without saving them, you can
   Recall your last set of saved settings from the Set-Up Directory.

Status Line

   The status line shows you the current position of the screen cursor,
   the printer status, and the modem status (if used). Table 4-1 describes
   the three status line fields, from left to right. The status line
   appears on line 25 at the bottom of the screen. If you display the
   status line outside of set-up, the line appears in reverse video.

   By default, the status line only appears in set-up. You can use the
   Status Display feature in the Display Set-Up screen to control the
   status line. The feature has three settings.

   No Status Display
   (default) The status line appears only in set-up or when selected by
   the host system.
   Indicator The status line appears at all times.
   Host-Writable The host system can write messages in place of the status
   line.

   You can display the indicator status line in English, French, or
   German. Use the Set-Up Language feature in the Set-Up Directory screen
   to select the language.

   keyboard.
