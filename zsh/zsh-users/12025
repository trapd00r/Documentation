As Bart noted earlier in this thread, history writes occur once per
command anyway for users with SHARE_HISTORY or INC_APPEND_HISTORY set.
And a solution handled during a history write can't be handled
directly in shell code.  That's exactly what my suggestion was aimed
at avoiding.  The only advantage I can see to handling it in C would
be that it would add only one extra instruction for an unexceptional
write (if (errno != ...) ) instead of the full cost of a glob and
a parameter expansion, which are presumably much more expensive.  But,
either way, I'm still against this proposed feature; I still find it
to be unnecessary at best.
