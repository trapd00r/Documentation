Sorry to be a bit late responding to this, I was traveling ...

Did you really mean to remove "static" there?  With that removed, the
"if (openmax < 1)" will ALWAYS be true, so there's no point in testing
it -- but the intention of having openmax be static was so that once
it's determined, we know what it is and never probe it again.

That is, on certain platforms I think you've traded startup-time
inefficiency for later run-time inefficiency.
