Subject: 3.1.6-test-1: configure --enable-static no longer means --disable-dynamic?
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

I was sure this worked at one time, but maybe it worked only because using
--enable-dynamic was not the default.  In any event, either --enable-static
should work, or the configure help should report --disable-dynamic rather
than --enable-dynamic as an option, or both.
