Normally it doesn't show options that haven't changed from their
default setting.  For options, it's probably easiest to set the
kshoptionprint option.  However, you could also look at the options
associative array from the zsh/parameter module; it's probably already
loaded by completion.

For variables, set should certainly find everything, but you might want
to use typeset or one of its synonyms since it gives more information
about the type of the variable.
