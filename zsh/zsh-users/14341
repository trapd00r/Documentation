} the doisearch() function already takes a 'pattern' argument that

That'd also introduce a dependency into a part of the code that has
never required a regular expression library before.

It'd be better to have doisearch call out to a shell function at that
point to do the comparison, then you could write your own search
algoritms.  Unclear whether that'd be acceptably fast, though.
