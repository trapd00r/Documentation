Yes, right.

For now I've just copied it into the script.

I've always thought that these are almost not worth a separate
function file.  Because of that I think `Examples' is fine.

So should I change it to our normal format while moving it?

There's the problem that the file then wouldn't work as a script
(because currently the `#autoload' has to be in the first line, this
could be changed, though).

Btw. is hard-wiring /usr/local/bin/zsh a good idea? And others say
`#! /bin/sh'.

We've been talking once or twice about a more general sub-system
configuration and autoloading mechanism.  And it's still on my list.
Then we just had the discussion about the completion directories.

Maybe we could try to collect ideas after 4.0, come up with a generic
mechanism for auto-loading and installing packages (or sub-packages)
and then convert all functions in the distribution as needed,
integrating Peter's work on config.modules.


Ok, things left:

- possible renaming of the Functions/Misc directory
- possible renaming of the tag- and label-completion-functions
- renaming of the files in Test

Changing top-level directory names to their singular forms seems to
not have been considered anymore.


Bye
 Sven
