} Our cp does not support -f.

} why not just use 'rm -f' before the 'cp'

Indeed, why not.

} I'm not actually clear on when the '-f' flag would be needed....

The file is a symlink?  Somebody else owns it, but the build directory is
writable by you?

I'm not sure why it needs to be "cp" though.  Why not "mv -f" instead?

However, this patch just does the "rm -f" thing.
