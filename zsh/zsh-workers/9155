It is correct, that arguments, that are command line, need splitting (to get at
this command line at all :-) But the current way to split them prevents any
arguments with embedded LFS characters.

What about something like

eval "action=( $action )"

Then we could define

_alternative 'files::_files -W "(a b c)"'

i.e. just use usual quoting.

Note, that this (possibly - I did not check the code) applies to _arguments,
_values etc - to any function, that is possibly using this format. It seems that
a single utility function/builtin to habdle such arguments is quite timely.
