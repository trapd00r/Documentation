Here's a test that the two pseudorandom number generators, $RANDOM and
rand48(),  are probably wired up correctly.  There's a more detailed
test of the logic for rand48() elsewhere.

This is not designed to test the distribution in a mathematically
sophisticated way, just that the function is producing something which
is more likely to be pseudorandom than, say, the temperature or the
number of bugs in the firmware.

(There are no bugs in our firmware, of course.)

If there are no comments about the parameter patch (e.g. "what the hell
is this?") I will check it in this afternoon GMT.
