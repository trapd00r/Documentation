Just in case somone might need it there is an excellent Win32 port of
zsh-3.1.2-test1 available at http://www.tiac.net/users/cgf/

Lately I've been forced to use Win95 on a client's site and this zsh
port has made the experience pleasant (well almost ;-).

It requires the Cygnus DLL and a termcap file to function properly. The
best is to install the Cygnus "user tools" package. Let's encourage the
porter, it might save someone else's day :-)
