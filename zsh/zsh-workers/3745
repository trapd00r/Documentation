I am working with dynaload since it first appeared (zsh-3.1.0) and haven't
got any noticable problems (apart from initial build quirks - but they
should be sorted now).

As for your question ... A dynamically loaded module can currently provide
new builtin and zle widget. It cannot e.g. add new option, new completion
rule or like. And it definitely cannot change/extend syntax and/or
grammar. So, if you Objetive-Z fits in additional builtin paradigm - yes,
it is doable now. But if you planned to extend grammmar to add Objective C
- I am afraid, not.
