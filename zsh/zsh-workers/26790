I should also have pointed out that the "emulate sh" doesn't make any
difference, it only takes effect after the string for -c has already been
parsed---it's basically the same issue as the alias expansion one itself.
You would need to start the shell in the appropriate mode.  I don't think
that's an unreasonable requirement.

Is the fix as simple as the following?  This is not a trick question, I
could very easily have missed something.

+Another effect of this option, provided it is set at shell start up,
+is to cause the shell's tt(-c) option to save commands to a temporary file
+and read them line by line to ensure aliases are expanded.  For example,
+
+example(zsh -fc 'alias o="echo Hello"
+o')
+
+reports a `command not found' error, while
+
+example(zsh -o posixaliases -fc 'alias o="echo Hello"
+o')
+
+outputs `Hello'.
+
 Alias expansion takes place while text is being read; hence when this
 option is set it does not take effect until the end of any function or
 other piece of shell code evaluated as one unit.
