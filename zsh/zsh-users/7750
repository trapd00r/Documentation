This isn't really recent, but probably the most common thing I do in 
zsh that can't be done anywhere else is use the advanced globbing 
stuff. For instance, I have a (fairly large) directory tree that I use 
to categorize and store incoming files that need to be processed, after 
which they get moved to archival directories through symlinks located 
in each "leaf" directory. Determining whether I have any files waiting 
for processing thus involves doing a recursive check for plain files 
only below the root of this tree. In bash, this would either be a 
significant amount of shell scripting effort or a rather ugly "find" 
command. (I hate find.) In zsh, it's "ls **/*(.)". Isn't that nice?
