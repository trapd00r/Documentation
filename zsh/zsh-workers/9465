We discussed locale usage recently.  I think this is the only type
of locale usage that would be uncontroversial.  It's just a matter of
someone producing the (inevitably large) code patch, and someone doing
translations.

The awk script does a lot besides just generating prototypes.  And we
can't rely on cproto being available on every build system (I don't have
it here, for example, and this is a recent Red Hat).

That's something I'm planning.  There's some work to do with modules
first.

It's the zsh license -- it's unique to zsh.  Its effect is pretty much
identical to the BSD license, so you could reasonably describe it as
"BSD-like".

I'd much rather we used one of the standard licenses (and actually I've
changed my mind recently and come to quite like the GPL).  But we've
already changed the license twice that I remember, and it's a complex
issue, so I don't see us switching any time soon.
