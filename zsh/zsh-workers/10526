I've installed cvs2cl in /home/groups/zsh/bin on zsh.sourceforge.net.

Here's some sample output, just the top few entries.  If we actually include
the article numbers in our commit logs (as pws did in the first one), then
the only other thing is to replace sourceforge user identities with useful
email addresses in the tag lines.  (And edit out all of "akr"s one-liners
from before the sourceforge site was up.)

Note that I recommend that you don't allow cvs2cl to rewrite ChangeLog on
its own; rather, use "cvs2cl --stdout", lop off the bottom bit that is
already reflected in ChangeLog, and then paste the top bit into ChangeLog.

BTW, Peter, it'd be nice if commitlogs say what actually happened to the
source rather than just pointing at zsh-workers articles.  Yes, the rest of
the information is in the ChangeLog, but it's still be nice.
