Subject: PATCH: default completion for X


Just had a look at deja.com and found a message form someone
complaining that completion for X command does not ccomplete filenames 
as the default.

I think we can use the patch below which makes filenames only be
completed if _x_arguments is called without arguments (i.e. from
_normal).


Bye
 Sven
