You might want to take a look at Cygwin, which is now fully supported, for
various values of `fully'.  Cygwin is easily downloadable (more or less, er,
fully automated) from sources.redhat.com, and zsh will compile out of the
box.  This gives you a complete UNIX environment, which zsh running under
native Windows doesn't.  However, it's not that fast.  The comparison
between zsh running under Linux and under Windows 98/Cygwin on the same box
is painful (although the two words in the middle are probably the main
culprit).
