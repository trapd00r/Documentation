} I think this is deliberate.  You're supposed to run `make prep' when
} you add a new module.

Hm.  But ... I applied Clint's zsh/db module patch and just ran "make"
and that one correctly got picked up and included in config.modules.
And then I applied the patch in reverse (because I don't have libdb-4,
and I was only testing whether it would correctly omit the module in
that case, which it doesn't) and ran "make" again, and zsh/db vanished.

The config.modules code in zshconfig.ac does

    for modfile in `cd ${srcdir}; echo */*.mdd */*/*.mdd`; do

so I'm baffled as to why that needs "make prep".  Note that I'm not
complaining that the module didn't get compiled (that is, that Makemod
was not up to date -- I know "make prep" runs mkmakemod), but that it
didn't even get _mentioned_ in config.modules.

It's entirely likely that this is just something I'm missing and not really
a glitch, but I don't think "make prep" is the culprit.
