Subject: strictly literal command lines?
From: Eric De Mund <ead@ixian.com>
Reply-To: Eric De Mund <ead@ixian.com>

Hello,

I'd like to be able to issue a command without any quotation characters
or with only one quotation character at the beginning. Is this possible
in zsh (ignore my line breaks here, done manually for legibility)?

    % wget http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/04/world/europe/04levistrauss\
    .html?hp=&pagewanted=print

In this particular example, the "&" is the problem for me. I want it
taken literally.

I can envision two kinds of solutions right off the bat.

1.  Is there a "literal-to-end-of-line" character? If the single quote
    (') were such a character, the command would look like this:

        % wget 'http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/04/world/europe/04levist\
        rauss.html?hp=&pagewanted=print

2.  Or is there an option to make a command line completely literal,
    akin to noglob but stronger, in order to handle ampersands (&)s and
    anything and everything else, too:

        % literal wget http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/04/world/europe/0\
        4levistrauss.html?hp=&pagewanted=print

Or am I missing some way of accomplishing this that already exists in
zsh?

Thanks,
Eric
