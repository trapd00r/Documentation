} Zsh compilation bombs out when /bin/sh symlink is pointing to zsh.

Recent changes to autoconf have tickled a couple of problems in zsh's sh
emulation. I think the one you're running into is fixed by zsh-workers/17357.
There is another that was worked around by the autoconf maintainers, so if
you are still having problems either after applying that patch or after
4.0.5 comes out, you'll have to try upgrading autoconf.
