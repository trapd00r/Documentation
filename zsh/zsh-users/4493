It's not really aliasing a particular pattern of quoting.  It's aliasing
an arbitrary string of characters before quoting is stripped.  From the
viewpoint of aliases, `\ls' is not really quoting the `l'; it's simply
not the same word as `ls' at the time aliases are resolved, and therefore
doesn't match an alias for `ls'.
