I've have been given permission by the original copyright holder
to change the copyright of zsh to a Berkeley style copyright.
This change happened after the release of zsh-2.5.03, but
the beta releases for the next release contain this type of
copyright message.  I don't know the timetable for the Debian
group, but I would suggest either wait for the next release, or
use zsh-2.6-beta12 in their distribution (beta12 is already more
stable than the last production release).  There is precedent
for this, as the FreeBSD group uses zsh-2.6-beta10 in their
ports collection.

If you have any more questions about this, you can send them directly
to me.
