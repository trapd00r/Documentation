Completion in minibuffer looks pretty basic. I just tried to complete widget
name in execute-named-cmd and it cannot even grok e-o-c-p.

Probably we could add additional context "minibuffer" and additional parameter
describing what is expected ... somewhat vague, I know. But after all wizzos of
completion one is disappointed not having it in all places :-)
