In part it depends upon the OS, locale and what happens for unprintable
characters for you.

For me, that's hex [92  77  94  69], shown as [\   M   ^   E].

Yes.  Looks like another one I introduced, I never tested the
interaction of "exec -a foo" with a variable as foo.

Unfortunately, my understanding of zsh's internal parse state is weak
enough that I don't know the fix.  Somewhere in the BINF_EXEC handling,
I *think* that some kind of unmeta() is needed, but my naive approaches
have not worked.
