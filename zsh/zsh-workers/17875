Are you sure this was a problem?  The internal value is a start time,
and the value returned is relative to "now", so it seems to me that as
long as the parent's SECONDS value is saved/restored literally when
localized that there is no need to fudge the value at all.  Perhaps the
bug is that the value is being saved/restored relative to "now"?  (I
haven't looked at the local-variable code enough to know for sure.)
