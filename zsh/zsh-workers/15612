I mentioned this once before, on a tangentially related thread, but nobody
responded.

The FAQ section 2.3 says (and has for a long time):

	Luckily, it is not possible to define `function' as an alias.

I don't know at exactly what point that statement became false, but:

zagzig% alias function=for  
zagzig% set a b c
zagzig% function x { echo $x }
a
b
c
zagzig% 

Either the code or the FAQ needs fixing.  I lean slightly to the code.
