Could you provide example of script that exibits an error?

Well, I cannot comment on stock 3.1.9 at all. Current CVS version does work;
3.1.9-dev-6 should work OOTB if you have recent enough Cygwin version (with
one minor problem). I use (and ported it :-) under cygwin-1.1.4 and
binutils-20000722-1.

I must admint, I do not spend much time in Zsh under Cygwin, but almost all
regression tests passed (failed are related to unsupported features).
