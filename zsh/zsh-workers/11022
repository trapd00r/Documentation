Subject: History bug (Re: Completion debugging)
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Look at this snippet of "history" output:

   21  cd zsh-3.1.6
   22  setup_compinit
   24  emacs /tmp/zsh149find1 ;: find\ -
   24  history
   25  emacs /tmp/zsh149find1 ;: find\ -
   26  history
   28  emacs /tmp/zsh149find2 ;: find\ 
   29  emacs /tmp/zsh149echo3 ;: echo\ foo\ 
   29  history
   30  reload _complete_debug
   32  emacs /tmp/zsh149find4 ;: 'find -'
   32  history

Why are there two of numbers 24, 29 and 32?  In each case, the first of the
two was inserted by calling "print -s ..." during completion.  Apparently
that doesn't work very well.
