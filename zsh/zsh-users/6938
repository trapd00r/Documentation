} How hard would it be implementing a "noparse" precommand modifier?

What does "noparse" mean?  It's got to begin parsing before it can
recognize a precommand modifier.  Even splitting into words at whitespace
is parsing, of a sort.  

Do backslashes still work?  What about quotes of various flavors?  Care
to predict every possible question of this kind that I might ask?

If there isn't _some_ syntax, you're just using "cat" as your shell; the
input can't be processed in any useful way.

If you want to be able to define your own arbitrary syntax, you need a
language-definition language (like a YACC grammar).  How hard would it
be to implement that?
