Look at _man, you'll see things like:

  rep=( $manpath/(sman|man|cat)*/${~approx}$PREFIX${~star}$SUFFIX.*(:t) )

I.e., it does its matching/filtering itself, before the completion code
has a chance to use any match specs.

That's ugly.  But caching could be pretty costly.  Maybe we should make
it configurable, mentioning the problem with match specs?

Any other ideas, anyone?


Bye
  Sven
