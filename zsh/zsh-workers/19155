    Hi Bart :)

    Oh, I forgot the (%) flag and I stuck with the '-P' for
interpreting %0. BTW, how works exactly the %0(l..$RANDOM)
construction? I know that the (l..) is for padding with a random
number, and I suppose the %0 is there for avoiding printing it, but I
don't know how it exactly works... If you're tired of this feel free
to ignore me ;) For me, %0 can only be a job specification, because I
don't know about any prompt escape that fits just %NUMBER :?

    Yes, it will do. I just didn't know where should I do the
redirection (or if it was possible at all...). Thanks a lot for
showing :))
