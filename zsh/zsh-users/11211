"[[" was introduced by ksh, AFAIK.
And you are right, it's not SUSv3.
To check whether a variable contains only digits, how about this:

[snip]
if [ -n "${var}" ] && [ "${var}" = "${var%%[!0-9]*}" ] ; then
  echo "\$var holds a numeric value"
fi
[snap]

This should work in all shells that support SUSv3 syntax. It will
break in original bourne-type shells (like /bin/sh in opensolaris,
IIRC), because they do not understand ${var%%pattern} and the like.
