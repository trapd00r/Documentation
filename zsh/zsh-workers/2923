 Having problems with the build under hpux 10.20. seems to fail with
 lots of:

cc -Aa -D_HPUX_SOURCE -c -I..  -I.  -I.  -IModules -IZle -I./Zle
-DHAVE_CONFIG_H -O -o Zle/zle_bindings.o Zle/zle_bindings.c

cc:  "Zle/zle_bindings.c", line 36:  error 1588:  "acceptandhold"
undefined.
cc:  "Zle/zle_bindings.c", line 36:  error 1521:  Incorrect
initialization.  
cc:  "Zle/zle_bindings.c", line 37:  error 1588: 
"acceptandinfernexthistory" undef

 not sure what the problem is... I have tried both the standard
 '/usr/bin/cc' and the '/ansic/bin/cc' and both fail with the same
 problem. I am using the gnu sed as suggested... I am also having
 problems with gcc so it would not suprise me if you just said that
 hpux sux :-). 

 Any ideas?
