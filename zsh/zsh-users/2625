I must say I don't like the names and defaults.  The names give the
impression that chasing links is a very unusual feature while it's the
normal unix behavior.

But apart from that, I'm more often annoyed by `pwd' not checking the
value it returns:

	~/tmp-0% mkdir foo 
	~/tmp-0% cd foo
	tmp/foo-0% mv ../foo ../bar
	tmp/foo-0% pwd
	/home/monnier/tmp/foo
	tmp/foo-0% 

This is with 3.0.6,
