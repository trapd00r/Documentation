Hi folks,

I have begun yesterday my first own completion for the zsh for
xmms2[1]. It works so far, but isnt finished and I wanted you to ask
if there is something fundamental wrong or could be done better.

I have attached the file but it is also aviable on my webspace[2].

greetings and thanks

Tim
