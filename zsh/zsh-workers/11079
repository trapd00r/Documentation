} I have no idea, if these are significant:

} *** Duplicate node found: Files

This is a new warning added in the latest texi2html, it seems.  There are
a number of chapters of the manual that contain sections with names also
used by similar nodes in other chapters.  These aren't real nodes, so it
doesn't come up for `info'.

There shouldn't be a problem with it for the HTML pages as none of the
generated hrefs use the actual section names anyway.
