It just occured to me that I didn't say that I would be in favor of
using the patch. I.e. to keep the things we have done to the `(@)'
stuff plus the patch. I consider the previous patches important,
because it allows one to distinguish arrays with one element from
strings and this last patch made things more consistent.
