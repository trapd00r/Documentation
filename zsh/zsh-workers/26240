Since the problem only occurs as soon as you hit enter, I don't see
the problem, that this workaround (yeah, let's call it that way) only
kicks in as soon as you hit enter.

If it detects the problem, it displays a warning below the prompt and
ignores the first enter completely. Nothing changes. So, at least for
me (and some other folks who I know use this, too) that's a lot less
annoying than the correction question.

Of course, a solution within zle would be way cleaner. I tried that,
before I wrote that accept-line wrapper back then. Obviously, I
failed - who would have guessed. :-)

Yeah, that could probably be done. I'll take a look at it as soon as I
can find the time. :)
