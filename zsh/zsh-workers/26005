Hi,

sorry to bother you again with a test failure bug. :)
One of the tests fails if the output is localized:

./C05debug.ztst: starting. 
 

*** /tmp/zsh.ztst.err.25513     Tue Nov  4 01:53:47 2008 
 

--- /tmp/zsh.ztst.terr.25513    Tue Nov  4 01:53:47 2008 
 

*************** 
 

*** 1 **** 
 

! ./zsh-trapreturn-bug2:5: no such file or directory: ./fdasfsdafd 
 

--- 1 ---- 
 

! ./zsh-trapreturn-bug2:5: datei oder Verzeichnis nicht gefunden: 
./fdasfsdafd 

Test ./C05debug.ztst failed: error output differs from expected as shown 
above for: 

   cat >zsh-trapreturn-bug2 <<-'HERE' 
 

         cmd='./fdasfsdafd' 
 

         [[ -x $cmd ]] && rm $cmd 
 

         set -o DEBUG_BEFORE_CMD 
 

         trap '[[ $? -ne 0 ]] && exit 0' DEBUG 
 

         $cmd  # invalid command 
 

         # Failure 
 

         exit 10 
 

         HERE 
 

   $ZTST_testdir/../Src/zsh -f ./zsh-trapreturn-bug2 
 

Was testing:  trapreturn handling bug is properly fixed 
 


Regards,
Bernd
