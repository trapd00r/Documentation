I noticed that this make macro appears to want to default to .sl on
HP-UX, but it's not working that way on 11.  There's also a comment
in code to the effect that HPUXDYNAMIC should be defined on HP-UX 10.
There seems no need for that on 11, as modules are building fine
without it.

I'd be happy to work out a patch to update this, unless you prefer
to leave as is.
