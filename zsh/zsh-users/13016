this doesn't seem to work for functions like

function v () { gvim $* &}

Also, how do you make this completion  apply only to particular
functions? in other words, I would like attempting to complete on
certain functions to trigger the ignore class you have  setup.

Otherwise, it works great!

Thanks again.
