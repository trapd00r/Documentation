Right.  As I said, this is as it should be.  That part of the code is
rewriting the file on exit, so it should never honor the incremental
options at that point -- it must always rewrite the file from scratch.

One new option that I just remembered is HIST_SAVE_BY_COPY:  if you
unset that, the error will go away.  It is a little less safe of an
update, but it does allow root to update the user's file without
changing its ownership.  The alternative is to just live with the
occasional history-file warning while using a history-appending option
(I tested that that will still leave root's commands in the file).
