It's in my zshall, and more narrowly, in zshoptions.

For the functionality of "pausing" a command line, you can also bind the
push-line widget (check out the zshzle man page for key binding and
line-editing options) to temporarily interrupt a command so as to
execute another, and have the interrupted command return for editing
automatically.  I bind this to Alt-Q (or Escape-Q):

   bindkey "^[Q" push-line

And I have this custom widget to help me store a command line in history
without executing it:

   commit-to-history() {
      print -s ${(z)BUFFER}
      zle send-break
   }
   zle -N commit-to-history
   bindkey "^X^H" commit-to-history

So, I type a command, hit Ctrl-X Ctrl-H, and then retrieve my command
from history when I need it.
