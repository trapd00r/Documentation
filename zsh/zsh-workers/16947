Both, presumably, although I haven't explicitly followed through the
standard.  (It's kind of irrelevant, since you (akim) are explicitly
trying to work around eccentricities.)

Not for me...

% zsh -f
% setopt shwordsplit
% set 'one word' 'two words'
% for arg in ${1+"$@"}; do echo $arg; done
one
word
two
words
% print $ZSH_VERSION
4.1.0-dev-4

Same in 4.0.  Possibly you tried it without shwordsplit --- remember
it's only set by default if you invoke zsh in sh-compatibility mode.

There's a story they're going to switch to bash, but it's difficult to
get information --- we've only ever heard second hand from someone who
knows someone etc. etc...
