I tried this and I found it's enough for me.  Of course, I agree that
it's quite inconsistent behaviour and it shouldn't be default.

So I want to insert following fragment at last in _main_complete.

if zstyle -b ":completion:..." &&
   [[ $compstate[old_list] != shown &&
      $compstate[nmatches] = 0 &&
      $compstate[alternate_nmatches] = 1 ]]; then
  compstate[insert]=''
  compstate[list]='list force'
fi

What's a proper context and a style?  I couldn't find them.
