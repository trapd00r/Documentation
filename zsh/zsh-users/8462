(You mean globbing pattern, not regular expression, right?)

Use ^pat, which excludes everything matching pat, or pat1~pat2, which
selects based on pat1, then excludes based on pat2.  These require
extendedglob.  For example,

setopt extendedglob
print -l ^*.o

You can also "setopt kshglob" and use the ksh forms that bash now
understands.  These tend to be clumsier.

See the list of "Glob Operators" in the zshexpn manual page.
