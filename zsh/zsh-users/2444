Subject: Diff file for 3.1.6-test-2 available
Date: Mon, 19 Jul 1999 12:00:44 +0200
From: Peter Stephenson <pws@ibmth.df.unipi.it>

I have uploaded to ftp.zsh.org the file
  ftp://ftp.zsh.org/pub/testing/zsh-3.1.6-test-1-test-2.diff.gz
which should propagate its way to your nearest mirror over the next day or
so.

-rw-r--r--  1 mason  zsh    59766 Jul 19 19:51 zsh-3.1.6-test-1-test-2.diff.gz
-rw-r--r--  1 mason  zsh  1251180 Jul 13 00:57 zsh-3.1.6-test-1.tar.gz

To apply this, you need the patch programme as well as the test-1
distribution.  Go to the top level zsh-3.1.6-test-1 directory and do
  gzip -dc /path/to/zsh-3.1.6-test-1-test-2.diff.gz | patch -p0
  touch stamp-h.in

The major differences since test-1 are
  - some missing documentation files and completion functions were restored
    (this is the bulk of the patch)
  - completion evolved some more; compset -q works better; the KEYS zle
    parameter is a user-visible change but shouldn't affect many people;
    compstate[normal_nmatches] appeared; some other functions were updated
  - the logic for cd changed:  it tests for non-existent directories
    with paths like `cd foo/..'; with CHASELINKS it tries harder to use
    the real physical path rather than one with links in it; an option
    CHASEDOTS appeared which forces a .. in a cd path to resolve links if
    CHASELINKS is not set; AUTOCD now handles e.g. `../foo' when the
    current directory is a link and the logical (rather than physical)
    parent has a subdirectory foo, if CHASELINKS is not set (this always
    worked with a proper cd).
  - a few other bug fixes:  nulls in glob patterns incorrectly matched null
    strings and caused mayhem later; a counting problem with HISTNOSTORE
    when there are other things (like precmd) using the history was fixed;
    strcoll() (finally) is not used in character ranges like [A-Z] as this
    had unpleasant side effects in some locales; workaround a gcc bug on
    Digital UNIX 4 with gcc 2.8.1; a small line number fix.

I have only received a couple of pieces of information for Etc/MACHINES.
Please let us (zsh-workers@sunsite.auc.dk) know if you compile zsh and your
system configuration (including OS version) is not mentioned there, or
there are limitations not mentioned there.

If no major problems turn up, I shall try to release 3.1.6 in a week's
time.  Two things I'd quite like done if possible are
  - a bug in freeing history structures which could potentially cause
    a crash
  - complist could be made to work better with dynamic loading systems
    that don't make symbols in other dynamic modules visible (this looks
    a bit more complex than I first thought because quite a lot of
    symbols are involved).  The only current workaround is to build zle
    into the base shell.
