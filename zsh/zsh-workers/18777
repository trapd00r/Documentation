I'm not sure that's quite the same issue... Before, we would have
returned a NULL in many cases where now we return a pointer to a dummy
eprog.  However, the caller of the function I patched is using NULL to
signal an error (see the `return NULL' just a couple of lines higher).
So it seems to me likely that this got changed incorrectly to flag `no
code present but no error' instead of `failed to load function, error'.

Please contradict if you think my logic is wrong.
