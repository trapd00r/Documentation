Having reread http://zsh.sunsite.dk/Doc/Release/zsh_14.html#SEC72 again,
I now see
that we have two contradicting statements about this. The first one is
exactly
like you said:

>=20
On the contrary, what I've found
> is this:
>=20
>     "Associative arrays _must_ be declared before assignment..."

The second information, further down this section, says:

"To create an empty array (including associative arrays), use one of:=20
   set -A name=20
   name=3D()"

When I saw the "use one of", I was happy enough to not read the whole
section verbatim.
Hence, I had chosen the "name=3D()" form, believing that it would be
sufficient.=20

I now see that I has mistakingly believed that creation of an
associative array could
be done without declaring it.

It does, indeed. Thank you very much!
