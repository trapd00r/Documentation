OK. this clarifies the question. It would be nice to have this.
Perhaps for other things to (such as explain-on, which could display/speak
hints while typing).

I suspect that I have to wait with my other features till this
is a bit clarified because completion gets written to stdout,
and when I want to capture stdout, Ill come into a lot of garbage problems I think?

Another really nice to have(tm) feature would be stdout buffering.
What I mean is that the shell should have an array (much like history)
which contains the outputs (stdout and stderr separated)
from the last commands.
This would create alot of possibilities, including the one
of extracting parts of the output in a command.
something like
% ps aux
...
% kill `grep myprog <(print $stdout[1])|awk '{print $2;}'`
would be possible. I know this is an extreme example. But I am
convinced that this feature would find its uses.
Obviously speech support would benefit ALOT.

You got it. Thats what I want to do.

Hmm, you have to be a bit more specific. The topic is very large.
at least http://www.leb.net/blinux is the center of blind Linux users.
