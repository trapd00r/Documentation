Here's an alternative (and simpler) patch for making sure the TTY is
opened read/write:  as suggested by Zoltan, and I believe one other
poster, it opens /dev/tty if it can't get the tty attached to fd 0
r/w.  This is a simple change since it tried to open /dev/tty anyway
if fd 0 wasn't attached to a tty.  I've put in some extra code to make
sure SHTTY is -1 when init_io() is called if and only if there's no tty,
and to make sure there's no fd leak if init_io() is repeatedly called.

The result is that if you use a root-owned terminal and su to a zsh
user, the terminal will be /dev/tty rather than the actual device
name.  I could try harder to dup(0) and see if that's writeable first
if anybody really cares about the name, but this is the simplest
solution.
