The problems really start when we write tests for builtins, which we will
(`we' possibly being a euphemism in this case), and which could
proliferate.  There's no world digit shortage; we could just use
three-digit numbers along the lines of

0XX   shell syntax
1XX   builtins (i.e. builtin builtins)
2XX   zmodload and modules
3XX   zpty and interactive features

which means it's easy to remember where numbers for the group you're
writing tests in run out, and guarantees no more renumbering until zsh 8.0.
