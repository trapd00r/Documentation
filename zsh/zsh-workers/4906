Hi - 

I recently downloaded and compiled zsh-3.1.5-pws-4. However, I found a
couple of memory leaks in builtin.c where the result of a ztrdup was
being used as an argument, and not freed, and also where the result of a
"promptexpand" was being passed to "unmetafy," and then that result was
never freed.

After fixing the problem and re-compiling, I have been using the
resulting executable for two days now, and have seen no problems.

Is there any kind of test suite to use before submitting a patch? or
should I just go ahead and send it?


Thanks - 

Dan
