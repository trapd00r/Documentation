Hi,

I've used zsh for quite a while, and I'm starting to get in to some
heavier scripting and customizations.

What I'm trying to do is this:

I use pine to check email when I'm not at my home computer.  I often
suspend it, and then forget that its suspended and start anohter one -
pine has an annoying locking feature that causes both copies of pine to go
in to read-only mode, and lock up for a good 20 seconds.  What I want is a
script or function that does this:

if [[pine is already running]]; then
	fg %?pine
else
	pine $*
fi

its the "is pine already running" part I can't figure out.  

Thanks for any help...

Scott
