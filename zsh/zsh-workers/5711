I have /archive/pub/unix/sudo/ with cu-sudo* files in it. I forgot, that
they are prefixed with cu- and did

gzcat /a/p/u/s/s<TAB>

with the nice result

gzcat //a

Plain old multicomp just beeps and leaves the string as is. Now, it is
_really_ hard to decide what to do ... Should it complete as far as
possible? Or, if nothing matches, leave command line as is? Again, the
problem is, zsh cannot read your mind and decide, where was the error.

cheers
