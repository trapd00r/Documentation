For nonblocking reads?  That was in the patch for the [[ bug bug ]] bug
that caused BUG: wrong character in hungetc().  That's because the patch
was made for 3.1.2 but it also applies to 3.0.4.  Just remove the static
keyword in parse.c from discard input.  Alternatively remove the /**/
mark before the function, and either move the function to the top of the
file, or put a forward declaration to the beginning.  But the warning is
really harmless, and the best and most convinient solution is to just
ignore it.
