} I wonder if it's worth adding an option to emulate so you can "emulate

} with anything else.

I just noticed this, and although it's a pleasant-sounding idea I don't
think we want to proceed in that direction.  Before you know it someone
will want to be able to say "emulate -v 2.6" to get back the different
handling of literal/lexical history, and similar lunacy.
