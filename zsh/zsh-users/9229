Hi,

 I played around with combinations including expressions like
 **/*(.,oL) trying to get a listing of all files found !including
 those of the subdirectories! sorted by their size. I want one big
 listing sorted "once" -- but I got "seperated" parts sorted each for
 themselves. 

 I would understand this, if I had submitted something like:

   print -l **/*(oL) 

 which includes directories due to the missing ".", but when I submit:

   print -l **/*(.,oL)

 I would expect "all files sorted by their size".

 But as always, the problem is probably caused by the person sitting
 right in front of my monitor, I fear ;)

 Is there a way to get one big listing starting with the smallest file
 of all files found (including those in the subdirectories) and ending
 with the largest one? ...without the conventional way of slowly
 smokeing a sort-pipe ?

 Thanks a lot in advance for any help or hint ! :O)

 Keep zshing!
 Meino
