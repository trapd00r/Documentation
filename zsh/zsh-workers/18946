Subject: perforce completion problems: doesn't use supplied p4 flags
To: zw <zsh-workers@sunsite.dk>
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

The p4 completer doesn't seem to use the p4 flags provided to do completion.

For example if I do a:  "p4 -p perforce_host2:1666 client <TAB>"
It doesn't make use of the -p flag when trying to do completions for possible
clients.  It uses the default.  There are other flags that should also be
carried along when generating completions for some items like user/password.

Also the completer doesn't complete the "p4 -Ztag"  flag.

-FR.
