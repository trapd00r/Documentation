I didn't have any strong opinions about the things in those messages
or, for 1973, am not the person who can decide that (but Geoff sent a
reply).

As for my todo-list: only bug-fixing, the file-patterns stuff Peter
has just `suggested' (or complained about if you prefer) and the
function-moving-around which will happen before the final release, I
think. Oh, and removing compconf().
