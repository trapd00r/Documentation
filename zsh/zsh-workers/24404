Hi,

I'm running zsh in an UTF‐8 environment. Today I wanted to know what this
“f﻿” character is and found that zsh can't handle it.

% unicode -s f﻿
U+0066 LATIN SMALL LETTER F
UTF-8: 66  UTF-16BE: 0066  Decimal: &#102;
f (F)
Uppercase: U+0046
Category: Ll (Letter, Lowercase)
Bidi: L (Left-to-Right)

U+FEFF ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE
UTF-8: ef bb bf  UTF-16BE: feff  Decimal: &#65279;
﻿
Category: Cf (Other, Format)
Bidi: BN (Boundary Neutral)

The problem seems to be the zero with character. This explains why I can
go back before the U of “unicode.”

I'm using zsh-beta (4.3.4-dev-7) from Debian.

Bye, Jörg.
