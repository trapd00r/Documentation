Right, I don't think anyone is going to complain about your
implementation being too complete. :)

However, you'll see many of the completion functions tend to adopt the
first (and a half) approach E.g. "(- *)--version" without specifying
--version in any of the other option's exclusion lists because for
many commands --version simply overrides the other options rather than
producing an error.
