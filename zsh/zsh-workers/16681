I think that each of the following should either be put into Etc/BUGS or
the documentation.  Any comments?

    * Unrandom $RANDOM in subshells
    * time and repeat builtins don't mix
    * certain prompt expansions are elided if LINES<3
    * Zsh should clean up its signals on startup
    * zsh does not know how to handle multibyte characters
