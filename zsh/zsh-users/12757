I like to use narrow-to-region for this. It was a bit hard to use so
i made a wrapper function for it.

zle -N _narrow_to_region_marked
bindkey "^X^I"    _narrow_to_region_marked
autoload -U narrow-to-region
function _narrow_to_region_marked()
{
  local right
  local left
  if ((MARK == 0)); then
    zle set-mark-command
  fi
  if ((MARK < CURSOR)); then
    left="$LBUFFER[0,$((MARK-CURSOR-1))]"
    right="$RBUFFER"
  else
    left="$LBUFFER"
    right="$BUFFER[$((MARK+1)),-1]"
  fi
  narrow-to-region -p "$left>>|" -P "|<<$right"
}

So you would ctrl-R search for command A, then type a | and press ^X^I
and then ctrl-R for command B and press enter, that will exit the
narrow-to-region mode and combine the two commandlines.
