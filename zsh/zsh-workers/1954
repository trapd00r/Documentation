The idea is really nice. Here is another one:

I often find itself in a position, where I use several command in a loop;
e.g. (simplified)

% vi
% cc
% ./a.out

or like. What about "HIST_IGNORE_ALL_DUPS" option, which would keep only
globally unique command line? It would be very easy to add this (now it
shold probably be combined with strip_spaces as well).

Any comments?
