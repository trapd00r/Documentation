Or maybe it's related to the fact that what is usually bound to M-<
and M->, namely {beginning,end}-of-buffer-or-history does exactly that
inside menu selection (move to the left-/right-most column).

{beginning,end}-of-history should have the meaning you want even
inside menu selection but are not usually bound.
