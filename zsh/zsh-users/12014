=================

i've got this (in colors, depending on battery state and level of charge) 
on FreeBSD 6.2 (acpi). if anyone wants details i'll post...

short version: root runs a cron job every minute to get the battery state; 
this is written to a file in /tmp; the prompt looks for this file; if it's 
there it becomes part of the prompt.
