   This chapter provides step-by-step instructions to install and turn on
   your terminal. Perform each step in order.

Unpacking

   Unpack and check the contents of each carton.

   If you have missing or damaged items, contact your sales representative
   and delivery agent.

   Place the terminal on a level surface.

   If you have the optional tilt-swivel base, install it now. The base
   comes with installation instructions. To order the base, see Appendix
   B.

Installation

   Install the keyboard's legend strip and standoffs.

   To install the legend strip, slide it under the tabs.

   Connect the keyboard to the video terminal.
    1. The keyboard cable is already connected to the keyboard and routed
       to the left. If you want the cable routed to the right, remove the
       cable from the short groove and press it into the long groove.
    2. Insert the other end of the cable into the connector on the right
       side of the terminal.

   Match the power cord to your wall outlet.

   Make sure the power switch is off (0). Then plug the power cord into
   the terminal and into the wall outlet.

   Turn on your terminal.
    1. Turn the power switch on (1).
    2. Listen for a bell tone from the keyboard. Then wait about 15
       seconds for a "VT320 OK" message to appear on the screen.

   NOTE: If you had problems, see "Operating Problems" in Chapter 7.

   Set the brightness and contrast controls.
    1. Set the brightness and contrast to maximum.
    2. Decrease the brightness until the background (raster) just
       disappears.
    3. Decrease the contrast to the desired intensity.

   Adjust the viewing angle.

   Grasp the terminal and raise the rear, until the screen is at the
   desired viewing angle.

Connectors

   Connect the system cable and printer cable (if used).

   You connect your system cable to one of the two communication ports on
   the rear of the terminal -- the 25-pin RS232 connector or the 6-pin
   DEC-423 connector. Check your system cable to see whether you have a
   25-pin plug or a 6-pin jack.

   Only one communication port is active at a time. By default, the 25-pin
   RS232 port is active.

   If you use a 25-pin system cable: Simply plug the cable in. Then go on
   to the next section, "Selecting the Correct Keyboard Language".

   If you use a 6-pin system cable: You must set the Host Port Selection
   feature in the Communications Set-Up screen to "DEC-423, Data Leads
   Only", as follows.

   NOTE: Chapter 4 shows each set-up screen.
    1. Press the Set-Up key to display the Set-Up Directory.
    2. Use the -> key to move the cursor to "Comm". Press the Enter key to
       display the Communications Set-Up screen.
    3. Use the arrow keys to move the cursor to "RS232, Data Leads Only".
       Press Enter to change the setting. Each time you press Enter, a new
       setting appears. Stop when the setting reads "DEC-423, Data Leads
       Only". If you go too far, keep pressing Enter until the setting is
       correct.
    4. Use the arrow keys to move the cursor to "To Directory". Press
       Enter to display the Set-Up Directory again.
    5. Move the cursor to "Save". Press Enter to save your new setting.
       Each time you turn on the terminal, the VT320 will use the
       "DEC-423, Data Leads Only" setting.
    6. Press Set-Up to leave set-up.

   After you connect the system cable, the terminal is ready for use with
   your host system. If your terminal fails to operate, see "Operating
   Problems" in Chapter 7.

Selecting the Correct Keyboard Language

   You must select the appropriate keyboard language from the Set-Up
   Directory screen, as follows.

   NOTE: Chapter 4 shows each set-up screen.
    1. Press the Set-Up key to display the Set-Up Directory.
    2. Use the arrow keys to move the cursor to "North American Keyboard".
    3. Press the Enter key to select the setting you want. Each time you
       press Enter, the setting changes. There are 15 possible settings.
    4. Move the cursor to "Save". Press the Enter key to save your new
       keyboard language setting. Each time you turn on the terminal, the
       VT320 will use your saved settings.
    5. Press Set-Up to leave set-up.

Selecting the Correct Baud Rate

   The VT320 is initially set to a baud rate of 9600. This setting works
   with most Digital systems. The baud rate setting must match the baud
   rate of your host system. If you need to change the setting, use the
   following steps.

   NOTE: Chapter 4 shows each set-up screen.
    1. Press the Set-Up key to display the Set-Up Directory.
    2. Use the -> key to move the cursor to "Comm". Press the Enter key to
       display the Communications Set-Up screen.
    3. Use the arrow keys to move the cursor to "Transmit = 9600". There
       are 10 possible settings, from 75 to 19,200 baud. Press Enter until
       the correct setting for your system appears.
    4. The receive speed is set to "Receive=Transmit". Do not change this
       feature, unless your system uses different transmit and receive
       speeds.
    5. Move the cursor to "To Directory". Press Enter to display the
       Set-Up Directory again.
    6. Move the cursor to "Save". Press Enter to save your new baud rate
       setting. Each time you turn the terminal on, the VT320 will use
       this setting.
