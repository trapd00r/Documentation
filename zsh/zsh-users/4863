Check your $fpath to see if it's possibly picking up other versions of
the function.

It's hard to see how this problem can occur in 4.0.4, unless there's
some additional option we should be setting for compatibility in the
list given by $_comp_options.  If it really is the function from 4.0.4,
try running `emulate zsh' before starting and using the new completion
system.  If it works after that, it would help if you send a list of
options you've got set.
