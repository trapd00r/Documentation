Hi -

In tcsh, when I put the following lines in my .tcshrc:

        bindkey -k up history-search-backward
        bindkey -k down history-search-forward

The effect is that when I type one or more characters and press 
up-arrow, tcsh attempts to match commands in my command history to the 
characters I have typed.

Is there a way to do this in zsh?

Do I need to write a completion function?

Thanks


Corwin
