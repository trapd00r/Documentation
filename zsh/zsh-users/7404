    It helps a lot, thanks :) As I told Wayne, I was doing a bad
reading of the manual, which clearly states that both symbols MUST BE
AT THE BEGINNING of the pattern...

    And this confused me the most, because I didn't know why the heck
zsh needed (#s) and (#e) having '#' and '%', which didn't need
extendedglob to be set. Now ALL makes sense. Thanks for the help :)

    I tried something similar (and completely wrong):

    counter=0; for number in {1..100}
    do
        print ${number/(*0*)/Hit a ten! ${match[1]:-$((counter++))}}
    done 

    Which obviously doesn't work neither, because the expansion takes
place no matter if a match occured or not. Your solution works
perfectly :) And I can use backrefs with it :))

    Thanks a lot, Bart :)
