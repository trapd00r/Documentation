   "Library linkage portability?" (Apr 29,  5:34am)

} What about the stranger platforms, AIX etc?

Search the zsh-workers archives for the years 1996-1998 for the terms
"dynamic;link" "dynamic;load" and "dynamic;library".  E.g.:

    http://tinyurl.com/3355m6

In particular start here:

    http://tinyurl.com/37gaqe

My recollection is that Cygwin and some other environments require not
that dynamic modules be linked from the main executable, but that they
be linked from another library, which is why the zsh/main module exists.
