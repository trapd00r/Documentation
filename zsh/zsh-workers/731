I'm not sure exactly what your patch did, but it didn't fix the bug I
had reported (at least, not the way I was experiencing it).

I find myself thinking along similar lines.  I've sent several bug
fixes that haven't got into the baseline yet.  And Zoltan's releases
have an enormous number.  I think the bugfix patches in Zoltan's
release, particularly in the lexer, need to be integrated as a matter
of urgency.
