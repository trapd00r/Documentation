} No. I want the form which result of expansion is original string.

Well, somebody offline just asked me about implementing "cat -v" entirely
within zsh, so I'm actually pretty happy with what Sven did.  Although I
begin to think that five q might be going a little overboard to add what
Tanaka wants as well.

Further, with extendedglob, the output of ${(qqqq)...} can't be "eval"d
without quoting it yet again, because ^ is a metacharacter.  So maybe
we should use a different letter -- perhaps ${(v)...} like cat? -- for
Sven's (qqqq).
