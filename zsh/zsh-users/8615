} Yeah, when I have a moment, I will write how I apply this command line
} "mailcap" to most things I do.

I think you did already:  zsh-users/6463 ?

} Huh?  the GBP is a var, how can a bare string be interpolated.
} [eric@pepper ~] $ "(15/GBP)+(3750/1900)"
} "GBP" is undefined

Um, what's the application "calc"?

When you said "my arithmatic on the command line" I assumed you were
using zsh's built-in arithmetic, in which bare strings are treated as
variable references.

E.g.,

schaefer[509] calc() { print $(( $* )) }
schaefer[510] GBP=1.44
schaefer[511] calc '(15/GBP)+(3750/1900)'
