It was fun writing it (and I needed something to distract me from real 
work).

Yes, to me (I wondered if I should point that out yesterday). But with 
the select[=val] in place this looked like a easy-to-understand
enhancement.

Another question is if it should mean `if there are less than <num>
matches, start menu completion', because menu completion (at least the 
*real* menu completion, not selection) works best with few matches.

That's easy to change, though (I'd like to get opinions from menu
completion users).

If one has `setopt menucomplete', setting the menu style to one of the 
`false' values can be used to turn menu completion off for some
contexts. Allowing `no=<num>' would either mean to turn it of if there 
are more or less than <num> matches, whatever we decide `yes=<num>'
means.

Hmhm, right.
