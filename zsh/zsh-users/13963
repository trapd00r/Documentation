See $'\r' instead of "`print '\r'`"

should be print -r, print without -r expands the \ sequences.

You should probably use IFS= read -r instead of read as well.

In which way does it not work?

run

rsync --progress /from /to | sed -n l

(or od -c)

to see what rsync actually outputs.

Also, in case rsync outputs it on stderr, try:

rsync --progress /from /to 2>&1 | sed -n l
