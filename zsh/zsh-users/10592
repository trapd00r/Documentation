I like the case labels to be less indented than the code that follows.
I personally put them at the same level as the case, and only include a
statement on the same line if all the labels are really short and the
commands a one-liner, so in the general case I'd separate them:

foo () {
    case $1 in
    (a)
        print alpha
        print second
        print third
        ;;
    (b)
        print beta
        ;;
    (*)
        print omega
        ;;
    esac
}

I also like a 4-character indent.  That's my preference...
