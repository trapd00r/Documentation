The umlauts disappear entirely > a zsh problem.

With NEXTSTEP you generally use other  (GUI standalone) terminal  
emulators than xterm which work correctly with NEXTSTEP'S character  
set. AFAIK there's no alternative to xterm if you want to use it  
with zsh.

Therefore, see my suggestion in my other mail to use NXIsPRint by  
default and still have a "printeightbit" option.

Let it put this way: zsh at least is able to deal with lower case  
umlauts. sh can't handle umlauts at all. Still, it's a problem of  
the specific shell program.

No matter what I do, capital umlauts always are ignored in zsh output.
