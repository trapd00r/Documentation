Hmm, I thought Functions/Complete/_main_complete was the main
completion function.  Where is it?

As far as restoring it, Do'h!  I thought I tested that, but obviously 
not.  Is there an easy way to bind a function to a different name and
restore it?  I've tried games with stuff like foo=$(functions TRAPZERR) 
... eval $foo, but that seems suboptimal.
