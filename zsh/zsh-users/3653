Subject: Test releases of zsh 4.0.1
Date: Thu, 08 Mar 2001 12:48:20 +0000
From: Peter Stephenson <pws@csr.com>

If you look in the development subdirectory of your favourite zsh archive
mirror, you will find pre-releases of zsh 4.0.1.  The latest is 4.0.1-pre-2.

The basic code is now likely to be stable, so if you are likely to upgrade
your installation but haven't been installing development releases this is
a good time to try it out and see if anything is missing.

Any information about installations on unusual configurations, and
preferably any fixes to go with it (or access to the system in question),
would be much appreciated.  Most of the information in Etc/MACHINES is now
out of date (not necessarily wrong, but not recently updated).  Most
flavours of Linux, Solaris, Digital UNIX and Cygwin get tested quite
frequently, but not necessarily anything else, so please send any reports
you have.

Thanks.
