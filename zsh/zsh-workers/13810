I think that's probably right.  In the case of MH, at the points where
folder names are needed you need either a + or @, almost certainly a + for
most people, and nothing else, so prefix-needed will just be infuriating
(well, I find it always is, but in this case it doesn't have any side
effect of working sometimes).  In other cases, in principle it might be
possible to complete something other than a mailbox if there is no prefix.
I don't think _mailboxes can decide all this easily.
