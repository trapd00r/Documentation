Are you perhaps reading the doc for Cygwin's /bin/echo?  The Zsh doc entry
for the echo builtin looks like this:

----------
echo [ -neE ] [ ARG ... ]
     Write each ARG on the standard output, with a space separating
     each one.  If the -n flag is not present, print a newline at the
     end.  echo recognizes the following escape sequences:

    \a
          bell character
    [...and so on for other escapes...]
    \UNNNNNNNN
          unicode character code in hexadecimal

     The -E flag, or the BSD_ECHO option, can be used to disable these
     escape sequences.  In the latter case, -e flag can be used to
     enable them.
