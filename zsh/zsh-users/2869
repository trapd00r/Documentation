yes, I do have a stty erase call in my .zshrc

if I don't specify -i, it doesn't find my functions... I get:

$ ssh hostname zsh -c function
slipcon's password:
zsh: command not found: function
$

this is because I load my functions in my .zshrc - they're all in a file
called zfunc, and I say:


# load functions (necessary for completions)
[[ -r $HOME/.zsh/zfunc ]] && source $HOME/.zsh/zfunc

in my zshrc.  (which is directly before I load in my completions, which
are in $HOME/.zsh/zcomp)

that worked, although maybe I'm not going about it the right way.  Any
more suggestions about my problem are welcome!  Thanks for your help.
