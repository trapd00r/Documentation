But zsh doesn't do what the user says and certainly
isn't doing what he wants. From a users perspective
an exec has two parts:
1. run a new command without forking
2. terminate the shell

Since zsh cannot complete the first part it should not try to
do the second. More generally if a composite action is composed
of several steps, each of which must be completed in order
for the composite to be completed, then an exception should
be generated if any step fails causing the complete action
to fail gracefully.
