I searched for "zsh" at gmane.org and found these 3 lists:

    http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.comp.shells.zsh.announce
    http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.comp.shells.zsh.devel
    http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.comp.shells.zsh.user

Also, if you go to www.zsh.org, the link to the official mailing lists
is down at the bottom of the page.  It goes here:

    http://www.zsh.org/mla/

BUG:  There appears to be a configuration problem on that page -- there
is no "2005" link, and all the postings from 2005 are being added to the
2004 page.
