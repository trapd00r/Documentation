I'm on a number of technical lists, and I've seen viruses hit lists
which you would definitely not expect them to hit (the mutt-users and
mutt-devel lists, for example).

Well not to be a jerk, but I don't really think that responding to
a confirmation message or subscribing to a mailing list is going to
deter someone who really wants help. It's never deterred me in the
past. Hell, I doubt someone would really mind moderating / manually
approving messages which are from non-subscribers.

A list which gets more spam / viruses than actual content IS likely to
make people who are able to help those that need it UNsubscribe.
Programmers and geeks tend to get a lot of email, and none of us need
more spam or viruses than we already get.
