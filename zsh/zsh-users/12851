I currently have ENDCODE in .dircolors set to \e[0m\e[0K, otherwise
linebroken files with a background color get the background color
printed all the way to the last column which isn't nice. This also
fixes the same issue in zsh completion listings. With menu-select
however, it causes all entries to the right of the selected ones to
disappear, since \e[0K means clear to end of line. The compromise I'm
using right now is to set the zstyle like this:
zstyle ':completion:*' list-colors ${(s.:.)${LS_COLORS}#ec=}
But it would be nice if linebroken files in completion listings didn't
print the background color all the way while menu-select still worked.
Any suggestions?
