Subject: RFE: DIR_PUSHD
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii" ; format="flowed"

AUTO_CD is nice, but I find it would usually be better if "executing" 
a directory would instead pushd to that directory.

The obvious name for such an option would be AUTO_PUSHD, but that 
name is already in use for something else.

The naming problem shouldn't stand in the way of this needed feature. 
Call it what you will. It will get used.

I propose
   DIR_PUSHD

You could also offer its analog,
   DIR_CD
and deprecate
   AUTO_CD
which is confusing in its nonparallelism with AUTO_PUSHD

Thanks

Dave
