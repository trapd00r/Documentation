Right, it's the same problem with generating the files for git
completion---if you're not using _path_files, you're starting from
scratch, and you don't have the useful stuff for handling directories,
hence you're doing too much work.

It would be really nice to have this all generic---pass in a directory
to a context-defined function, pass back a list of files, however
generated---even if it was in the first instance separate from
_path_files.  The combination of _path_files, compfiles, and the basic
completion system is as obfuscated as anything I know.

compctl was no better---but as the whole thing was hidden from you from
start to end it didn't matter.
