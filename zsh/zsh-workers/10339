SourceForge also causes problems for Internet Explorer because all the
cookies are for the "valinux.com" domain even though "sourceforge.net"
is the issuing server.  IE won't accept those cookies except on "low"
security setting.  One needs to choose Tools->Internet Options, select
the Security tab, click the Trusted Sites icon, then click the Sites...
button and add https://www.sourceforge.net ...

(I've got Win98 running under vmware on my linux box now.  Pretty cool.)
