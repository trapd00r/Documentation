Compare with:

% disable fg
% %1
zsh: command not found: fg

A bare job specification gets rewritten with fg, so can't be executed
if fg is disabled.  (()) math is similarly dependent on let.  I think
this is a bug, but it's not easy to fix.

As for why this rewriting is being applied after in, this is obviously
a separate bug.
