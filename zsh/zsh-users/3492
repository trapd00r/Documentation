Hi!

I am currently preparing a small course on "shells".
I intend to show the zsh, too, however I will start
off with the bash and only show them the zsh later.
Anyway - do you have any suggestions on what to show?
I'll append my current todo list below.

All suggestions welcome.  Updates will go on my page
http://www.math.fu-berlin.de/~guckes/shell/teaching.html

HOWTO Teach Shells
(bash and zsh)

Command line editing
Variables - exporting
PATH and order of dirs
PATH - do not include '.' (or make it the last entry)
Absolute vs relative paths
Quoting rules
Escaping meta characters
Aliases and functions
prefix/tab completion
command completion
job control
pipes
Basic shell scripting
Why not use the "csh"
mail check
