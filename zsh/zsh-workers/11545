Subject: configure script for zsh breaks for NetBSD /bin/sh, but not for NetBSD /bin/bash
Date: Tue, 23 May 2000 20:19:56 -0500
From: Chuck Hardin <chardin@fundsxpress.com>

The master configure script included in zsh v3.0.7 breaks on my NetBSD 1.4.1
box at line 1356 with the message:

./configure: 1356: Syntax error: word unexpected (expecting ")")

This is especially annoying because the case statement syntax looks perfectly
good.  It worked in bash.  There are differences between bash and sh, but as
I recall, the case statements are the same.
