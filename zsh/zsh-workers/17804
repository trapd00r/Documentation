Hi all,

Zsh documentation says that the complist module should be loaded in
order to get menu selection in tab completion, and that this module does not
autoload. So i added the line 'zmodload zsh/complist' in my zshrc, and the
module gets loaded, but completion doesn't work because compctl is not
autoloaded, only complete and complist. Although without loading complist
in the init scripts, the first time tab key is pressed compctl autoloads.

Shouldn't compctl be autoloaded, even loading complist first, or is
neccessary to add dependencies between modules?

thanks
