This may prove useful for ${.../...} case at least. More general use depends on
scope of these references. If e.g. the result of last pattern mathing is
available (much like in Perl) as, say, ``pattern'' array, than it may be even
more useful in case like

if [[ ... == ... ]]
    foo="$pattern[1]-$pattern[3]"

that would completely eliminate need of expr. (I am not sure, that there is easy
way in Zsh to extract matched subpattern currently)
