Oops, but it is still IMHO wrong. The list description is lost. Before
scrolling:

bor@itsrm2% gdiff --brief
Completing option
--brief                   -- output only whether files differ
.....

Note "Completing option"

and after moving to the last line and scrolling one line down:

bor@itsrm2% gdiff --new-group-format=
--brief                   -- output only whether files differ
.....

Was it intended this way?
