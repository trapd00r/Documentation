OK, we're all willing to relicense under the ZSH license. Emails from
Rob and Erik are attached.

I also had the thought that you could get the options and their
descriptions (but not the syntax) from "tla $command -h", negating the
need to include the help text in the completion itself. But I don't know
when I might have time to implement such a thing.

Thanks for your interest,

Jason McCarty

I'd be happy to:

I hearby offer my zsh tla completion work under the same license as zsh
itself, in addition to the GNU GPL, version 2 or later.
