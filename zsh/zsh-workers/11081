Sorry not to provide more details.  I was thinking the problem might be
closely related to the original patch.

I am able to get the same intermittent problem with "zsh -f".
myprompt@ zsh -f
host% mkdir j ; touch j/build.out{,1,2} ; cd j
host% bindkey -e; autoload -U compinit; compinit -D
host% zstyle ':completion:*:complete:*' matcher-list 'm:{a-zA-Z}={A-Za-z} 
r:|[.,_-]=* r:[^A-Z0-9]||[A-Z0-9]=* r:[A-Z0-9]||[^A-Z0-9]=* r:[^0-9]||[0-9]=*'
host% more bui<TAB>

If I try completing "bui", I rarely I get only "build" or  more often I get the
following sequence after hitting tab:
   bui --> build.out[] --> build[.]out --> build.out[] --> build.out1[]
         --> build.out2[]

Most times I get the correct behavior.  Though within several attempts I get
the
described incorrect behavior.
