Without more iformation (output) we can't tell you much about this.
But unless we introduced problems in the last couple of months, zsh
can be compiled on a LP64 architecture. In fact, most of my part of the
development from 3.0.x to 4.0 was done on a Dec Alpha (LP64, too, of
course, like every decent 64 Bit architecture).
