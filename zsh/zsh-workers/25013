Thank you. Yeah, my original question wasn't very clear I looked through the
man pages and the online guide, but I'll just buy the book and read through
it. I've also gone through the completion scripts provided by zsh developers
(but they're not very well commented so it's hard to figure out). Also, the
man page is really comprehensive and I've just skimmed through it looking
for key concepts. But I'm sure the book has a much better explanation and
I'll go out and buy it ASAP.

Thank you once again.
