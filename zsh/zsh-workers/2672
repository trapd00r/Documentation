Hi all -

I don't know if this has been pointed out before, but 3.1.0 is
exhibiting slightly anomalous behaviour in "getopts".  It seems that a
leading "+" sign is ignored for the last option in the list, if further
arguments follow - the following should demonstrate the problem...

vangogh % cat test.zsh
#!/usr/local/bin/zsh
# Test script to demonstrate "getopts"

while getopts ":abc" opt ; do
  echo "Option is : $opt"
done
shift ((--OPTIND))
echo Remaining arguments are : $@

vangogh % test.zsh +a
Option is : +a
Remaining arguments are :
vangogh % test.zsh +ab
Option is : +a
Option is : +b
Remaining arguments are :
vangogh % test.zsh +a +b      
Option is : +a
Option is : +b
Remaining arguments are :
vangogh % test.zsh +a hello
Option is : a
Remaining arguments are : hello
vangogh % test.zsh +ab hello
Option is : +a
Option is : b
Remaining arguments are : hello
vangogh % test.zsh +a +b hello
Option is : +a
Option is : b
Remaining arguments are : hello

Notice that the '+' is removed from the final option, when there are
following arguments...  I don't think that this is the correct
behaviour.

           Colm
