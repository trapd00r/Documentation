Just as a side-note: I don't know if syntaxes using braces in
programming languages is a newer concept then closing keywords, but
calling one 'stone-age' and the other 'modern' seems just wrong.

Not that my opinion matters much, but: zsh still is a bourne like
shell. And I don't blame its loop constructs to look like that. I even
appreciate it. Why make it look like Perl, C or Java? Readability?
I think not. I never used alternate forms of loops in anything more
than playing around, and I never felt like using zsh in an
unfashioned/obsolete way. Personally, I agree with Matt, the alternate
forms remind me of csh, which is a strong reason not to use them (for
me), and if it's just to avoid the bad taste in my mouth. :-)

Yet, I a happy zsh _does_ have these alternate forms, so people may
use them if they want to. Just calling the standard forms in ways as
if their use should be deprecated instead is wrong, IMHO. That fealing
also triggered this mail. :-)

Regards, Frank
