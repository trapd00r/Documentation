No, I was pretty sure there was a previous bug that occurred only when a
line displayed by zsh was exactly the width of the terminal.  It may have
been in a different part of the code, but I thought it was in completion
listings.  Maybe I'm hallucinating; I don't know what keywords to try to
search for it.  I may be thinking of the threads around zsh-workers/7053
and zsh-workers/7030.
