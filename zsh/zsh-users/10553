I have no idea what could be causing that and it doesn't happen on
anyway of the Cygwin versions I've tried.

Is it still the case that

>I am running the windows port of zsh (ver 3.0.5) supplied with unixkit-tiny.

?  I suspect there might be something wrong with this port.  (3.0.5 is
now rather old, but I still don't remember any problem of this kind
in any version I've seen.)

If you don't mind exploring other avenues, you can change

version() { sed -e 's/^	//' <<EndVersion
	TODO.TXT Manager
	Version 1.6.3

EndVersion
    exit 1
}

to

version() { sed -e 's/^	//' <<<"\
	TODO.TXT Manager
	Version 1.6.3

This ought to work, since it relies on basic shell parsing rather
than a special chunk of I/O.  Note, however, that it's non-standard.
