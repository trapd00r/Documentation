I have 4.0.2, running on Debian GNU/Linux unstable x86; sorry I
forgot to mention this.

This doesn't seem to do what I want.  Let's try again.  If, after
evaluating that, I say:

dir bar foo
echo foo
dir^Rfoo

I see:

[my-prompt] dir
failing bck-i-search: dirfoo_

whereas I expected it to find "dir bar foo" history entry.  That
is, your change seems to insert to the bck-i-search: -prompt, as if
I had written it, what I have on the command line at the moment I
invoke the search.  In order to do what I want, such insertion
would work only if a) the search would be regexp search and b) it
inserted "^<what I have on the command line>.*" instead of just
"<what I have on the command line>".

This is not a problem; I don't think I have any use for normal
history-incremental-search-* behaviour.
