Hi,

I didn't notice this before, but the `make install.html'' does not install the
zsh.html file. Texi2html generates from zsh.texi the top page zsh.html, and a
lot of zsh_*.html files. However, only the latter are installed. Since they all
have links like <a HREF="zsh.html#SEC_Top">Top</a> all these links do not work
unless the former is also installed. Therefore, Doc/Makefile should be changed
so that the loop `for file in zsh_*.html' should be replaced by `for file in
zsh*.html' (underscore omitted). Same comment refers to `make uninstall.html'

Best,

Zvi.
