Hi!

>     unsetopt EXTENDED_GLOB

Thanks! This works all ok here, too. For reference, my
ultimate path cleaning now contains:

# Clean up paths 
path=($^path(N))
manpath=($^manpath(N)) 
setopt EXTENDED_GLOB
path=(${${path//\/##/\/}%/})
manpath=(${${manpath//\/##/\/}%/})
unsetopt EXTENDED_GLOB  
typeset -U path manpath
