Could someone help him out?  I haven't looked at compctl for a while,
but I'm pretty sure it's better than tcsh now...  Thanks.

Hi,
I've been using zsh2.3.1 for quite sometime now.
I'm not aware of zsh having a sophisticated/generalized 
command line completion mechanism like "tcsh version 6.06.00 (1995-05-13).

The command, "complete" in tcsh is much more powerful and generalized than
the "compctl" command of zsh.
Tcsh's complete command allows much more specialized ways of completing
individual command-line arguments than zsh's "compctl".

If someone has already incorporated similar features into zsh, 
could you please let me know? If not, it would be a good feature to be
incorporated into zsh, as zsh is already very powerful, except for this
shortcoming.

If you are no longer in zsh development, Could you please forward 
this to someone who is continuing its development?

Thank you.
Enjoy!
- Sai.
