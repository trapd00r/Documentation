Hello.

I am trying to write a function that clears the screen every so many=20
seconds. I asked for some help in #zsh, and thanks to curalton and ft I=20
came up with:

precmd() {
	...
	TMOUT=3D60
}

TRAPALRM() {
	print "Clearing screen..."
	clear
	unset TMOUT
}

This works, but clear(1) is too obtrusive to be useful, as it will clear
anything that I've got on my command line.

So I would love to be able to call zle's clear-screen widget from the funct=
ion.

redondos@refinery ~ % zle clear-screen
zle: widgets can only be called when ZLE is active

I am not fully aware of how zle works, and how (if possible) I would make it
active. It looks like the zle builtin only accepts a widget if it is called
=66rom within another widget, and not on the command line.

Any workarounds for this, or any other way of clearing the screen more
efficient and unobtrusively?

Thanks in advance.
