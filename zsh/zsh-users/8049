The bug was fixed a different way, so you're looking at the wrong part of 
the code.

2004-09-08  Bart Schaefer  <schaefer@zsh.org>

	* 20325: Src/exec.c, Test/E01options.ztst: fix crash when using
	the "command" builtin (as opposed to the "command" precommand
	modifier) when POSIX_BUILTINS is set; (unposted) add test for that
	and also for EVAL_LINENO.
