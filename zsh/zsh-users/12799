(Your Face: header triggered our mail quarantine, so I'm having to reply a
different way.)

Does this work?  I only had a brief play.  The trick is that when you get
into /usr/ports/*/ you give it a specific pattern to match in a specific
directory.


local -a match mbegin mend

if [[ $PREFIX = (#b)(/usr/ports/[^/]#/)* ]]; then
  compset -p ${#match[1]}
  _path_files -W $match[1] -g '*/'
  return 1
else
  _directories
fi
