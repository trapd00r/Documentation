Both produce similar output (not to stdout but creating files on cwd). 
The commands itself are from "From Bash to Zsh" book

I get output from both but (see my answer to Bart) the output in the 
wrong case still contains some mis-processed(?) escape sequences.

Hm, I'd rather try to find out why the man output uses different escape 
sequences on both machines (see my answer to Bart). From what I see now, 
colcrt and "col -bx" (not sure what exactly these do - looks like some 
"get rid of the escape chars" stuff) expect the "Cygwin output" and not 
the Linux one (just using these names for the working and the non-
working case).

man on Cygwin is 1.6e and on Gentoo it's 1.6f. I have a 
/usr/share/misc/man.conf on Cygwin and /etc/man.conf on Linux. Both 
contain "Generated automatically from man.conf.in by the configure 
script."
