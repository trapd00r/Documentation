Installing zsh-4.2.5 on SOlaris 8 and 9, I had to add -liconv manualy to the
linkage:

--- Makefile.~20050406210938~ 2005-04-07 00:09:38.000000000 +0300

@@ -127,7 +127,7 @@
 DLLDFLAGS       = -G
 LIBLDFLAGS      =  -s

+LIBS            = -liconv -lsocket -ldl -lnsl -lcurses -lm  -lc
 DL_EXT          = so
 DLLD            = gcc
 EXPOPT          = 


I suppose this requires some fixing in the configuration process, since
solaris doesn't have the gnu glibc, and the solaris libc doesn't include
iconv.

Best,

Zvi.
