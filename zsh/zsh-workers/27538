<Applause> We have a winner. =A0I'm impressed :-)

This means we do need to make a change to the standard. =A0The tricky
part is going to be deciding exactly what to change.

Since it's a simple matter for application writers to use "$( ("
instead of "$((" when they are writing a command substitution
that starts with a subshell, I think it would be appropriate for
the standard to say that arithmetic expansion has precedence.
I.e. if $(( introduces a syntactically valid arithmetic expansion,
then an arithmetic expansion will be performed. =A0Otherwise if $((
introduces a syntactically valid command substitution, then a
command substitution will be performed. =A0If the syntax is valid
for neither, then it is unspecified what kind of syntax error the
shell reports. =A0(Or a modification of this which retains the
"single subshell" rule.)

This appears to match what current shells do. =A0All the shells I
tried Philip's example in output 256.
