no, no, thanks very much for your help, in fact it is my fault.

the error message was speaking about line n=B0 8, obviously i had a =20
look to this line and the lines above.

EXCEPT ONE : THE FIRST

my mistake was, instead of writing as shebang :

#!/usr/bin/env ruby -w

i wrote :

#/usr/bin/env ruby -w

not easy to see in a text file that the "!" is missing...

i had to do a ktrace to find that ;-)

i enjoy very much zsh anyway.

have a good week-end !

Yvon
