I am trying to load "zsh/deltochar" from both .zshrc and .zshenv, but 
the screen comes up with the following error message:

.zshrc:64: failed to load module: zsh/deltochar

The line 64 is:
line # 64: zmodload zsh/deltochar

Note that the previous line # 63 works fine
line # 63:  zmodload zsh/pcre

It maybe that zsh/zle is a prerequisite to loading zsh/deltochar and 
the automatic module loading of zsh/zle happens much latter in the game.

Regards,
 Darel Henman
