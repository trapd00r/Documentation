I didn't know _files in those days...

Hm. I cannot remember the purpose of it.

I guess that I wanted to complete a space after an argument.  Of
course, since it does not works as such behaviour, it should be fixed.

I think it should be replaced by 'compadd "$PREFIX"'.

Since cvs login and cvs logout does not take any argument, it may be
reduced to ':'.

However, I like completing files if there is no suitable completion.
