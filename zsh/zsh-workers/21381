This option still exists, though the --help output is not very clear
about it.

>From the wget-1.10/NEWS file:

** Options that previously unconditionally set or unset various flags
are now boolean options that can be invoked as either `--OPTION' or
`--no-OPTION'.  Options that required an argument "on" or "off" have
also been changed this way, but they still accept the old syntax for
backward compatibility.  For example, instead of `--glob=off' you can
write `--no-glob'.

Allowing `--no-OPTION' for every `--OPTION' and the other way around
is useful because it allows the user to override non-default behavior
specified via `.wgetrc'
