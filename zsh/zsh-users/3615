Hi there,

I' ve got 2 questions using zsh as shell-script interpreter. To track it
more easily, I'm splitting it in 2 different mails.

Running zsh version 3.1.6 included in SuSE Linux 7.0 I got some trouble
using "echo -e" in a variable:

$ echo -e "Hallo Heinrich"
Hallo Heinrich

is ok, but:

$ ECHO=3D"echo -e"
$ $ECHO "Hallo Heinrich"
zsh: command not found: echo -e

also with {} it brings the same:
$ ${ECHO} Hallo Heinrich
zsh: command not found: echo -e

How can I avoid this?

I've seen it working with ksh or bash.

Regards and thanks for the help

Heinrich G=F6tzger
