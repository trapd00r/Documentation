Did you intentionally omit or alter 7740?  That was Tanaka's patch to
handle gzip'd and SGML manual pages.  It looks like the change for

} 	* Bart: 7697: Src/subst.c: sroted -> sorted.

You must have applied that one by hand.

It should have been sroted --> stored, so now it needs sorted --> stored.

I'm not going to bother sending a patch this time ...
