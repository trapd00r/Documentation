I was going to mention that, but thought it would be obvious... we
need two things, a matching flag to use locale in character ranges and
case-insensitivity, and *separately* a globbing qualifier to use locale
when sorting the result of globbing.  Should probably have two separate
options for them too.  And if there's an option, then a matching flag
to turn *off* locale use also.
