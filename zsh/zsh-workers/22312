Hi, I use the following for case-insensitive completion:
    zstyle ':completion:*' matcher-list 'm:{a-z}={A-Z}'

It has always been MUCH slower than regular completion, esp on big
directories.  With 4.3.0-dev-5 it got even worse.  This is all on
a local disk (high bandwidth, low latency SATA), though of course
the effect is magnified over NFS.

Any plans to implement case-insensitive matching natively?
