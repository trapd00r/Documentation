Here's the patch I mentioned before.

I use to have access to purify, which does a great job at memory leak detection
and many other memory related problems.   I no longer have access to purify. 
Maybe someone who does could, run zsh through purify for with the tests.  I
would also use an instrumented version as I worked during the day.

Is there good freely available memory leak detection package that works on
linux?
