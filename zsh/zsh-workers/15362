However, I just went and checked out of the CVS repository version 3.1.9,
discovered it had the problem, and eventually narrowed it down to a change
between 3.1.6 and 3.1.7. The cvs copy of 3.1.6 works; 3.1.7 doesn't. Does
that suggest anything? I think I would be able to automate testing this and
write a script to do a binary search between two dates in the cvs
repository, except that the two versions seem to be on different branches in
many cases so a pure date search wouldn't be correct, and the branching is
different in different files so I can't just manually make a sequence of
dates and branches to try. Any suggestions as to something else on those
lines I might do?
