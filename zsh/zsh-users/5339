After setting the HIST_IGNORE_SPACE option, you can also define aliases
that represent commands that won't ever get stored in the history:
just define the alias expansion with a leading space.

For example, if you never want a "cd" command to appear in the history,
do this:

    setopt HIST_IGNORE_SPACE
    alias cd=' builtin cd'
