I used to use SVN for this purpose, though I have my home directory
mounted as NFS over a network. Recently I have switched to git. Here
is what I think can be done.
1) Create a remote directory. In this case, it is created in my /tmp
directory, or anywher. I just want to create a barebone repository.
2) Push everything to this repository.
3) upload this directory to your server

This will in effect create a remote repository. You have to do it only
once. Then add this http repository as remote. Now you can push and
pull all you want.

It probably needs webdav support. But I guess you have it already.
