In addition to !$<tab> you can use Alt-. (or ESC .) to recall the last argument. 
That saves a couple keystrokes, and it works in bash. IIRC !$<tab> doesn't 
expand in bash.

Unfortunately it's hard for me to remember this one. I'm already used to !$ and 
my fingers just do it. Plus if you don't have alt and ESC is far away on your 
keyboard then it can be quicker to !$<tab>.
