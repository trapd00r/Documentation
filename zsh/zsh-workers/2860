I think it would be a good idea to make history beginning-search bound to M-p
and M-n by default instead of history-search.  I personally never use
history-search, I always found it quite useless as history-beginning-* is much
better.

In fact, in tcsh M-p is bount to history-beginning instead of history search.

Any objections to change this default?
