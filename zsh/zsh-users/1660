As an example, ssh sets SSH_CLIENT='ip.you.are.from srcport localport',
which would be quite adequate for your uses.  As long as you're doing this
for customization, rather then security, it'd work quite nicely to parse
out the IP.

I'd guess that REMOTE_* are being set by some program you're using to
connect.  (Neither rsh, telnet, nor ssh seem to do so on BSDi, so I'm
not sure what you're using.)

I'd tend to hold the login daemon responsible.
