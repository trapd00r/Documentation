} [...] all I wanted was to be able to do something like
} hit 'c <return>' to clear the screen and have a filenames-only listing of

    function c() {
	echotc cl
	print -rc *(.)
    }

} 'control-'

There isn't any special syntax for that.  You just have to put the control
characters in as themselves.
