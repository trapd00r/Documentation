Subject: eval and resetting $? (Was Re: trap DEBUG + set -o DEBUG_BEFORE_CMD not setting $? nonzero in current CVS)

Thanks. This seems to work.

However when I use it I run into something else that looks like either
a bug or at least something whose behavior should be documented. In
the following program it feels like $? gets changed/reset? before eval
is run:

#!/usr/local/bin/zsh -f
cmd='print $?'
fdsafsdsfa # Invalid command
eval $cmd  # print $? works and so does
                  # ./file-containing: print $?

print $? works because $? is expanded before print is run. And
sourcing a file which contains the string I want to eval also works,
so this gives me a workaround for this problem.

But somehow I think that a string writing that to a file and sourcing
it should be equivalent to eval'ing the string.
