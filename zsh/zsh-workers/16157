Subject: "read -q" and TAB
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Does anyone remember why utils.c:getquery() interprets TAB as 'y'?  This
has been this way forever (or at least as far back as my own CVS records
go) and my only guess is that it has something to do with spckword().

This surely is broken for purposes of "read -q", and actively dangerous
for checkrmall()?
