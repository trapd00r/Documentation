I'm seeing a problem with running multiple vared  commands on the same
command line with the latest zsh from anonymous cvs.  Tested on both
FC1&3.

Example.  (added [] to show where the cursor is placed).  In this
example I just hit return for each of the vared lines.  It displays
spaces for some of the characters on the second vared, though it
doesn't seem to change the value of the variable
zsh -f
% var1=fhardy@boys.com var2=jhardy@boys.com
% vared var1 ; vared var2
fhardy@boys.com[]
j              []
% vared var2 ; vared var1
jhardy@boys.com[]
f              []
% exit

-FR.
