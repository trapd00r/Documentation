The way to fiddle with it is to use ^Xh to find the context where
you're completing.  For example,

% v ^Xh
tags in context :completion::complete:v::
    all-files  (_files _default)

Then adjust the pattern in zstyle so that it covers the style with the
tag, i.e. :completion::complete:v::all-files in this case.
