you might want to try messing around with your options; i really doubt that
the problem has anything to do with nfs - we use nfs to mount netapps and
other filesystems on almost all of our machines, and i've never had a problem
with completion.

you might try:
bash_auto_list
no_menu_complete
no_auto_menu

that's what i have.

are there a lot of files in the directory you're trying to look at?  i was
testing this out and it did take a while to get to:
zsh: do you wish to see all 266 possibilities (67 lines)? 

- so it might just be taking a while to figure out all the files / directory
names.  if you are using color ls or 'ls -F' or anything you might try
/bin/ls /hosts/other_machine/exported_directory/<TAB>
and see if that's any speedier.
