It's possible there's some kind of obscure bug here.

If I do:

LANG=3D zsh

(so that LANG=3D'' when the shell starts) then I can't input accented or
umlauted ISO-8859 characters *at all* -- they appear to be discarded
at the point where they'd go into the line editor buffer.  Prefixing
them with ctrl-v doesn't help.

If I override self-insert with

self-insert() { zle -M "$KEYS"; zle .self-insert }; zle -N self-insert

then I get the keystrokes in the message area as e.g. \M-| but still
nothing in the line editor buffer.

Changing the values of LANG and LC_* after the shell has started makes
no difference to this; once it's broken, it's broken for good.  Only by
exiting and restarting with a non-empty LANG can I get it working again.
Changing the multibyte and printeightbit options makes no difference.
