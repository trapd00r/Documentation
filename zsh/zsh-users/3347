Well, Potato is frozen state right now and it will go to stable state very
soon. No single package in stable Debian distribution is allowed to have so
called release critical bugs. And that means, that zsh provided with Potato
has no release critical bugs.

What about next version called Woody. It is in unstable state. It has
zsh 3.1.9.dev3-1. I could take it and install it in my Potato, but I am
chicken.  :-)

I'll delete that ~/.zlogin-file, when my zsh is upgraded during upgrading of
Debian.
