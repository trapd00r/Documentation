I use the vi editing mode.  In 2.5, I can use ^A and ^E (for beginning of
line/end of line).  However, this doesn't work in 3.0.  Even if I do:

bindkey '^A' beginning-of-line

-or-

bindkey '^A' vi-beginning-of-line


Actually, it does work 3.0, but in a less then desirable way.  If I do the
bindkey, ^A works in insert mode only, not in command mode (it was the other
way around in 2.5).
