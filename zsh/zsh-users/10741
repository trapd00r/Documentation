    Sure, that's basic common sense, and also the reason I agonized over
    the introduction sketch for a few days. I wanted to offer more than
    a "wtf?" when I was going to ask. So I kept reading, and got in a
    kind of loop: didn't understand, and wanted to offer more than a
    "wtf?"... etc.

    Really, as I'm reading the manual again and again looking up what I
    think /might/ be the right API, or just useful for what I want to
    do, I run into various bits of the introductory information hidden
    at different places. It's all there, only in a suboptimal form, so
    pulling it up should be quite doable.

    I'm looking forward to reading it when 4.3 comes out.

    I appreciate the hard work that's been put into both books.
    Documentation is hard.
