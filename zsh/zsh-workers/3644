I sent a patch for this some time ago, here is the old message:

Hi

Dunno if there was a patch for this before...

In 3.1.2 autoloaded functions are implemented by making them
(internally) functions which load themselves. For this there is a new
struct autofn and a corresponding description in utils.c.
This descriptions says that the struct has one extra integer that
should be copied in dupstruct2(). But in fact there is a pointer which
should be copied directly. Due to sizeof(int) != sizeof(Shfunc) on an
Alpha this doesn't copy the pointer, leaving it zero, causing a SEGV
later on.
The patch below is probably a bit simple (-minded), but it works.

Bye
 Sven

Zoltan, are you currently in the process of putting together a 3.1.3?
(Or am I the only one who hesitates to build patches due to a missing
definition of `official patches' or `patches that will go into the
next release'?)

Bye
 Sven
