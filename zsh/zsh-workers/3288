There's something wrong with the terminal init code in zsh-3.0.4.
If I use a custom terminfo directory (export TERMINFO=/home/wayne/etc)
so I can use a custom terminal name (export TERM=screen), zsh
fails to find this terminal when starting up (I run "zsh -f" and
the terminal is in dumb mode).  If I then re-export the TERM
name, it starts to work correctly.  This problem does not occur
if I use a terminal name that is in the global terminfo database.

I have been running zsh-3.0.2 up till now, so I don't know when
exactly this broke.
