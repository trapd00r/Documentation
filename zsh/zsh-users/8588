Is it possible to make the completion system treat '{' as a normal
character?  What I want is this:

  % touch {foo}
  % ls -l {
  <pressing TAB yields the following result>
  % ls -l \{foo\}

If it is easier to do it without escaping the {}s, that's okay too,
since these files never have commas in them, and thus the {}s need
not be escaped.

Thanks in advance for any help.
