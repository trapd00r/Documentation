make -v, then?

Oh, and make -p happily prints the same result, though, so not even
the need for aaaaa hack - just discovered that. That's GNU make only
AFAIK, but heck. At least, now a conditional can be made on whether
make is GNU or not: GNU make -p returns 0, other return non 0.

Yup, agreed. Unfortunately, awk scripts very quickly become yet more
unreadable than perl ones... BTW perl even comes standard with AIX
