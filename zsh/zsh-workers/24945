Anyone up for changing this in a future version?

    Note  that  this  mv  will not move files across devices.  Historical
    versions of mv, when actual renaming is impossible, fall back on copying
    and removing files; if this behaviour is desired, use cp and rm manually.
    This  may  change  in  a future version.
