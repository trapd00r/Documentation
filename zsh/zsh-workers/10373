The CVS repository at sourceforge.net has been prepared from a recent
(everything up to 10250, I believe) copy of Tanaka's repository, and
is now ready for use.  See http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=4068
for details on how to use it.  Developers with write-access are
recommended to login to the web interface, click on `Account
Maintenance', and then under `Shell Account Information' click on
`Edit Keys' to add an authorized ssh key so that you don't have to
enter a password every time you do a CVS commit.

It would be nice if the web pages (and maybe FAQ?) could be modified
to mention the availability of this resource.  Oliver, had any luck
with that problem yet?
