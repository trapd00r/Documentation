What do you mean exactly? If you used it in a *function* inside a .zshenv
and then changed FPATH inside the same function, then it should have
described effect.

I just tried with ~/.zshenv looking like

FPATH=foo:$FPATH
typeset -U FPATH

and fpath is not cleared (and never was).

Could you show your .zshrc?
