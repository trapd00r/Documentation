Amazingly, I think I may have fixed a bug in completion.

With the following (note long line which might get messed up in the post):

_testcomp() { compadd \
averylongbitoftextthatshouldcausethedisplaytowrapovertothenextlinewitheffectsthatremaintobeseen \
bach cach dach each fach gach hach
}
compdef _testcomp testcomp

and menu selection in effect, type "testcomp <TAB>".  The long line
should appear and be highlighted.  Now hit <TAB> again.  The display is
messed up: if you see what I see, everything is printed two lines too
low.

The following appears to fix it.  It moves the cursor back to get the
line calculation in singledraw() correct.
