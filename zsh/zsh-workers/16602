Sorry, I described a specific case and forgot to mention the more
general problems.  They are as follows.

1) In the case of mak/mawk/make, the user has no instances of 'mawk'
in his history, but he has recently typed 'make'.  The correction
algorithm is unaware of these details.

2) When one has CORRECT_ALL set, correction isn't nearly as intelligent
as completion.  I have things like
alias cp='nocorrect cp'
alias mkdir='nocorrect mkdir'
alias mv='nocorrect mv'

Rather than adding a slew of additional aliases, it would be nice if
correction were smart enough not to assume that arguments to, f.ex.,
ssh should match local files.

I imagine that would be slow, though quite useful to some.
