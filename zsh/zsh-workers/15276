Aha.  I leaped on this thinking it hadn't picked the longest match and was
therefore wrong.  You're saying that since it consistently searches
backwards using the *start* of the string, not the end, it is the longest
match from that point, and it won't be able to find a longer until the
start has moved back.

I already realised the change was incompatible with the way % worked, so
I'll back it out and instead think of something to upgrade the
documentation.  I'm just tackling this in the user guide, but tackling it
at 11 pm after working all day probably wasn't ideal.
