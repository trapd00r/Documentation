} Is it possible to sort lists numerically, so that foo-2.3.10 comes after
} foo-2.3.9?

I don't think so, but what happens if you `setopt numeric_glob_sort'?

} Ideally, this should apply to every part

What defines a "part"?  A match spec?  Which match spec, if there are
several?

The best way I can think of would be to have the function that generates
the matches put them into the correct ordering and then add them with
compadd -V, but that may mean re-inventing a whole lot of the completion
system ...
