Yes, I saw that thread, back in Feb: yodl for Mac OSX Intel?

Unfortunately, I'm not on Intel, I'm on PPC.

I see that Jun T suggested:

 From reading over the v2 manual, and comparing it to the Doc/Makefile, 
it seemed like yodl v2 was a different enough beast that it wouldn't 
handle the zsh sources -- can someone who is actually using v2 confirm? 
  Otherwise I'll just try it, and see if I can get it working.

Thanks for the extremely quick response,
