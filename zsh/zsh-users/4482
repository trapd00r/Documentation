Hi all,
I have been using zsh for quite some time now, and the completion system
is superb. There are some minor nits though:
"cvs add" should complete not only files that are not currently in cvs,
but also files that have been locally removed (but not yet committed).

I also want to implement a semantic for opening / editing files, that is
independent of the file type. That is, if I say "open
a.html" it should open my preferred browser, and if I say "edit a.html"
it could open my preferred editor. Is such a function
already implemented?

regards,
Harshad
