Hello,
	I have a small feature request for _chown.  Could this line:

elif [[ $OSTYPE = (solaris*|hpux*|*bsd*|linux*) ]]; then

get changed to this please?:

elif [[ $OSTYPE = (solaris*|hpux*|*bsd*|linux*|darwin*) ]]; then

I've been using this change without issue for a while on Mac OS 10.3 
and Mac OS 10.3 Server.  I'm happy to test on older versions (10.1 and 
10.2) as well if you like.  Thanks for all of your work.

-Ryan
