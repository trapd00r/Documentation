I had seen q in the modifier list @
http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/zsh_13.html#SEC45
and had tried that, but it still had the same problem with ${(q)*}, and
I don't see V and z in the modifier list, are they documented?
Additionally, where is the $* vs $1 documented, since I'm accustomed to
$*. Thx btw, it is working correctly now, I really appreciate it.
