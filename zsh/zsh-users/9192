Hi all,

 Philippe has found the problem ! TADA! :)

 As previuosly mentioned, I have to set extendedglob either in .zshenv
 or the script itsself. But this wasn't the "missing link...

 One has to add setopt globdots also, since my directories were 
 of the form .<dirname>

 Thanks you all for the help!
 Meino
