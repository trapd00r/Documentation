Hiya,

$ zsh -c '. -- --help'
zsh:.:1: no such file or directory: --
$ ARGV0=sh zsh -c '. -- --help'
zsh:.:1: no such file or directory: --

The handling of "--" is mandated by POSIX I beleive.

With ksh, pdksh, bash you have to use:

. -- "$1"

if you can't guarantee that "$1" won't start with a "-".

Unfortunately, that code doesn't work with zsh at the moment.
