Hi, I'm not on this list, yada yada.  You know the drill.  Anyways...

Another issue for you.  In zsh v.3.1.4, the 'files' module, (built for
Linux/x86, but not really relevant), the 'mv' command doesn't handle
moving across devices.

Src/Modules/files.c shows that the implementation of mv is handled as a
special case of ln.  Hrm...
