But this isn't the first thing, it's the fourth thing.  What "things" are
you counting?  I.e., it's the first <what?> after major-version four?

I'm completely with you on this new habit of "not really releasing" software
by announcing it with a version number of zero-point-something, but having
got to one-point-something I think it's perfectly reasonable to have that
something be zero.
