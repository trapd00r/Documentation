(Apologies in advance if this isn't useful feedback, I'm a Ruby noob.)

Maybe it makes sense, but it seems weird that the tests are conditioned 
on running Ruby scripts rather than looking at `ri --version`.

And how does this fare against different Ruby implementations?  Would 
JRuby 1.9.2 necessarily use the same 'ri' conventions as MRI Ruby 1.9.2?

And more generally, since it's looking in directories that would only 
contain Ruby documentation, would it hurt to include both .yaml and .ri 
for versions that support .ri?
