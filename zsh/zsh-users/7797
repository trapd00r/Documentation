On the other hand, if it came from perl, it might make sense to copy
perl more accurately. Perl handles things like (0xab..0xde) and
(aa..zz) and even (Ab1..De2) sanely. This makes it somewhat less like
braceccl. If you try things like {A..z} in the new bash, you'll see
that it is trying to be like braceccl. Just not very well given that it
limits the choice of start and end characters.
