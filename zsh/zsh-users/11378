I'm assuming you meant "for" not "while"?

The `cat results.txt` will expand into the contents of results.txt,
which will then typically be split apart on wordspace, just as tokens
are normally split in a shell.

You probably want something more like:

while read theline
do
    echo ${theline}
    echo "---------------"
done < results.txt

HTH,
