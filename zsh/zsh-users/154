Hi all!

I think that I've found some kind of bug, although it is pretty strange.
Ok, so here it is:

{fly}[2][~]$ 
^^^^^^^^^^^^
Here in prompt are hostname (till first .), screen number and path (with
%~).
Now you do:

{fly}[2][~]$ mkdir p1
{fly}[2][~]$ cd p1
{fly}[2][~/p1]$ 

Ok, after that if I go to next screen and do this:

{fly}[1][~]$ rm -r p1

So directory p1 is removed and if I try from prevoius screen this:

{fly}[2][~/p1]$ pwd
/home/users/l/ld/p1
{fly}[2][~/p1]$ cd .
{fly}[2][~/addressbook]$

Well, this is in fact a great fake because addressbook is a FILE in my home
directory !!! (First file).
But if you check this more carefully you will find that you are in fact in
root (/) directory!

{fly}[2][~/addressbook]$ pwd
/home/users/l/ld/addressbook         # Still fake, but
{fly}[2][~/addressbook]$ cd home
{fly}[2][/home]$

Here it is. But there is as always brighter side of this :-). Try to do this
i.e. in bash - it will almost crash instantly!

Regards, Bojan
