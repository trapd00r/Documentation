} P.S. Why does cvs diff not put the full path in the +++ line for newly
} added files?

Because there's a bug?  It didn't used to put the path in the +++ line
for _any_ files.  That's new since 1.10.somthing-more-than-2.

} And why doesn't patch understand `Index:' ?

"man patch":

        o If  there  is an Index: line in the leading garbage and
          if either the old and new names are both absent or  the
          POSIXLY_CORRECT  environment  variable  is  set,  patch
          takes the name in the Index: line.

This is new behavior since the FSF took over maintenance of patch, some
time ago.  Tanaka's got a patch for the patch source to add a command-
line option for --use-index.
