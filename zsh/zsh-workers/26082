My guess is that this is going to be another case of some setting that
you use that is going to need turning off in _comp_options, or the
like.  Yep, I can duplicate your error if I "setopt glob_complete".

} and after waiting maybe 15-20 seconds, it does give some set of
} completions that do and do not start with a *. It might simply be all
} words in my history.

It almost certainly is.  You've asked for globbing completion, so the
* is being interpreted as a pattern, and guess what it matches?

What's your HISTSIZE setting?

The completion is in fact scanning the $historywords array, which is
all words in your history, so the more enormous your history compared
to the amount of memory and processor speed you have, the more poorly
this completion is going to behave.
