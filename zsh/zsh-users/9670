If you're leaving a vim running, it won't get told about the new
environment values until its next invocation from the shell, so there
may not be anything we can do to prevent it from dying.

You said that bash does not exhibit this problem?  If it's not just pure
chance that prevented prior bash-related failures, you might want to
dump the full set of environment variables from bash-inside-screen and
zsh-inside-screen and look for differences -- perhaps if vim starts up
with some different environment info it behaves differently (that
doesn't seem likely, but it's a possibility)?
