Subject: old or new style completion?

i've got a verbose copy defined as an alias in my ~/.zshrc:
  alias cpv="rsync -phb --backup-dir=/tmp/rsync -e /dev/null --progress --"

this needs a completion function similar to cp (cpv file to 
file-or-directory). i'm just starting to get my hands dirty with writing 
my own completion functions and i'm curious...

a) if an alias or function defined in ~/.zshrc should the corresponding 
completion widget/function also be in ~/.zshrc?

b) is the old style (compctl) completion system best suited to define a 
completion, if it's defined in ~/.zshrc?

c) being considered an "old" style of completion, is compctl in any danger 
of being deprecated? or does it still compliment the "new" completion 
system?

thanks...
