Subject: ctrl-d doesn't remove rprompt
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8; format=flowed
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Content-Disposition: inline

I just noticed, with setopt transientrprompt, pressing
ctrl-d doesn't remove the old rprompt, assuming you have ignoreeof set.
steps to reproduce

zsh -f
RPS1=hello
setopt transientrprompt ignoreeof
press ctrl-d

I'm using 4.3.2-cvs.
