That's what I meant, yes.

Oh, I forgot about that.  At least make that Functions/Example rather
than Examples.  I wouldn't object to Function/* either, but I wasn't
thinking about directory renaming.  (A problem with directory renaming
in CVS is that you then forever afterward have to remember to use
"cvs update -P" to keep the empty directories out of your sandbox.)
