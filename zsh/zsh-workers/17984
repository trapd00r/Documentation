It seems that GNU nohup fails to work if one does the following from
zsh (assuming standard options)

nohup ./zshscript &
<Ctrl-D>
<Ctrl-D>

This happens both with and without Philippe Troin's patches, but does
not happen if either the login shell or the #! shell is not zsh.

Does anyone know what's going on here?
