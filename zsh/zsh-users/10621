Subject: scrollable list of completions

By defaut, if I type a[TAB], I get:

zsh: do you wish to see all 140 possibilities (47 lines)?

I can choose 'y', but all the completions are output, even if they
don't fit on the screen. I'd like to have a scrollable list of
completions. I can use:

zstyle ':completion:*' list-prompt ''

for that, but then, I no longer get the above question. How can I
have both?

TIA,
