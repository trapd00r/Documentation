Not sure if it simpler, but (all one line)

bor@itsrm2% echo
${${(f)"$(<foo)"}//(#b)[[:space:]]#([^[:space:]]##):[[:space:]](*)/--$match[
1] \"$match[2]\"}
--option1 "value 1" --option2 "value 2"

bor@itsrm2% cat foo
option1: value 1
option2: value 2

adjust spaces to taste (I do not know if value is separated by just one
space or starts with first non-space).

You need extended globbing turned on.
