Now, old functions are preserved between versions (even those, locally
modified). So, the only possible use for functions.old is when you install
patched release - but exactly in this case it does not work. functions.old is
cumulative, so there is no way to selectively revert only a single patch. Much
easier to do patch -R and reinstall :-)

I ask, because functions installation takes a long time - that is not actually
needed IMHO.
