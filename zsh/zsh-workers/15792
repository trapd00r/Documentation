It seems that we should now be using zsh.sunsite.dk for the web page url
(see the forwarded message below). I've updated the one reference to the
old url on the web pages and the following patch corrects the
documentation. I've left the FAQ and User guide updates to Peter.

Hi

Due to changes in the SunSITE.dk URL naming scheme for projects, your
project is now located at

  http://zsh.sunsite.dk/

instead of the previous location,

  http://sunsite.dk/zsh/

Redirection from the old URL is enabled.  Please correct any absolute
links which might have been broken by this.  You should use the new
URL whenever referring to your project in the future.  You might also
want to try to correct existing references to the correct URL.

If you have any questions regarding this, don't hestitate to ask
them.  The address as always is:  staff@sunsite.dk

/Esben
