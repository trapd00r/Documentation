Is it possible to make general file completion treat '{' as a normal
character?  What I want is this:

  % touch {foo}
  % ls -l {
  <presses tab and gets the below result>
  % ls -l \{foo\}

If it is easier to do it without escaping the {}s, that's okay too,
since these files never have commas in them, and thus the {}s need
not be escape.

Thanks in advance for any help.
