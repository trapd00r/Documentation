Hi, 

A couple of observations/questions with zsh-3.1 on a HP C160
running HP-UX 10.20.

I have the following two lines in my ~/.zshrc

  WATCH=notme
  WATCHFMT="%n has %a tty%l from %M at %@"

messages are turned on for my windows, but I never see any login
notifications.  This problem is new to 3.1 for me (I didn't find any
compile options regarding this, did I miss something?)
