Yes, but now it's only one key press. You can't (easily) script a
^p.

^r is realized with the functions you mention. Not having them
means not having ^r.

If you see the subtle differences, you know why there are
different versions. Just pick the one which you like best.

I would consider this useful, as well.

Unless you are Swiss (they are allowed, by law, to append "oder"
to every sentence ;), appending "lol", "heh" or similar is annoying
to most people.
You are, of course, entitled to your own style, but generally
speaking, I have found that seemingly little things like that can
make a difference.

Point in case, I almost did not send this reply due to the "heh".
It might seem petty, but at least I am being honest. _And_ I
took the time to explain it in depth.
