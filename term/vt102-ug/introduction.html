<H1 ID="S0">Introduction</H1>
<H2 ID="S0.1">Product Introduction</H2>
<P>The VT102 video terminal is an input and output device of a computer.
The terminal uses a keyboard and video screen to communicate with a
computer.</P>
<P>As an input device, the terminal transmits keyboard entries to the computer.</P>
<P>As an output device, the terminal displays characters received from the
computer on the screen (using advanced video features) or prints them
on an optional printer. The optional printer connects to a serial printer interface
included with the terminal. The printer provides printed copy without
the need for a separate communication line and interface to the computer.</P>
<H2 ID="S0.2">How To Use This Manual</H2>
<P>This user guide describes general operating information, interface information,
control function descriptions, and specific installation and checkout
procedures. The main audiences for this guide are the operator, application
programmer, and terminal installer. However, the operator should
use this guide only as a reference when operating the terminal. The
primary reference for the operator is the document that describes how to
use the application software. The application software (program) determines
how the computer and terminal operate.</P>
<P>The information in this user guide is divided by function. This allows you to
reference a specific chapter when you want to perform a given function.
Chapters are arranged by frequency of use. For example, operating information
is frequently used, so it appears in <A HREF="chapter1.html">Chapter 1</A>; however, installation
is usually performed only once, so it appears in <A HREF="chapter7.html">Chapter 7</A>.</P>
<P><A HREF="chapter1.html">Chapter 1</A> provides a general description of terminal controls and indicators.
It also describes general operating procedures. Detailed operating
procedures depend on the computer and software.</P>
<P><A HREF="chapter2.html">Chapter 2</A> describes how to print with the optional serial printer. It also
describes the keyboard procedures that select printing operations.</P>
<P><A HREF="chapter3.html">Chapter 3</A> describes each SET-UP feature in detail and how to select
each feature. Many SET-UP features change the way the terminal
communicates with the computer. <A HREF="chapter6.html">Chapter 6</A> provides detailed information on
communication and related SET-UP features.</P>
<P><A HREF="chapter4.html">Chapter 4</A> shows the characters transmitted by each terminal key.</P>
<P><A HREF="chapter5.html">Chapter 5</A> describes how the terminal processes received characters. It
also describes the use of control functions. Control functions control the
display, processing, and transmission, of characters received by the terminal.
The application programmer uses this chapter when creating applications
software for the terminal.</P>
<P><A HREF="chapter6.html">Chapter 6</A> describes how the terminal communicates with the computer
and printer. It includes descriptions of the communication features.</P>
<P><A HREF="chapter7.html">Chapter 7</A> describes unpacking and installation procedures, including environmental
conditions to consider before installation. The chapter also
describes step-by-step procedures to turn on (power up) and check out
(verify the proper operation of) the terminal.</P>
<P><A HREF="chapter8.html">Chapter 8</A> describes the 20&nbsp;mA current loop interface option, including installation
and checkout procedures.</P>
<P><A HREF="chapter9.html">Chapter 9</A> describes all maintenance and troubleshooting procedures to
use before requesting service. The troubleshooting information covers the
terminal's self-tests.</P>
<P><A HREF="chapter10.html">Chapter 10</A> lists each accessory and supply, including part number and
ordering information.</P>
<P><A HREF="appendixa.html">Appendix A</A> provides VT102 specifications.</P>
<P><A HREF="appendixb.html">Appendix B</A> summarizes the SET-UP feature displays.</P>
<P><A HREF="appendixc.html">Appendix C</A> summarizes the character codes and control functions used
to program the terminal.</P>
<P><A HREF="appendixd.html">Appendix D</A> describes the ANSI code extension techniques used to create
escape and control sequences.</P>
<P><A HREF="appendixe.html">Appendix E</A> describes the differences between the VT102 and VT100 terminals.</P>
<P><STRONG>Warnings, Cautions, and Notes</STRONG><BR>
Warnings, cautions, and notes have specific meanings in this user guide.
Warnings contain information to prevent personal injury. Cautions contain
information to prevent damage to the terminal. Notes contain important
general information.</P>
