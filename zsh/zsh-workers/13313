..do the following:

1. i want root to be the owner of users's history file.
2. everytime the user exits the system, i want his history file to be
mailed to whatever e-mail address specified. how do i execute a command 
upon exiting? i always use TRAPEXIT, however, i can't make zsh to
read/write with root permissions.

thanks for your help!
