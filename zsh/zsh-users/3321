Completions for perl are not missing.  Have you tried a recent
development release?

I might get round to doing screen and emacs soon.  I'm not a vim user
so I won't do that.  ls ... well, that's a different issue.  The
options for ls vary massively over the different systems, so we
probably will need to have a restructuring of the Completion subtree
before this gets completion code.

Don't underestimate us :-)   We have a completion set which is pretty
impressive complete already ...
