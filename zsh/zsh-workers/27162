I didn't miss anything: the shell can still restore the previous
status before an exec.

According to my tests, bash *does* implement WCE. See below.

Is there any reason?

Well, after re-reading, I agree Cracauer's advice is wrong here.
But it is fixable and I think that the other parts of his page are
correct. At least, IUE/WUE/WCE are defined under the context "There
are several ways to handle abortion of shell scripts when SIGINT is
received while a foreground child runs", so it is clear that the shell
*must* receive a SIGINT (this is also said near the beginning of the
page).
