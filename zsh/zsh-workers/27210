0 225 Z% mkdir -p foo1/bar foo2/bar
0 226 Z% diff -r {foo*

If I hit tab, it would be cool if I would get

0 226 Z% diff -r {foo1,foo2}/

Then if I hit tab again, I it would be cool to get

0 226 Z% diff -r {foo1,foo2}/bar/

Then if I hit tab again, I should get

0 226 Z% diff -r foo1/bar/ foo2/bar/


This is not the current behavior.

0 226 Z% diff -r {foo*

gets nothing, and

0 226 Z% diff -r {foo1,foo2}/

gets

0 226 Z% diff -r foo1/ foo2/
