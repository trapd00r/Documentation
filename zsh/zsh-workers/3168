Dear all,

I have succeed to setup s restricted shell by zsh-3.1.1, however, this is
TOO restricted, it does not only prevent users to execute programs which
are not allowed, but it also prevents users not to change to other
directories which I don't want this to be happened.

I want to prevent users from running their own programs, but I want to
allow users to change to other directories, what can I do? Do I need to
modify the source code? If so, how to do that?

Regards,
Simon
