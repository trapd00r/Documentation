Subject: learning to write/use completion widgets?
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Content-Disposition: inline
X-Virus-Scanned: ClamAV using ClamSMTP

is there some *simple* documentation out there on customizing the
completion system? for instance, i would like to be able to complete a
particular argument of certain shell functions from existing
parameters. returning all parameters from a function is trivial (and
in fact my guess is that it's built in somewhere), but tying this to
the context "first argument of functions foo, bar, and baz" is where i
get completely lost when trying to work my way through man zshcompwid,
chapters 17-19 of the manual, etc.

any help anyone can give would be much appreciated!
