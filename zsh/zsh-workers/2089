fvwm2 (unless it's changed since the last version I got) spawns
modules and communicates with them using pipes.  It works just fine
for fvwm, but I suspect it would have limited use in zsh.

Tcl7.5 is another example worth looking at: it does dynamic loading on
a few systems, and has autoconf support for it.
