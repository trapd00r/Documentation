Well, I have these reasons:

- Almost no experience with CVS.
- Enough other things to do.
- I'm lazy.

But I think noone would really object if you offer to put up an
(more or less) official CVS server. Although I think most people
around here hoped that it would be build at sunsite.auc.dk -- in fact
Karsten once offered us the space for a CVS server, if I remember
correctly. Since I don't know CVS, I don't know how difficult it would
be to move the server from your host to sunsite if that ever becomes
possible (not too hard, I guess?).

Anyway, my opinion in this case probably shouldn't count that much
considering that -- ahem -- I have fewer patches to apply than most of 
you. Ahem.


Bye
 Sven
