Are you sure that's not going through _expand?  If I remove _expand from
the list of completers, I don't get completions for things like *zshe*(D)
unless glob_complete is set.

They're not *necessarily* files, but they could be anything; and
if they are files, then globcomplete means exactly what it says,
complete based on full file glob expressions.

The extra work in this particular case is merging together glob
qualifiers passed down (e.g. "-/" becoming "*(-/)") with any that are
there on the command line.  This is a rather specialised thing to do,
but you could e.g. complete "cd *(D)" and get files with dots.  (It only
applies with glob_complete because otherwise what's on the command line
is a plain string and you can just use "*(-/)" as the pattern.)
This does appear to work.  (In fact it appears to work even after the fix I
was going to propose for your original problem, which is encouraging.)
