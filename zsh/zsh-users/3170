Subject: zsh on HPUX 11.00

I have problems running zsh 3.1.9 on our HPUX 11.00 system.
Compilation ends without errors(!), but running zsh
yields the message 
"can't find termcap info for xterm"

I compiled zsh with "gcc version 2.95.2 19991024 (release)"

How can I get started in figuring out what's going wrong here?
How can I validate that the termcap resp. terminfo system
on our system is working?


Thanks for your help!

Johannes
