The problem with timeouts on Solaris 8 (which is rather antiquated anyway)
was they didn't get turned off.  This fixes it, but it's a bit nasty, and
also it may mess up the settings in other windows, since the timeout is
supposed to be window-specific, so I'd rather not have to do it unless it's
absolutely necessary.  In particularly it would be nice to test, so I'll
leave it out for a while.

It's really time I did something else.

Spending a lot of time on Solaris 8 does seem like a low return effort, but
lot's of people still use it.
