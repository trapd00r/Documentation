The difference in syntax is historical.  The BRACE_CCL form came earlier,
out of zsh prehistory.  I wanted to add a numeric form that didn't depend
on BRACE_CCL and borrowed the syntax for that from Perl since it didn't
look like an expression you'd have by accident.

It simply means a [...] pattern expression.  This bit isn't very helpful.

I note multibyte characters aren't handled.  That probably isn't much of an
issue for X-Y but you might want to be able to use individual ones.  That
looks like it would be a little work.

 Note that brace expansion is not part of filename generation (globbing); an
 expression such as tt(*/{foo,bar}) is split into two separate words
