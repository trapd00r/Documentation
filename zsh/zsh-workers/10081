Ah, so I was right after all.

That's exactly what I'd tried, with once difference; as I mentioned, I
want this behaviour everywhere, not just for tar, so I'd tried:

zstyle ':completion::complete:*' \
  tag-order 'globbed-files directories' all-files

However, neither your version nor mine seem to work.  Maybe I'm just
missing a bugfix because I'm behind on patches.
