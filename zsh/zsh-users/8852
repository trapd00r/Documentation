No, it's not enough.  "Doesn't work" is not an adequate description.

One last time, and then I'm giving up on you:  Describe, in as much
detail as possible, what happens (or does not) to you when you are
using the shell interactively.  Provide an example, such as:

  I have a directory containing these seven files:
    (... list them ...)

  When I type ls followed by a space and then press TAB, zsh just beeps
  at me.  This happens even if I press TAB repeatedly.  I expected to 
  see a listing of the seven files.

Ideally, you will also have run the "complete-debug" widget by typing
control+x question-mark INSTEAD OF a TAB at some time when you are
having trouble with completion.  This widget writes a file with a long
trace of everything the completion system is doing.  If that file is
empty, or if you get some different kind of error when you press the two
keys control+x followed by a question mark (NOT control with question
mark), then tell us what that error is as well.
