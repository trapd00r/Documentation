On the whole, I suspect it's not worth it.  The shell is optimised for
moving around strings of a few dozen bytes or so.  To do it better, we'd
need some sort of a stack; that means an additional allocation.  That's
going to add to the complexity in the vast majority of cases just to
improve the occasional case where $_ is some huge string on entry to a
function.   I don't regard this as a bug, anyway, so I think we can
ignore it for now.
