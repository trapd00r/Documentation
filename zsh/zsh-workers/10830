This is a change I threatened a week or so ago and no-one replied.  It
removes the option forcing dvips to use 300 dpi.

I think I can see the point for this now: if you make the docs for general
distribution, it's bad to make the resolution too high or people can't
print it out on their 1983 Epson dot matrix.  But I think that's an issue
for whoever's doing that, and this shouldn't be forced on everyone creating
PostScript.  (I'll try and remember when I set up the 3.1.7 doc
distribution.)
