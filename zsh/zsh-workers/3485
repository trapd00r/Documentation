Looking through the changelogs I saw no message of changing behaviour of
the path vs PATH.  So presumably there some sort of bug that I'm over
looking.  Here is the behavior I see.

aludeman@mr2turbo%echo $path                                                  ~
/home/aludeman/bin /java/opt/mh-6.8.4/bin /usr/dist/pkgs/devpro,v4.2/5bin.sun4/bin /bin /sbin /usr/bin /usr/sbin /usr/ccs/bin /usr/dist/exe /usr/dist/local/exe /usr/dt/bin /usr/openwin/bin /java/etc /usr/multicast
aludeman@mr2turbo%echo $PATH                                                  ~
/java/opt/mh-6.8.4/bin:/usr/dist/pkgs/devpro,v4.2/5bin.sun4/bin

There are treated as separate variables.

I'm using the sun compiler v4.2.  If further details are needed I can
debug it further.
