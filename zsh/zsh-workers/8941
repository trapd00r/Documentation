This isn't exactly useful, because if you move the cursor over one of
those multi-matches, you'll of course see the difference -- because
then the match is inserted in the line.

The question is if we need to display the differences in the list
itself. One reason I forgot to mention why I didn't spend more time
trying to implement that is: this doesn't happen very often. You'll
probably find some examples for when it does happen with _path_files.
Indeed, I'm almost expecting some more `bug' reports for it from you
after this patch ;-)

That's why I didn't use Peter's suggestion of stuffing all those
matches in an extra group (we would have to use multiple extra
sub-groups, I think).

Bye
