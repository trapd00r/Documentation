You missed a 94 and a 92 which I've marked: the problem is again that the
sort order isn't quite as deterministic as one might hope.  It looks like
something funny happened to the characters in your original post; this may
or may not be related.  It's possible the problem is in case modification.
The desired answer is that (in the selected UTF-8 locale)

  print -oi H=CE=95H H=CE=94H H=CE=93H H=CE=92H H=CE=91H

outputs

  H=CE=91H H=CE=92H H=CE=93H H=CE=94H H=CE=95H

(the middle letters are all upper case Greek).  Does it work without the
-i?

The sort tests have always been arguably more trouble than their worth,
though I suppose it probably is worth spotlighting where the problems are.
