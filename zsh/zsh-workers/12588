That's why I gave the `fake' style such a generic name. Although that
probably wasn't so clever, because the value-formats may have to
differ for different types of completions to fake.

`fake' doesn't allow this yet (and the way it is used makes it hard
(and probably a bit ugly, code-wise) to implement it there). But of
course one can always do it with tag-labels and ignored-patterns.

Given that the faked completions depend on the contexts, the type of
completions and the user's preferences, I don't know how a function
could help here. Maybe we'll just have to use `fake' (or several
`fake-this-or-that' styles that replace `fake'), get some experience
with it and then find out if and how we can improve it. And if it's
needed.
