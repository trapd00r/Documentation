} Im a rather new user of zsh, so bair with me if this is 
} a well known "feature" :)

The well-known feature is that `path' (lower case) is an array and `PATH'
is a colon-separated list.  So when you did this:

} % path=/usr/bin/:/nonexisting/name

you told zsh there is only one directory named "/usr/bin/:/nonexisting/name"
where it should search for commands.

What you want is either

% PATH=/usr/bin/:/nonexisting/name

or

% path=( /usr/bin/ /nonexisting/name )

} Every other shell(sh,bash,tcsh) handles this without any error :(

That's because `path' doesn't have any special meaning to sh and bash
(so you didn't change the command search path at all in those shells)
and tcsh doesn't actually use the `path' variable to search for its
commands (it uses `PATH', which is merely copied from `path').
