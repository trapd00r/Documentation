Hi,

Often, I run commands like

find . -name 'hey' -print

and I get a list of files I'd like to apply various commands to.

Is there a way to use fc to edit the list generated by the find command
and then use the newly edited list as a command?

the only other way I can figure it is to send the find output to a file
and then source it after editing.

thanks.
