Sounds like you might need to put  <path-to>/zsh  into /etc/shells.

Generally speaking you will need to do your own setting of TERM to be
VT220.

The "linux" is probably your default entry in /etc/gettydefs.
If you have a REAL VT220, and the getty is "smart" the VT220 will
answerback, its terminal type... but don't hold your breath, that
technology never worked consistantly in multi-vendor setups.

Otherwise, you will have to play games with tset. (man tset).
