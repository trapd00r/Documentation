compconf() creates that *and* executes the settings in it (directly,
without dotting the file). If you want a separate file, you can source 
it directly, but I would be against making this mandatory (or even the 
default), because no other zsh stuff does that (as far as I know).

I'm not at all sure, what you mean... *When* do you get that error
message? And does you .zsh-style look like the above or like the
output of `compstyle -L'? And do you have a file matching *.h_style?
Or did you mean .*h-styles? That at least works fine for me...

Bye
 Sven
