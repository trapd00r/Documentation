I haven't added this myself, since it's going to be Sven that resolves any
changes.  It can be held over if necessary --- there's no point in sending
out tests in a distribution if they're going to produce failures we already
know about, which just creates (shudder) moral pressure.

3.1.7-pre-4 has been pushed back 1) because it takes hours to go through
all of compsys.yo 2) because of all the small but important fixes to things
like menu selection 3) because, unfortunately, I'm not going on holiday in
the near future.


By the way here's a minor fix and addition to the octalzeroes manual entry
which I can't be bothered to post separately.
