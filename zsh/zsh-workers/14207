Thank you.  What an idiot.  I discovered it ... in .zshrc, after going
back to my study of the new completion system, and finding a reference
to "compdef -P _gnu_generic '*'".  I'd been over that same line when
it read "compdef -P _use_lo '*'", and installed it....


Shared memory *is* used in the context of *.zwc files, is that not
correct?


Thanks,
