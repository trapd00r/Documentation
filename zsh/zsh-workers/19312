Subject: ZSH build/test is slightly broken on AIX
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii; format=flowed
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

ZSH build/test is slightly broken on AIX:

1) if built dynamic the following symbols have to
    be added to Src/zsh.export for zsh to link:

       zero_mnumber
       isident
       c, lastend, statusll, statusline
       tokfd

2) the following tests fail the same, whether
    zsh build static or dynamic

    A02alias, B02typeset

3) the following tests fail when zsh built static
    because zmodloads are done without checking to
    see if they're required:

    Y01completion, Y02compmatch, Y03arguments

4) the following tests hang forever:

    A04redirect

Let me know how to assist getting these fixed.

As always, zsh rocks!
