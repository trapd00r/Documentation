} Just got this... looks like the iconv changes for Cygwin caused other

I'd like to know what happens if it's compiled without pcre.  I was a bit
leery when I saw that "-L" option being inserted by pcre-config, and I
wonder if it's not a library ordering issue (e.g. -ldl should come before
-lpcre or some such).
