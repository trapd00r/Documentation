Fine, although I don't suppose anybody's actually going to do it...
The issue is actually checking the state of fds and fixing up the state
after the open; in several modules, including socket, we need to open fd's
in non-standard ways.  That's about two new functions already.
Wrapping the whole thing up is probably a lot of work.
