Subject: getopts behaviour on `-'
Date: Tue, 06 Aug 2002 12:50:03 +0100
Message-ID: <11491.1028634603@csr.com>
From: Peter Stephenson <pws@csr.com>

It seems a little strange that getopts doesn't treat a `-' argument the
same way as `--', which is what builtins do.  The manual page only
mentions `--', but then it doesn't actually say what happens with `-'
which slips through the gaps in the description.  What happens is that
the `-' is treated as a regular argument, it's not skipped as `--' is.
I think they should probably be treated the same, what does anyone else
think?

What about a `+' on its own?  I feel too cowardly to handle any of `+'
`++' or `+-' specially.
