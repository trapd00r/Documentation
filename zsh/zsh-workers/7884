} When I use backward-delete-word it appears to completely ignore the
} $WORDCHARS variable.

Wordchars are the non-alphanumeric characters that *ARE* considered to be
part of a word.  If you want it to stop at slashes, you have to reset the
value of WORDCHARS to *not* include a slash character.

Either that, or use vi-backward-kill-word instead of backward-kill-word.
