Hi,

I've read the manuals and googled and as far as I can see, zsh doesn't =
appear to support exported functions. Is this true? If not please ignore =
the rest of the mail :)

Also, going through some old discussions, it appears that some people =
feel that the feature itself is of dubious value. However, I find it a =
shortcoming in the following situations:

1. In my environment are weird and wonderful functions that do some =
useful stuff on a list of files, let's say coolfun()

I can't do a=20
$ find . -name '*.blah' | xargs coolfun # coolfun: No such file or =
directory

2. I can't invoke=20
:!coolfun %=20
from vim, my favourite editor.

Both shortcomings are somewhat rectified by arranging to have coolfun's =
definition in $HOME/.zshenv. However, this gets tedious (and possibly =
inefficient) when a large number of functions are involved. I tried =
doing a
$ functions >> ~/.zshenv
in my .zshrc as a shortcut but this puts all the autoloaded functions =
into the env file causing error messages when completion is first =
attempted etc. like:
$ cd sss<tab>
_next_label:comptags:8: no tags registered

Does anyone have a better solution / workaround to this problem. Or is =
exported functions somewhere in the feature-list ?

Thanks,
Suresh
