Hi all,
	I'm trying to match files which aren't executable for the following 
completion:

zstyle ':completion:*:complete:-command-::commands' ignored-patterns

I tried this:

zstyle ':completion:*:complete:-command-::commands' ignored-patterns 
'*^((x)|(X)|(E))'

thinking that that would translate to "complete everything besides a 
file with the user, group, or other executable bit set", but that 
stopped completing all files which were executable.  Can anyone 
explain?  What is a better way to do this?

Thanks.
