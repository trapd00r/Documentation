Why limit it to PM_UNIQUE?  Surely there are other flags etc. that should
be mirrored along with the values ... `integer', for example ... but then
there are some, such as `exported', that should not be mirrored ...  hmm.

} I think, that it would be better solved by adding one more flag (say,
} PM_MIRRORED). It would provide for creating arbitrary user defined paires
} of mirrored parameters.

This would be great; however, we'd also need flags for PM_COLONARRAY to
identify arrays that should be colon-separated, and maybe a flag for
variables that should never become unset.
