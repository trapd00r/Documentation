Actually, I meant to send it to zsh-workers only, but I accidentally
sent it to zsh-users.  In mutt, I hit reply when the cursor was on that
message by that John guy who wanted a zsh equivalent of the bash
completion project.  Little did he know... haha.  But anyway, I got rid
of the In-Reply-To: header, but failed to notice the To: header said
zsh-users in it.

However, it seems as if I've helped at least one person on zsh-users who
had some nice things to say in a private email, so it was a fortunate
accident.

I'm kinda hoping people can give it a glance, and figure out what zsh is
by using their intuition.

I had the same feeling, but I didn't know where to put it, and by the
time I got to the end of writing, I forgot about it.  I think I'll
mention it somewhere in the concluding parts.

I looked into that, and it turns out you're right.  There is a French
adieu that means goodbye, and it's totally unrelated to the English ado
which has the meaning that I actually wanted.  Good catch.

OK.

I think how I'll do it is by putting a comment in the code listing
with a message that states that there's a new and improved one coming
up.  The only reason I didn't use your suggestions in the main listing
was that I wanted to show people how states worked.


    Peace,

PS: I have some urgent business to take care of, and I might not have
    the time to address some of the comments I saw on zsh-workers until
    tomorrow or even Sunday.  I've read them, and I have replies to them
    stewing in my mind, but I don't have time to write them down.
    Please be patient with me.
