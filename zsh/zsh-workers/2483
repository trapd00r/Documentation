I'm curious.... why?  And what happens if you bind them using bindkey?
Can we use other ESC-prefixed bindings in vi-insert mode?

My version of vi ("nvi 1.34") allows me to use the cursor keys during
insert mode - with the obvious bindings: (output of :map!)

  ^[OA  ^[ka  cursor up
  ^[OB  ^[ja  cursor down
  ^[OC  ^[la  cursor right
  ^[OD  ^[ha  cursor left 

Cheers,



Duncan.
