Greetings,

I think my problem is quite simple, but I'm unable to find a solution.
It is based on a bash script and I use the following lines:

CLOCKPARAMS="${CLOCKPARAMS} --utc"
hwclock --hctosys ${CLOCKPARAMS}

The result is:

CLOCKPARAMS=' --utc'
hwclock --hctosys ' --utc'        # --> hwclock error

How do I prevent zsh from inserting the quotes in the hwclock-command? I
played with some expansionmodifiers - such a 'Q' - but I can't get it to
work.

Thanks
Matthias Berndt
