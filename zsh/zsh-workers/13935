Subject: Suggestion for ChangeLog files
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Let's merge ChangeLog and ChangeLog-Release and name that ChangeLog-3.1,
and start a new ChangeLog with the 4.0.1 release.  (So there'd be no
ChangeLog-Release any longer.)

Alternately, do same but but keep log entries beginning with 4.0.1-pre-1
in ChangeLog, because of the file renaming between -pre-2 and -pre-3.
