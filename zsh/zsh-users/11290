} I think I did that.

No, Frank (I think that was Frank) is talking about the /etc/zshenv file,
which unless you are the machine administrator you probably don't even
have permission to edit.

} #export PS1="[$(print '%{\e[1;33m%}%n: \e[1;35m%}%d%{\e[0m%}')]>"
} #export RPS1="%M"
} 
} As you can see, I commented the export command, and ULALA :  I IS  
} WOOOORKING        !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

OK, that confirms that the prompt was the problem.

} What is the correct way, to individualize my prompt ?

(1) Remove the word "export" from each of those two lines.

(2) Add the missing %{ to the PS1 assignment.

Which results in:

PS1="[$(print '%{\e[1;33m%}%n: %{\e[1;35m%}%d%{\e[0m%}')]>"
RPS1="%M"
