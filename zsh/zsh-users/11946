PS1='%S%# '

that sets my prompt to reverse video, and it works fine if i tab-complete. 
but....

PS1='%{^[[36m%}%# '

that sets my prompt to cyan, but reverts to default colors when i 
tab-complete.

is there a way to set a color at the prompt that doesn't reset to default 
when i tab-complete?

thanks...

 	 so-called defense can actually defend us against a
 	 terrorist bomb. Nothing in our enormous military
 	 establishment can actually give us one whit of
 	 security. That is a military fact... In country
 	 after country, our government has thwarted
 	 democracy, stifled freedom, and trampled human
 	 rights. That's why we are hated around the world...
 	 We are not hated because we practice democracy,
 	 freedom, and human rights. We are hated because our
 	 government denies these things to people in third
 	 world countries whose resources are coveted by our
 	 multinational corporations... We must change our
 	 government's ways... Only one thing has ever ended a
 	 terrorist campaign - denying the terrorist
 	 organization the support of the larger community it
 	 represents... Remove the desperation, give them some
 	 hope, and support for terrorism will evaporate. At
 	 that point bin Laden will be forced to abandon
 	 terrorism or be treated like a common criminal.
 	 Either way, he and his money cease to be a threat. We
 	 CAN have security ... or we can have revenge. We
 	 cannot have both."
