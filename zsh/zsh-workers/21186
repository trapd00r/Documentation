Yeah, that's what I wanted. Actually, a way to specify an arbitrary
command to execute after everything is loaded (or not, with -f) would
be a bit more general because you'd just set it to ". ./configfile"...
Sure, making a temporary directory with a special .zshrc in it is
mostly equivalent, but seems like zsh shouldn't make you go through
that mess.

Sort of like preexec, except that it executes not *before* the command
but *instead of* the command. So you could set it to something like

myexec () { "$@" }

for normal behavior, or if you wanted to, say, send the commands to
your favorite app that doesn't have a readline interface, you could do
that instead. People may say it's too powerful ... but I still think
it would be nice.
