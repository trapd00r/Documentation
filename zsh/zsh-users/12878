It does here, I don't know why it doesn't for you, unless you haven't
initialized the completion system at all.

To make the keybindings like they are when EDITOR=emacs, just run
bindkey -e. To make those two specific binds only, you can use bindkey
'^A' beginning-of-line; bindkey '^E' end-of-line.
