With `completion system', do you mean the new, function-based one?

That does all this automatically for me. Even recognising that $PATH
gets a colon-separated list of directories.


If you are using compctl (which you shouldn't), use something like:

  compctl -v -x 'C[0,*:*] n[-1,:]' -f - 'C[0,*=*] n[1,=]' -f -- export

(I think it was...)
