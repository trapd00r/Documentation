} Not worth it.  POSIX leaves the behaviour undefined IIRC, and there's
} no advantage in the traditional behaviour.

You're right about POSIX, but since it makes a pretty radical difference
to the parse of a script containing unbalanced backticks, the advantage
to the traditional behavior is to be able to execute traditional scripts.
We can decide that's not very important, but it is something.

BTW:  Zoltan:  Welcome back. ;-)
