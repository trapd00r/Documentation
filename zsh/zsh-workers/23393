I think I see what you mean now... we can simply always leave stat
disabled if it was, because we never actually use it any more.  So the
only issue is what happens at the point a module first loads zsh/stat.
I presume you're suggesting "zmodload zsh/stat; disable stat" at start-up
is the way to fix this.

I'd still prefer a general solution along the lines of the feature
mechanism, which requires (as far as I can see) no kludging or removal
of anything, but I have had absolutely no response to that.
