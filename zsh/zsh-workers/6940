I'm not happy with it either.  It works, but it looks like a hack.
Comment from zsh.h:
	#define STAT_NOPRINT    (1<<5)  /* job was killed internally,    */
	                                /*   we don't want to show that  */
Is STAT_NOPRINT being used for other purposes now?  Are we getting the wrong
status for jobs while trying to work around all these other programs which
want certain pgrp/session requirements?

PS. breakage occured between pws-22 and pws-23
