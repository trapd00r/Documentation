} The following is how perl does it, marking an `eval' as a separate
} environment.

I was fooling with almost exactly the same thing, though I'd been trying
to figure out a nice way to embed the line number of the eval inside the
`(eval)' string; e.g. for an eval on line 30 of the calling function you
would see something like

(30:eval):1: echo foo
(30:eval):2: echo bar

etc.  However, as the placment of %i and the use of colons or whatnot is
completely dependent on the PS4 setting, I couldn't decide how to do it
such that it wouldn't garble somebody's pretty prompt.
