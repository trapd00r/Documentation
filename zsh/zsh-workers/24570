} : _path_commands:15:then then for; line=whatis: -s: unknown option

I tweaked _path_commands to replace "whatis -s" with "apropos" and now
I can reproduce the original failure.

The problem is that at the line above in _path_commands, PREFIX is
always "xsane_g" (using PWS's test) and never "(#a1)xsane_g".

Looking through the output, PREFIX gets set by the replacement compadd
created via _approximate -- but that doesn't happen until *inside* the
call to _wanted, long after the test in _path_commands.

So the solution is to remove the attempt by _path_commands to pre-filter
on PREFIX, and instead simply pass the whole damned array through, as is
done with "compadd -k commands" in the no-descriptions branch.

However, I must say that I'm not all that thrilled with the whole idea
behind _path_commands, now that I look at it.  Caching or not, I don't
really want the entire contents of the whatis database dumped into my
shell.  Consequently I'm quite happy at the moment that "whatis -s"
does not work correctly on my system, and I'd respectfully ask that
someone else undertake to add a much more specific ztyle than just
(as currently used) "verbose", that must be set to enable this.

Meanwhile, here's the simple patch to fix the prefix matching.
