I have just finished reading the zsh man pages or at least Doc/*.1 ones, and
I didn't see anything about this.

I've tested both bindkey vi insert mode and command mode and neither seems
to emulate tcsh

I want to be able to run a command and then just hit "up" or control p and 
have that command pop back up without having to hit escape first. Is there
an easy way to do this.

Next I don't like the way the complete prints the choices below the prompt
is there a way to make it above the prompt

Thanks
Brian
