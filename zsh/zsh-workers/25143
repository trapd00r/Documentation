I was bored so i ran for a (**/*.yo) {aspell -c $a} and here's what came 
out. (after pressing i many many times).

I looked up descendent/descendant, according to what i found, one is a 
noun and the other is an adjective, so i changed them. If you know this to 
be wrong, ignore those hunks.

There is also this:
% grep programme **/*.yo|wc -l
12
% grep program\  **/*.yo|wc -l
11

I can send a patch to make it consistent, but which do you prefer?
