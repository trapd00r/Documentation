Thanx Bart,
replying to your post which hasn't appeared yet!

zsh -fx

solved all my problems

setopt returned a list of options
I was able to setopt extendedglob
and
ls *.csv~yy.csv now works,


>>>Try to run  zsh -fx  and see what happens.  The option -f 
(NO_RCS) tells zsh to ignore all initialization files except 
/etc/zshenv; -x turns on XTRACE, which tells zsh to 
print everything what is done. 


so now to work out what is frigomatic with my existing settings!
