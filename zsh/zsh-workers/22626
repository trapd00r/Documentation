yes, i see that is not a good idea then.

if one only uses one color , you mean?
perhaps i was mistaken to think that every escape code needs
needs these %{ %} around it.
so i thought it really had to be done  with any new one.

That wouuld really be nice!

The biggest problem in zsh functions is readability
already. As much as i love zsh features and what pleasure
they bring to console life i think that these already come
with a very big cost: and that is very bad readability.
Nearly every line in /usr/share/zsh/*/functions is so
stuffed that it needs much concentration to understand what
it's doing. So much, that i sometimes think of using m4 to
use zsh features in shell programming and that is extremely alarming!
[ And does not at all help in reading other code ]

And prompt definitions belong in this category, too.
