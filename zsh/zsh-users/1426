} That's a terminal issue.  Some terminals send "^[OA" instead of "^[[A".

Actually, it's a keypad transmit mode issue, I think.  vt100s and their
emulators in keypad mode send the '\eO' sequences, and in standard mode
send the '\e[' sequences.  You can often see this by typing ctrl-V up
in the shell, then starting vi and typing ctrl-V up in insert mode.

Some versions of the vt100 and xterm termcap/terminfo entries always put
the terminal in keypad mode, others switch into it in the ti/te ("Begin
program that uses cursor motion") capabilities, still others never leave
standard mode.  It's really annoying, especially on e.g. Linux where the
Num Lock key controls whether the -keyboard- really is in keypad mode.
