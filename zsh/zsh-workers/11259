0. If a completion function knows the precious command behavior, use
   the knowledge.

1. If `-s' is not specified, it's not getopt.

2. If the environment variable POSIXLY_CORRECT is set, assume
   traditional getopt.

3. If on GNU system such as Linux, assume GNU getopt.

4. If it is not cases above, assume traditional getopt.

I think this guess is not so bad.
