I agree, but this wasn't really my question. The main problem is that
this feature isn't documented in zshzle, therefore more difficult to
find.

I reformulate my question: couldn't edit-command-line become more
official and be documented in the zshzle man page?

Also,

  autoload edit-command-line
  zle -N edit-command-line
  bindkey '\ee' edit-command-line

is more code to type (even if it is done once). Could there be a zsh
option so that

  bindkey '\ee' edit-command-line

automatically calls autoload and zle -N if need be?

OK. BTW, why is FCEDIT defined by default as "vi"? Why not let it
unset, in which case $VISUAL or $EDITOR would be used?
