I tried it.  And there seems to be a bug, something seems to be called twice. I
added a fake style to enscript --font.  It seems like _description got called
twice.  Since the description was listed twice.  Also, to actually set the fake
style, I had two double the argument field twice.

Is there a way to remove an existing item?   So if completion would generate a
word, is way to have it not be listed/provided as an option.

Otherwise, it looks good to me, and I would say worthwhile.
