I found that the usual zsh behaviour of alt-. could be had in any other
terminal but xterm, or on the console.

I downgraded to xterm 4.1.0 (from 4.3.0), and the problem is fixed.

I've filed a bug report in the (debian) system, under xterm.

I'm very relieved to be able to get back to business.

Thanks,
