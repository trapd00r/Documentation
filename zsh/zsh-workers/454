This seems to pop up regularly enough to make it worth kludging... A
detect of the problem should be easy enough to at least point out the
problem exists on machine X. Perhaps even a script that _works_ on the
broken nawk's could be produced....

Unfortunately all the nawks at hand seem to produce identical results
to gawk. Shame, I was looking for a reason to put off the work I
should be doing... :-)
