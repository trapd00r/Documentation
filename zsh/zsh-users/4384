} What option should I use (the -p<num> options don't do anything)?

You probably needed -p0 to tell it not to strip off any path components
at all.

} Moreover, why did I need to delete the .zcompdump file?

That one I can't tell you.  It sure looks like you got some stray output
written into the .zcompdump file.  Do you perhaps have a preexec that
emits something to stdout?  Unlike precmd, which executes only when a
prompt is printed, preexec executes before *every* top-level command,
even when running shell scripts.
