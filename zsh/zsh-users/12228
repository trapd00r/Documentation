I think there's something we don't know going on, since running the
builtin widget backward-kill-word 10 times in a row shouldn't get you to
this point:  it's only reached if the previous widget wasn't a kill
command.

At this point in debugging, could you run 

  p kringnum
  p kringsize
  p kring

Thanks.
