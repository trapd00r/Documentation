From: Peter Stephenson <pws@csr.com>

I've uploaded zsh-4.1.1-test-2 to ftp://ftp.zsh.org/pub/development/ .

Principal changes since test-1

- Fix/workaround for multios and >(...) subsitutions being
  asynchronous.  See MULTIOS documentation in zshmisc.1.
- Various additional and refined completion functions
- zshcompsys.1 completely rephrased
- Possible fix for Cygwin compilation problem of TCP modules
- Menu selection fixed on Linux console

It looks sort of like the fix for failed TIOCGWINSZ ioctl (used to set
window size to 0 on a SIGWINCH but that's not actually very useful) kind
of sneaked in while I was committing other stuff without being
documented.  I'll note it in the ChangeLog for the next version.

Various spelling corrections, small bug fixes, etc.

Still (not exactly) waiting for:
- possible fix for handling of option prefixes in _describe
