Good point.

Well, setserial doesn't like "^pgrp_lockout", but "^session_lockout"
seems to help in that I can interrupt the zsh using ^C - but that ends
the zsh session which is not exactly what I want :)

Uhm... the trick is not even that complicated: Just use /sbin/getty
instead of /sbin/mgetty - voila, all works like a charm :-)

Now guess why it's called m(odem)getty and not vtgetty :)

Thanks,
Thomas
