Erm, presumably you have something like
zstyle ':completion:*' use-cache on
zstyle ':completion:*' cache-path ~/var/cache/$HOST
set, so there's little reason for it to appear in /var .

You already have the ability to change cache-path for certain contexts,
so you could have Debian packages cached into /var/cache/$HOST if you
wanted, though if the purpose of that is to share the caches between
users, I think this could subject you to problems concerning
file ownership/permissions, locking, differing cache policies, and
whatnot, or maybe these aren't actual problems in practice.

Maybe someone else on the list is doing something similar or has
additional thoughts.
