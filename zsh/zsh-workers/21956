I thought about that.  We can't use 10 or higher as we'd like (that's
where the shell will put the fd's it uses) since the shell syntax
doesn't support it.  I couldn't think of any really good reason to pick
9 rather than 3, but it's an easy change that's at worst harmless if you
want to change it.  I've now committed the patch with an extra comment.
