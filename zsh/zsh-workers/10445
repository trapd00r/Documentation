If you can see the cvs log information easily then you can just checkout the
source at a certain date (either before or after the patch).  Or if want
something specific to a file or set of files, generate a ChangeLog with
version numbers, e.g. using a fairly current version of rcs2log, then you
can get the affected files by version number.
