} % t=( vic/ab/test.java(:s/.java/.class) )

I have -no- idea why that worked at all.  vic/ab/test.java is not a glob
pattern, so (:s/.java/.class) should not have been taken as a qualifier.
(Either that, or the documentation is woefully inaccurate.)

% t=( vic/ab/test.java(.) )
% echo $t
vic/ab/test.java(.)

Given that it was taken as a qualifier and therefore interpreted as a
modifier, you're right, the first close-paren should have ended it.

So there appear to be two bugs here.  Look at this:

%  t=( vic/ab/test.java(.:s/.java/.class) )
zsh: no match

That `:' is causing magic that it shouldn't cause.
