Not very intuitive that is it.

I recently wanted to loop over an array's elements in reverse and
though I could do it with a for loop counting the indices backwards I
did think that there ought to be a better way.

Allowing array slices to go backwards, is a possibility though I'd not
be suprised if implementing it caused other things to break. The
easiest might be a parameter expension flag (r and R are gone so we'd
need a letter. ^ perhaps as we used that for the reversed prompt
state). Does anyone else have any views on whether we should add
something for this and if so how?
