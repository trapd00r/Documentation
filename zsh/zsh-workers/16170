    Hello Andrej :))

    Oh, now I understand, sorry O:). Yes, this sound reasonable.

    Sorry, I didn't read that explanation, so the question.

>It is possible to add --with-moddir=... configure parameter that

    That will do for me, thanks :))))

    I find it reasonable. If the modules are found thru 'zsh/module'
obviously it doesn't worth the effort of redesigning and the like.

    Well, sorry then for the useless question, and thank you very
much for your help. As I said, you're great ;))

    Raúl
