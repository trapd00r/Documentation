I have moved my partially written User's Guide to the Z-Shell to the main
web site, i.e.
  http://sunsite.auc.dk/zsh/
in the subdirectory Guide.

Comments are welcome, particularly things I've said work that actually
don't.  Note, however, that you will need an up-to-date development version
to try out the stuff on new completion in chapter 6.

Comments on the way I've messed up the alterations to the web pages are
also welcome.
