Sure; compstate[compound_word] doesn't have to be read-only, any function
that needs it could set it.  It just seems correct and convenient to have
compvalues set it automatically.

There's one line of shell code where you have compstate[compound] but want
compstate[compound_word].  No need to repost, but fix before commit.

I don't have time to debug carefully just now, but I suspect without any 
real evidence that compstate[compound_word] is becoming unset on return 
from the nested call and therefore is wrong for the subsequent selections
for the outer call.
