There wasn't much of an uproar, so I've now committed it. I really
prefer to have this cleaned up, as we did with other tags some time
ago.

As a reminder, this patch changes some tags used for looking up styles 
in filename completion, namely:

  file-sort       no tag
  fake-files      no tag
  ignore-parents  no tag
  accept-exact    `paths' tag

Bye
 Sven
