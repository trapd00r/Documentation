} same as !$ but more useful as history is not available in an  alias (?)

History is expanded before aliases are, so that's correct.

} is this zsh only? are there any more eg first argument

I believe this was borrowed from ksh.  No, there are not any others,
but $_ is used for some other things in other contexts.
