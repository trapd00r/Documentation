The option itself isn't broken; what's broken is the completion code
that fails to make use of it.

That code was written by Sven W., who has left university, gotten a
job, and does not follow the zsh lists with any regularity any more.
So you might hope, but it may not be all that near a future before
anyone else understands this well enough to repair it.

Besides that, there are several of the completion shell functions that
fail when that option is set, so those also need to be fixed before it
would do any good to fix comptry.

So ... don't stop hoping, but get used to typing "ls \{" before you
hit TAB.
