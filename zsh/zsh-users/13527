You want both of the things suggested in this thread ('-f' and '(N)'):

# original problem
$ rm non-existing-file.*
zsh: no matches found: non-existing-file.*

# '-f' doesn't solve 'no matches'
$ rm -f non-existing-file.*
zsh: no matches found: non-existing-file.*

# '(N)' doesn't solve the 'missing operand'
$ rm non-existing-file.*(N)
rm: missing operand
Try `rm --help' for more information.

# '(N)' solves one, '-f' solves the other
$ rm -f non-existing-file.*(N)
$


Best,
Ben
