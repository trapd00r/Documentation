There are function widgets; see zshcontrib.

   up-line-or-beginning-search, down-line-or-beginning-search
          These   widgets   are   similar   to   the   builtin   functions
          up-line-or-search and down-line-or-search:  if  in  a  multiline
          buffer  they  move  up or down within the buffer, otherwise they
          search for a history line matching  the  start  of  the  current
          line.   In  this  case,  however,  they  search for a line which
          matches the current line up to the current cursor  position,  in
          the  manner  of  history-beginning-search-backward and -forward,
          rather than the first word on the line.
