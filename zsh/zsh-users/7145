Try http://www.zsh.sunsite.dk/Guide/ chapter 6, although that's not
perfect.

Otherwise wait for the forthcoming `From Bash to Zsh: Conquring the
Command Line' by Kiddle, Peek and Stephenson, due from Apress in June.

Yep, sorry, you need:

zstyle ':completion:*:complete:(cd|pushd):*' tag-order - \
  'local-directories path-directories directory-stack' 'named-directories'

The `-' means don't try anything else, otherwise they are added at the
end of the list.  This is in the manual entry for the tag-order style.
