Hello,

I'm using zsh 4.3.4, but I saw on sourceforge site it's a development
version, and last stable version is 4.2.6, released in 2005.

Is it correct? I'm asking because the version o FreeBSD port is 4.3.2,
and the port is not marked as -devel, so, maybe we need to have 2
ports, shells/zsh -> 4.2.6 and shells/zsh-devel -> 4.3.x

Is there any prevision to 4.3.x become stable?

Thanks
