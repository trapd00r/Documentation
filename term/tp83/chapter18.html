<H1 CLASS="chapterhead">Modems and Intelligent Communications Processors</H1>
<H2>Introduction</H2>
<P>Your system, whether composed of one computer and a single terminal or many
computers and terminals using highly sophisticated software, forms a communications
network. In order to transfer information between members of the network &#8211;
CPU to CPU, CPU to terminal, or CPU to printer &#8211; you need data communication
equipment. Modems and intelligent communications processors (ICPs) are the two
most popular types. A critical part of the network, modems and ICPs are often the
crucial factor in determining network throughput and reliability.</P>
<P>Data terminal equipment transfers information in a digital format, while telephone
lines carry information in an analog format, continuously varying voltage
and frequency. Thus, it is necessary to convert digital data to analog format for
transmission over telephone line. This is performed by a modem. Information
entering the communications link is modulated on a carrier wave. Information
leaving the data link is demodulated so that only the original signal exists when it
leaves the modem or an ICP with a modem. In effect, the information (digital signal)
is piggybacked on the carrier wave, allowing it to be transmitted over great distances
via the telephone network.</P>
<P>Data communications equipment is used in every work equipment &#8211; commercial,
scientific, industrial, and manufacturing. Personal computers, office information
systems, word processing workstations, and timesharing systems need data
communications equipment to link them to other systems or to other databases.</P>
<P>Digital's modems and intelligent communications processors work with any
Digital and most non-Digital processors running an operating system having a terminal
driver utility, a communications interface or port, and an EIA terminal or
printer.</P>
<H2>Selection Criteria</H2>
<P>When you decide to buy data communications equipment, there are several factors
to consider.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Your application</LI>
<LI>Compatibility with industry standards</LI>
<LI>Growth of the present system</LI>
<LI>Reliability</LI>
<LI>Service and Support</LI>
<LI>Ease of configuration</LI>
<LI>Standard features</LI>
<LI>Customer installability</LI>
</UL>
<H3>Your Application</H3>
<P>A dialup modem allows a single user to tap into many different databases as work
demands via public telephone lines. The cost of operating a dialup modem is low
since only small amounts of data are being transmitted via telephone lines. The
dialup modem gives you the greatest versatility since you are not restricted to a
particular database. Digital offers the DF02 and DF03 family of modems.</P>
<P>Multiplexers, such as Digital's DFM series of Intelligent Communications Processors
(ICPs), are better for a multiuser remote cluster environment where small
groups need to access a central database. In this situation, you generally transmit
data via leased lines. Since only the leasee has access to the line, data can be
transmitted at a faster rate. Leased lines can be expensive, but for dedicated applications
they are efficient and cost effective.</P>
<H3>Compatibility with Industry Standards</H3>
<P>It is essential for your data communications equipment to be compatible with
industry standards. Such standards prevent your application and database from
being restricted from future growth. These standards, such as the Bell System's
212A, allow you to transmit data asynchronously at 300 or 1,200 bits per second, or
synchronously at 1,200 bits per second. All Digital modems and intelligent communications
processors meet industry standards.</P>
<P>Some telephone lines need to be used for both telephone calls and data transmission.
If this is the case in your office, then you need a modem with the alternate
voice/data feature. This feature enables your telephone line to be used for both
telephone calls and data transmission. It is more cost effective since you do not
need two separate lines &#8211; one line for telephone calls and a separate line for data
transmission. The alternate voice/data feature is standard on Digital's DF02 and
DF03 modems.</P>
<H3>Growth Potential</H3>
<P>As your operation grows, your network must grow along with it. Your network
probably contains equipment from different vendors. For your network to grow,
there must be compatibility across the network. As hardware enhancements come
along, you must be able to upgrade your existing hardware, not throw it away. As
you add new equipment to your network, look for equipment that is similar in operation
to existing equipment, so your staff will not require extensive retraining. Look
at the different configuration options that are available.</P>
<H3>Reliability</H3>
<P>The reliability of your modem and ICP is very important. As long as your data terminal
equipment is working, your system &#8211; whether large or small &#8211; continues to
transfer data. A system that stays up allows your staff to make efficient use of work
time.</P>
<H3>Support and Service</H3>
<P>Unfortunately, there may be times when you are unable to transmit data. Support
after the data communications equipment has been purchased is another factor to
think about. It is valuable if you can perform a series of tests to find out where the
problem lies. This way, you don't waste valuable time checking many different
components &#8211; you can go directly to the malfunctioning one and fix it. If you have
a service contract, you need to be able to pin-point where the problem exists, at the
transmitting or the receiving end. If you need field service, you only want to pay for
a call at the end that needs help, not the good end as well.</P>
<H3>Ease of Configuration</H3>
<P>One of the most important considerations is whether or not you can select the baud
rate. If the processor and the terminal operate at two different speeds, your modem
or ICP can compensate for this by transmitting data at the rate the slower device
can handle. Another consideration is whether the cable is included with the
modem. Digital lets you order a cable, if you need it, and lets you specify the length
required for your application.</P>
<H3>Standard Features</H3>
<P>Ask:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Is autodialing standard or optional?</LI>
<LI>What internal diagnostics are standard &#8211; self-test, loopback self-testing, and
analog testing?</LI>
</UL>
<H3>Customer Installability</H3>
<P>If the modem or intelligent communications processor is designed for customer installability
and is sold with everything you need for operation, you can be all set to
transmit data in less than 30 minutes. Always follow the manufacturer's installation
manual to insure the best results.</P>

</TABLE>
<H3>Overview</H3>
<P>The DF02 is a freestanding, full-duplex, asynchronous direct-connect modem that
allows terminals and processors to communicate over unconditioned dialup or two-wire
leased lines. This direct connection reduces noise and increases the reliability
of the telephone line connection over that provided by acoustically coupled
modems.</P>
<P>The DF02 modem is designed to serve the needs of Digital's users who are
involved in low-speed networking applications. It operates at data rates between
zero and 300 bits per second and is functionally compatible with the Bell System
103J Data Set. Due to the Bell System's "Lease Only" policy and the lack of field
support by the majority of independent vendors, the DF02 has the additional
advantage of being fully supported by Digital's service organization.</P>
<P>The DF02 is a high-quality, reliable product that features both local and remote
test capabilities, as well as capabilities for manually or automatically originating
and answering calls. It is compatible with all of Digital's asynchronous data communication
controllers that support the EIA RS232-C interface standard and that
offer PSTN modem control, for example, the DH11, DZ11, DZV11, and DL11-E.
The DF02 is approved by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for
direct connection to the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) via a standard
RJ11C modular jack. The DF02 also offers alternate voice/data capabilities when a
standard telephone set is used to originate and answer calls manually.</P>
<P>The unit provides a variety of other options and features, designed to allow for
maximum flexibility in the network environment. A standard factory-installed customer
configuration has been developed to meet the requirements of the typical
Digital equipment user. Only if you have special requirements will you need to
reconfigure the unit.</P>
<P>The DF02 is offered in two basic configurations &#8211; the DF02-AA and the DF02-AC.
Both configurations provide manual originate, manual answer, and automatic
answer modes. In addition, the DF02-AC provides an automatic originate (call)
mode through the use of the serial asynchronous automatic calling unit (ACU)
that's an integral part of the unit.</P>
<P>The DF02 is available for sale only in the United States. Contact your local
Digital representative for more information.</P>
<H3>Major Features</H3>
<P>The major features of the DF02 are:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Automatic/manual originate and answer capabilities &#8211; Allows the unit to be
used in either attended or unattended configurations.</LI>
<LI>Full-duplex operation over two-wire unconditioned telephone lines &#8211;
Increases network efficiency and reduces line costs.</LI>
<LI>FCC approval for direct connection to telephone lines &#8211; Eliminates need for
Data Access Arrangements (DAA).</LI>
<LI>RJ11C modular voice jack connection &#8211; This portability allows you increased
flexibility in network configuration. Makes installation quick and simple.</LI>
<LI>Remote and local loopback &#8211; Decreases maintenance costs and network
downtime.</LI>
<LI>Operational simplicity &#8211; Requires minimum operator training time and
expense.</LI>
<LI>Serial automatic call mode (DF02-AC only) &#8211; Allows for unattended automatic
origination of calls by a processor and/or by terminal keyboard dialing.</LI>
<LI>Field Service contract availability &#8211; Offers on-site maintenance and single-vendor
solutions to data communication link hardware problems.</LI>
</UL>
<H3>Operator Features</H3>
<P>The DF02 can originate or answer calls to or from remote stations both manually
and automatically. When the modem places a call, it is in the originate mode.
When responding to a call, it is in the answer mode. Operation is quite simple.</P>
<P>When you're originating a call manually, dial the number. When the answering
tone is received, place the Data/Talk button in the Data position and replace the
telephone handset. When the carrier light comes on, data transmission begins. An
incoming call can be answered automatically (without attendant intervention) or
manually by the attendant. When answering manually, you, when ready, place the
Data/Talk button in the Data position and replace the telephone handset. When
the carrier light comes on, data transmission begins.</P>
<P>Operating procedures for the DF02-AC are the same as for the DF02-AA except
that the DF02-AC allows you to dial the desired number through the terminal keyboard
rather than using the telephone and it allows a properly programmed unattended
system to initiate a call.</P>
<H3>Maintenance</H3>
<P>The DF02 is designed to be installed by either you or a Digital Field Service technician.
Since the DF02 is a freestanding device, it needs no mounting hardware. A
standard telephone handset, when used with the DF02, can be placed on top of the
case. To install the DF02, unplug the four-contact RJ11C voice jacks connecting the
telephone to its wallbox and insert the jack into the rear panel of the DF02. Plug the
DF02's telephone cable into the wallbox where the telephone was previously connected.
Connect the Electronic Industries Association (EIA) data cable into the 25-pin
connector on the rear panel of the DF02. Then plug the DF02's AC line cord
into a three-prong, 120-volt, 60-Hertz wall outlet.</P>
<P>The DF02 requires no preventative maintenance. In addition, the DF02 is backed
by an available Field Service contract to provide onsite maintenance.</P>

<H3>Overview</H3>
<P>With the rapid growth of office automation and small business systems, the need
for data communication becomes increasingly more important. Word processing
stations, electronic mail networks, and record control systems rely heavily on the 
transmission of data to remote locations.</P>
<P>The DF03 is a cost-competitive, 300/1,200 bits per second, stand-alone, direct-connect
modem. If your application involves low-to-medium-speed networking
applications or timesharing environments, the DF03 is designed for you. If gives
terminals and processors the capability of full-duplex, synchronous/asynchronous,
binary, serial data communications over two-wire public switched telephone network
(PSTN) facilities.</P>
<P>A communications network may consist of a CPU and a single terminal or of many
widely separated remote system nodes. The freestanding DF03 can transfer data
between CPUs and remote terminals or between CPUs. Lightweight and compact, it
can be easily positioned on a desk or table close to the computer or terminal. The
DF03's full-duplex, 1,200-bits-per-second, synchronous mode of operation is useful
for CPU-to-CPU communications and block mode terminal applications.</P>
<P>Low-speed operation (0 through 300 bits per second) is asynchronous, binary
Frequency Shift Keying (FSK), while medium-speed operation (1,200 bits per second)
can be either character-asynchronous or bit-synchronous, Quarternary Differential
Phase Shift Keying (QDPSK). The DF03 is functionally compatible with the
Bell System 103J (low-speed applications) and 212A (medium-speed applications)
Data Sets. It is approved by the FCC for direct connection to the public switched
telephone network via a standard RJ11C modular voice jack.</P>
<P>The DF03 is offered in four basic configurations:</P>
<DL>
<DT><CITE>DF03-AA</CITE></DT>
<DD>Provides manual originate, manual answer, and automatic answer modes.</DD>
<DT><CITE>DF03-AC</CITE></DT>

</UL>
<H3>Operator Features</H3>
<P>Originating calls and answering calls manually with the DF03 modems is easy.
After setting the appropriate switches, which are described in detail in the <CITE>DF03
Modem Family User Guide</CITE>, and verifying the status of the modem, you dial the
desired number on the telephone. To answer a call manually, just verify the status
of the modem, answer the call, and set the appropriate switch on the modem.</P>
<P>The DF03 automatic call option enables the modem to be operated unattended.
To establish communication with a remote location, the automatic call unit option
dials the desired telephone number using serial binary data. The automatic call
feature provides either of the following capabilities: keyboard dialing from a terminal,
or program dialing from an unattended processor.</P>
<H3>Maintenance</H3>
<P>DF03 modems and modem modules are factory-configured for compatibility with
most data communications equipment. In some cases, however, you will want to
choose different options. If this is the case, check the <CITE>DF03 Modem Family User
Guide</CITE>.</P>
<P>The DF03 is very reliable and easy to maintain. No preventative maintenance is
necessary. You can install it yourself, or have Digital's Field Service personnel
install it. Field Service maintenance contracts are available for onsite service.</P>
<P>Status lights and switches, located on the front panel of the DF03 units, are used
to monitor and control the operation of the modem. Modem loopback test features
allow for testing the local terminal interface and modem. Additional test features
verify the operation of the communication link and remote modem. The modems
can also perform a self-test to ensure that the internal modem logic is functioning
properly. These tests effectively decrease maintenance costs and network downtime.</P>
<P>Because the DF03 modems are approved by the FCC for direct connection to
telephone lines, the Data Access Arrangement (DAA) equipment usually required
for installation is not necessary. The single data port for both the autocall unit
(ACU) and the modem decreases hardware costs and physical space requirements.
The RJ11C modular jack on the DF03 freestanding modems are easily connected to
standard telephone outlets in the United States and Canada. You can quickly
disconnect the DF03 and relocate it to another telephone outlet as needed.</P>

</TABLE>
<H3>Overview</H3>
<P>The DF100-RM multiple-modem enclosure is cost-effective when more than five
centrally located remote connections are required. It gives you the flexibility to
integrate new modems within the enclosure for future expansion. The modem
enclosure supports either Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) or Private/Leased
Telephone Network (P/LTN) applications. The type of modem or modem
configuration is determined by the synchronous and asynchronous data formats
and has the capability of either 0-to-300 bits-per-second of 1,200-bits-per-second
operation. This flexibility allows you to enhance your network application at no
additional cost.</P>
<P>Easily installed into a 48.3-cm (19.0-in) cabinet or rack and requiring only 26.7-cm
(10.5-in) of vertical mounting space, this space-saving enclosure houses up to
12 DF03-RA/RC single-card modem modules. The modem connections use the
standard RS-232C 25-pin cinch connector. The rack enclosure with a standard 120-volt
power supply also accepts a redundant power regulator option (DF100-PR),
which allows it to assume the power load if the primary supply fails.</P>
<P>The DF100-RM rack enclosure uses the DF03-RA and DF03-RC modems. Please
see the preceding description and specifications.</P>
<H3>Major Features</H3>

<H3>Operator Features</H3>
<P>The DFM Intelligent Communications Processor provides six front panel pushbutton
switches. These switches allow you to select initial operating characteristics that
are associated with modem facilities and manual maintenance mode. There are
also eight front panel LED indicators that verify modem signals, link readiness,
error condition flags, and channel activity. Because of the ICP's microprocessor
design and built-in software, most of the variables that characterize the DFM network
configuration are selected and embedded in the system by software control.
This is done by using a terminal that is attached to a special connection called the
supervisory command channel. Therefore, your terminal's keyboard is the most
significant control for the ICP.</P>
<P>The following summarizes the pushbutton switches and LED indicators found
on the integral modem of the ICP.</P>
<H4>Local loopback (LL)</H4>
<P>When pressed in, the integral modem is placed in analog loopback mode.</P>
<H4>Test Pattern (TP)</H4>
<P>When pressed in, the integral modem outputs a test pattern to all devices attached
to that DFM unit.</P>
<H4>Remote Loopback (RL)</H4>
<P>When pressed in, this switch forces the integral modem at the other end of the link
into digital loopback mode.</P>
<H4>Digital Loopback (DL)</H4>
<P>This switch, when pressed in, places the integral modem in digital loopback. This
allows the integral modem at the other end of the link to execute loopback.</P>
<H4>Fallback (FB)</H4>
<P>When pressed in, the fallback feature is enabled. The fallback speed is determined
by the position of the fallback speed switch (FS).</P>
<H4>Fallback Speed (FS)</H4>
<P>This switch selects one of two possible fallback speeds (7200 or 4800 b/s) and is
functional only if fallback is enabled (FB pushed in.) When the FS switch is out,
7200 b/s is selected, while when in, 4800 b/s is selected.</P>
<H4>Send Data (SD)</H4>
<P>When on, this LED indicates that the integral modem is transmitting data.</P>
<H4>Receive Data (RD)</H4>
<P>When this LED is lit, the integral modem is receiving data.</P>
<H4>Carrier Detect (CD)</H4>
<P>When on, this indicates that an audio carrier from a remote station is present.</P>
<H4>Clear to Send (CS)</H4>
<P>When on, this LED indicates that the integral modem is ready to transmit data.</P>
<H4>Request to Send (RS)</H4>
<P>When on, this indicator tells you that the DFM is requesting transmission.</P>
<H4>Signal Quality (SQ)</H4>
<P>When blinking, the LED indicates that the quality of the telephone line is marginal.
When the LED is on, it indicates that the quality of the line is poor.</P>
<H4>Fallback (FB)</H4>
<P>When on, this indicator means that the integral modem is in fallback mode due to a
high level of errors at the higher speed. Fallback speed is determined by switch FS.</P>
<H4>Test Mode (TM)</H4>
<P>When the light is on, the integral modem is in the test mode. More information
about operator features and programming information can be found in the <CITE>DFM
Series Intelligent Communications Processor User Guide</CITE>.</P>
<H3>Maintenance</H3>
<P>You can verify the integrity of individual DFM units by using the System Automatic
Self-Test. This determines the condition of hardware components and elements,
which are not properly a part of a channel or link.</P>
<P>Each DFM automatically runs through a self-test at power on. This test checks
the hardware components to ensure that the system is operational. A restart command
from the supervisory command sequence effectively duplicates a power on
without going through the password sequence.</P>
<P>A successful power on or restart is indicated by the Device Ready (DR) LED.
When the LED comes on, it indicates that self-test has passed. If self-test fails, the
failure is reported by front panel LEDs.</P>
