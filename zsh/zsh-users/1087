:	Am I doing something wrong? I notice OSTYPE is mostly correct,
:	however, sometimes I get slight discrepancies like:
:1009 % echo $OSTYPE
:sunos4.1.3
:[ thigpen@k2 (8:55AM) ~  ]
:1010 % uname -a 
:SunOS k2.ccs.neu.edu 4.1.4 1 sun4m unknown
:	It seems that major types are used not revisions/updates/minor-types.
:	I'd rather use and depend on builtins like OSTYPE (or something
:	similar) rather than run something else.

OSTYPE is defined at zsh compile time.  Running `uname' will normally 
query your OS.  They serve different purposes.
