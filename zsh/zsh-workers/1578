run_init_scripts() is called before loop(1) which can mess up alloc_stackp.
Also debug tests should notice even seemingly impossible bugs.  Signal
traps can always cause surprises.  E.g. in execcmd() _very_ weird things
happened before introducing execsave()/execrestore() in dotrap().  For
example variables suddenly changed between two instructions.  Of course
this can still happen any time a global or static variable is used but now
it does not happen as often as before.
