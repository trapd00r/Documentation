OK, that quotes the spaces, but I don't get completion after that.
For example, if I have the file as above, and another one 
"readme - yarrow.txt", then I get:

        % less readme\ -\ 
                          ^ cursor here

as I'd expect, but <TAB> after that just beeps (I'd expect to be shown
the possible completions).  And typing an extra "c" or "y" (to
disambiguate) doesn't help: <TAB> just beeps.

(If "readme - corrections.txt" is the only such file, then <TAB>
correctly completes the whole thing.)
