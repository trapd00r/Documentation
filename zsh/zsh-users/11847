 "Why isn't $PATH expanded internally?" (Sep 16, 10:41pm)

} into $PATH will not work as expected.

$PATH is just a symbolic name for a string in the process environment.
This environment is passed along verbatim to every program forked by
the shell; the PATH value is not merely used internally for searches
by the shell itself.

Incidentally ~/foo and $HOME/foo *are* normally expanded "on load" when
included in a PATH=.... assigment.  If it's not working for you, it is
most likely because of quoting that you've applied to the value.
