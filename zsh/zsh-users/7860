Yes, I do use smart-insert-last-word, sorry for the confusion. I have now
added your LBUFFER+='' trick to the start of this function, and so far it
seems to be working well. I'll report back if I find any problems.

As for the long-time solution, I suppose others are better fit than me to
tackle this.

Thank you for your help, Bart!
