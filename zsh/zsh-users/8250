If you have zsh 4.2.x, try the url-quote-magic widget that's included in
the Functions/Zle directory in the distribution.  Load it like this:

  autoload -U url-quote-magic
  zle -N self-insert url-quote-magic

Then trick it into treating any hostname as a URL scheme when the command 
name is "scp", by doing this (note placement of single/double quotes):

  zstyle -e :urlglobber url-other-schema \
    '[[ $words[1] == scp ]] && reply=("*") || reply=(http https ftp)'

(Read the comments in the function file for an explanation of why the 
context is ":urlglobber", if you care.)

Then just type your scp command and watch what happens.
