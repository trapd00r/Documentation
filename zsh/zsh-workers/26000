yep.

It is not different from the vi editor. If you have the string "Hello
there" in vi, and the cursor is on the t in there and you enter insert
mode, then you cannot backspace further left than that. Maybe you are
used to vim where the default in many distros (probably) is to allow
backspacing past this point. You can ":set compatible" to get the
original vi behaviour.
