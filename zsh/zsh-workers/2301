A friend who is not on the mailing lists reports that, under IRIX 6 only,
autocd doesn't work for the directory ".." (parent directory) unless you
use something like "./.." or "../".  He says it works using just ".." in
Linux 2.0 and in SunOS, same version of zsh; but not in IRIX 6, where it
produces "command not found".

I don't have access to an IRIX machine any longer, so I can't try this.
Has anyone else seen anything like it?  Any ideas?
