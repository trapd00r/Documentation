}               Each optarg following an optspec must take one of the  following

} 
} (Typically, it never actually defines what it means by an "optarg", but it
} obviously means everything from the first colon onwards.)

Strange, I was sure it used to at least reference that in the syntax
synopsis.  I.e., that it used to say

    optspec
    optspec:optarg

where now it says

    optspec
    optspec:...

However, the colon is considered part of the optarg, and it doesn't look
very nice to write

    optspec
    optspecoptarg

so this probably got edited a long time ago and the lost forward reference
was just never fixed.
