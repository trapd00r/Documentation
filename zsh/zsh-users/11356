No the question was to get information about your specific installation and usage.

Yes it was.

No one said you have to accept anything.  If you have the tools and environment you need fine.

I agree.  Do you also require them all to use zsh, awk, etc?  I expect not.
But, if you need them for remote execution its understandable.

That sounds like a good setup.

Yes PuTTy is a good.
I use it as well for my cygwin terminal, rather than the MS DOS command window.

I don't know, never tried it, but you should be able to use cygwin to build zsh without cygwin dll dependencies, by using the MS API or with it and Mingw.
