Yes, thanks, there's yet another infuriating special case of the sort
that makes me wish I'd picked an easier project.

That's the third change here; the stuff with intrap is because it
doesn't detect that it's already inside a trap (and hence should skip
debugging) until it gets into dotrapargs(), and in this case it seems
neater not to go to the trouble.  This will be even more sensible when I
get around to regenerating the line to be debugged at this point.
