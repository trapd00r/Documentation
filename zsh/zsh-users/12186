They're certainly allowed, but our mail filter at work dumps mail with
programmatic attachments (which, unfortunately, tends to includes plain
text if it's identifiable as a script) to a website where I have to
extract the scripts by hand.  (Doing so with shell scripts is pointless but
it's designed to satisfy administrators rather than engineers.)  So I
deliberately tend to avoid using them myself.  However, there's no real
accounting for corporate mail systems, and I have no such problem at
home, so I shouldn't put too much weight on it.
