Hi,

I have compiled zsh 3.0.0 under SCO OpenServer 5.02, but with zsh as
my login shell I get always "Termcap entry too long". Same error if I
change termbuf[2048] in init.c to a higher value. I can fix it with
-lcurses but I prefer -ltermcap.

Another question: Is there a reason why the name of the subdirectories
have the first letter in upper case eg. Src, Etc, Doc.

Thanks in advance
/Joachim
