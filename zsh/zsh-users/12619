As I said: no rsync, no ssh on the Internet server, only http and ftp.

Can't be done when there is no CVS or SVN at the side where you want 
to upload.

I figured out that sitecopy[1] is probably the best choice:

1. I symlink all the files I want to synchronize into an empty 
directory ("ln -s ~/.zshrc ~/.sitecopy/sync/.zshrc"), then

2. I sync this directory to the WebDAV server ("sitecopy -u mysite")

3. Sync from the WebDAV server on the remote side into 
~/.sitecopy/sync: "sitecopy -f mysite && sitecopy -s mysite"
(can't use ~ (the real target) because sitecopy would delete all the 
other files in ~)

4. and then rsync all the files from ~/.sitecopy/sync to ~

Done
