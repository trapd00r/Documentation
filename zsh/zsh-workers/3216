There will be a zsh-3.0.4 release within a few days since zsh-3.0.3 has a
quite annoying bug, as it forgets terminal setting the first time a
background job finishes while zle is active unless ttyctl -f is not used.
But you can install zsh-3.0.3 and put ttyctl -f into your .zshrc and you'll
not notice anything wrong and you can even help by reporting still
undiscovered bugs before 3.0.4 is out.
