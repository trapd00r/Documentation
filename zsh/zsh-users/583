I've been a happy user of Peter Stephenson's mh completion commands, but
I've noticed a problem that I hoped someone might know the solution to.
When I do a:

folder +work/

and then hit <tab>, all I get is "folder +work//", and any subsequent
<tab>'s just add slashes.  Nothing is listed below either.

Suggestions?
