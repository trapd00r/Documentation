There's a perfectly good fake style for adding matches to a particular
context. The following would work for me but it seemed a useful thing to
do out of the box:
  zstyle ':completion:*:user(mod|add):option-s-1:*' fake /bin/false

Where we have styles like hosts and users, they replace matches instead
of adding to them.
