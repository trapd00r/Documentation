What's special about Git is that new options are added and various
tweaks done _very_ often. The Zsh Git completion, apart from being
buggy/unfinished (some of the problems were fixed recently), is also
out of sync, because nobody really follows Git development and updates
it accordingly.

IMO having _git inside the Git tree is a good idea. The Bash completion
is also maintained together with Git, by the Git developers, and I
wouldn't be surprised if it were much better than the Zsh one (rather,
I'd be surprised if it weren't ;-).)

The only problem I see is whether there are really enough Zsh users
following Git development and at the same time able and willing to
maintain the completion script.
