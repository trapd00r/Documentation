Subject: More brokenness of here-docs in `functions' output
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Consider:

threedocs() {
  cat <<EOF
this is $path
EOF
  cat <<\EOF
this is $path
EOF
  cat <<-EOF
	this is $path
	EOF
}

This function executes correctly, printing:

this is /home/schaefer/bin /usr/local/bin etc. etc.
this is $path
this is /home/schaefer/bin /usr/local/bin etc. etc.

But look at the output of `functions threedocs':

threedocs () {
        cat <<< 'this is $path'
        cat <<< 'this is $path'
        cat <<< 'this is $path'
}

Oops.
