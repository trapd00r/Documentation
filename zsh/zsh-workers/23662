Subject to the usual cronjob delays and bugs in tailor that lose most of
the tags and branches,

http://git.debian.org/?p=private/schizo/tailor/zsh-cvs/.git

In a few days, I'll probably kill the Arch repo mentioned in 19776,
since tla development is proceeding along somewhere between coma and
dead.

This is not an endorsement of git.
