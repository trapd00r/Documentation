Yes but you can't "read output of process" without forking this =
process. The
only case when $(...) is not forked is $(<file-name) which is replaced =
by
the content of file-name.

OTOH you are going to do it just once on startup, are not you? In which =
case
fork or not fork is irrelevant here.=20
