You're not actually supposed to be able to use compiled files with
different versions of the shell.  There is a version number built in,
but unless the version number of the shell in the archive was
incremented in between (which is only done manually when I make a
release) this doesn't alert the shell to differences.

Most of the time this doesn't matter but if there is a change in parsing it
can make a difference.
