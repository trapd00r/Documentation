It doesn't look like I'm going to be able to jump through enough hoops
to be able to reproduce the problem in this form.

Is this only on the zsh-4_2-patches branch?  Can you reproduce it by
completing with the same list of files recreated locally?  From the line
number, it looks like the error is probably that the variable "g" is
NULL, hence mgtab[ml2 * columns * mc2] is NULL?
