CVS is feeling a little better today.  If you already have a zsh
checkout, edit the main CVS/Root file and add a "zsh." prefix in
front of the cvs.sourceforge.net hostname, like this:

:ext:YOUR_USERNAME@zsh.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/zsh

or (so I have read) this:

:pserver:anonymous@zsh.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/zsh

Then, copy the updated file into all the other CVS dirs:

for root in **/CVS; cp -p CVS/Root $root

After that, you should be able to access zsh's cvs again.
