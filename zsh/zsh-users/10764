Hi JR,

 me again...

 I inserted 

   rm -rf /tmp/mc-4.6.1i*(/)

 into my cleanup-script for /tmp and executed it _twice_.

 First kills the directory, second run gives me:

      solfire:/home/mccramer>~/bin/cleantmp
	  /home/mccramer/bin/cleantmp:20: no matches found: /tmp/mc-4.6.1i*(/)

 Can I supress the warning also (other "rm -f"'s, which carry the (N)
 also does not print a warning when not found.)

 I tried the following:
 I mkdir a directory mc-4.6.1A and touch mc-4.6.1B then I did a 
 rm -rf /tmp/mc-4.6.1*(/N) from within a script. BOTH entries were
 removed. Only the directory should be removed.

 What I am confusing here so much ?

 Thank you very much in advance for any help !
