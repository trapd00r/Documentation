} Whew. The first behavior is the correct one, since the completion code 
} should take the `(I*)' as the prefix of the string to complete and as
} long as you don't have a file with a name starting with this, nothing
} should be matched.

But I *DO* have a file beginning with "I" -- $PWD is the zsh source root,
so the INSTALL file is there.  (I*) apparently isn't a glob pattern:

zagzig% echo (I*)    
zsh: no matches found: (I*)
zagzig% echo (I*|)
INSTALL

So if your patch somehow makes (I*) complete, something weird is going on.
