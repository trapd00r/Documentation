Zsh is installed as one of the main shells here in this institute, and
I believe in DESY Hamburg.  I have an office in the computer center
here, and I'm known to be the local zsh expert, so I'd probably hear
if something was going wrong (though I'm not officially involved with
the UNIX systems).  So far the only complaint I got was about `read
-k' not working from a script, which I think has since been fixed.
That seems to be quite a lot of satisfied users.
