:(Geoff, I've forgotten again how to write a URL with the article number
:embedded in it for the search CGI.  Could you perhaps put that info on the
:archive pages somewhere?)

Will do.  Or if you don't mind reading HTML source, go through 
    http://www.zsh.org/mla/
and see the lines with
    <FORM METHOD=POST ACTION="/cgi-bin/mla/redirect">
    <INPUT TYPE=TEXT NAME=WORKERNUMBER VALUE="" SIZE=8>
then work out it's
    http://www.zsh.org/cgi-bin/mla/redirect?WORKERNUMBER=4589
(similarly for users with USERNUMBER)  Oh, {user,worker}number is 
case insensitive.

(Of course, that won't work with articles since the list moved to
 sunsite.auc.dk because they're not archived yet.)
