I'm really surprized no one else has answered this yet ...

zstyle '*:my-accounts' users-hosts tractrix:kom.auc.dk ...

where ... are more strings of the form user:host, will set up zsh's idea
of the accounts that are "you".  These get used for ssh, rsh, and several
other commands that take user, host, or user@host arguments.

You can be more specific if you want:

zstyle '*:ssh:*:my-accounts' users-hosts tractrix:kom.auc.dk ...
zstyle '*:rsh:*:my-accounts' users-hosts alboege:fictitious.com ...

There are also styles that are lists of hosts, users, other-accounts, etc.,
but you can cover most of the cases for ssh with just this one.
