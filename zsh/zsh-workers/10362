} Or maybe make `-a' the opposite of `-c'? I.e. `-c' says that currently 
} defined (not marked for autoloading) functions are to be written and
} `-a' says functions marked for autoloading are to be written. We could 
} then say `...to be written without signalling an error', so that `-ca' 
} allows to mix both

That would be fine.  (Note, I'm not "everyone" ...)

} And then we can add a description of the _cvs problem in the manual,
} so that people know why using this might be a problem.

That would be good, too.
