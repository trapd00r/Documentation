I'm getting this:

        libsocket.so.1 =>        /usr/lib/libsocket.so.1
        libdl.so.1 =>    /usr/lib/libdl.so.1
        libnsl.so.1 =>   /usr/lib/libnsl.so.1
        libcurses.so.1 =>        /usr/lib/libcurses.so.1
        libm.so.1 =>     /usr/lib/libm.so.1
        libc.so.1 =>     /usr/lib/libc.so.1
        libmp.so.2 =>    /usr/lib/libmp.so.2
        /usr/platform/SUNW,Sun-Fire-280R/lib/libc_psr.so.1

   unused object=/usr/lib/libsocket.so.1

Mostly that doesn't look unreasonable.

Are you referring to the fact that all system libraries needed in zsh
and its modules are linked into the main shell and all modules?  That's
a fairly cosmetic problem requiring a rewrite of the build system that's
likely to be 1,798,109,308th in my global list of things to worry about.
