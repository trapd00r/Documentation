I updated the NEWS file and gave it a bit of a tidy.  The diff didn't
seem particularly useful but the latest version is here:

http://zsh.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/zsh/zsh/NEWS?revision=HEAD&view=markup

(omit "&view=markup" to download rather than view).

I need to issue a new version of the shell soon.  I've been hoping
there'll be some leads on Vincent's crashes but I don't think we've got
anything reproducible yet and I'm not sure these are new anyway.
