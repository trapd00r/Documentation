While playing about with zmodload I noted that a failed zmodload
doesn't flag an error, so you can use it as a test for module
availability.  I've interpreted this as a feature and documented it.

I've changed some zerr()'s that were saving errflag to zwarn()'s that
don't need to.  I think this is just because we didn't always have the
complete set of interfaces.
