Aha.  Confusion is a wonderful thing.  Yes, as far as internal management
of names goes that would be fine.  It's explicitly separate from argzero
anyway, because of the [no]functionargzero bodge, and I've taken to using
`print -P %N' to get function names in messages, so your patch would seem
to be a sensible way forward.
