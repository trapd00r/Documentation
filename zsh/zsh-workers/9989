Subject: The `zle' command and traps
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Here's an odd tidbit ... `zle' from a trap handler can actually affect the
line editor, if and only if the signal happens to arrive while ZLE is
active.  E.g. try

	TMOUT=2 ; TRAPALRM() { zle -R "Hi there, I'm a trap." }

Of course if the signal arrives when ZLE is not active, this generates an
ugly warning message.
