[...]

On most system, the execve() of a script that doesn't have a #!
line will return with ENOEXEC. In which case, it will be zsh
that will run /bin/sh (if it doesn't find a NUL character in the
first 64 bytes of the file).

That's also what the exec*p() type libc functions do, except that
those may not run /bin/sh but whichever shell is required by the
standard they implement and don't search for NUL bytes.

Maybe in sh emulation, zsh could call itself in sh emulation in
that case?
