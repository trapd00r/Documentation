Hi.

Have a look at this short session:
> $ mkdir 'some(dir'
> $ cd some<TAB>
> $ cd some\(dir
> cd:5: bad pattern: some(dir

Obviously, completion fails to escape the '(' properly ("cd some\\\(dir"=20
works fine). Of course in this example "setopt NO_bad_pattern" would=20
help, but that's a workaround at best.
I'm now officially giving up on finding where that escaping takes place=20
in zsh, because at 2:38 I thing I deserve some sleep. If anyone could=20
kindly point me to the right place I will gladly provide a patch.=20
Tomorrow.


Good night,
felix
