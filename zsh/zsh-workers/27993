I think you're right that users should be notified
of all module load failures, including those
caused by autoloaded features.

However, "unknown parameter" is a very
misleading and frustrating error message,
especially when the construct ${+NAME}
asks to simply return 0 for unknown parameters.

Emacs has a similar feature, and a more
informative error message, of the form

    error ("Autoloading failed to define function %s",

So please change the zsh error to something like

"Autoloading of module %s failed to define parameter %s"
