Subject: child PID in TRAPCHLD?
Date: Thu, 11 Dec 2008 01:32:30 -0500

Hello,

I'm trying to catch the termination of background commands.   Using
TRAPCHLD seems sensible, but I can't see a way to identify the PID (or
job id) of the command that has ended.  Am I missing something?  If not,
perhaps zsh could be enhanced to set $! to that PID locally inside the
TRAPCHLD handler?

Rgds

Anthony
