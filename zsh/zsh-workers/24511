While updating Mandriva RPM for 4.3.5 it caught my attention that SPEC stat=
es=20
License: GPL. Now, that is wrong as far as I can tell; Zsh is not under GPL=
=20
license and it IIRC several times it was mentioned on zsh-workers that Zsh =
won't=20
be put under GPL (I may be wrong here).

This poses several questions.

If we need License tag in RPM - how should it be called? Zsh comes with LIC=
ENSE=20
file but that is not anything from "commonly used" license.

Possibly more question to zsh-workers - should I remove License: GPL from=20
Mandriva RPM?

To cooker - if we cannot put any "common" open source license tag in zsh RP=
M -=20
is it allowed to be distributed via main repository?
