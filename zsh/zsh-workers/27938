I did, but this doc isn't really helpful - it's just talking about abstract=
s without further
explaining what this are. The example.c only defines the builtins on start =
and never
changes them.=20

I want to add new ones per runtime.I am currently trying to maintain a seco=
nd list=20
and call addbuiltin() when I need to add one.
