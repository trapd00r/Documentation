zsh v. 2.6-beta13 on HP-UX A.09.01
(not reproducible on Solaris or SunOS)

With 'bindkey -v',
if I have

123456789012345678 012345 7

trying to do 'dw' anywhere on the second word deletes the whole line
instead of the word.
For the bug to happen, the length of the first and second words matter
(exactly as above), and there must be a space after the second word.
Haven't (yet) found another word configuration where that happens.

Pretty weird, huh?
