I very much agree with Bart on these points.

If we are going to have default /etc/z* files in a generated rpm package
they should be as minimal as possible. We should stress the point to
people installing zsh that they should only put things in global setup
files that really should be in them. My definition of that is only
things which are necessary for the specifics of the local setup so only
adding a few things to the PATH and setting any variables necessary for
programs to run.

Maybe a user can override it but it isn't necessarily obvious whether
the significant value for these variables is the first or last value
they get. I never trust these things until I've checked them out. I also
sometimes like to know that I have a clean zsh when I run it as a
different user or whatever.

If we want to provide examples of clever zsh startup files which enable
all the bells and whistles, I think it is much better to put them on the
web page where they can clearly be labeled as what they are. Anything in
the distribution is likely to be taken as something which is supposed to
be installed in /etc.
