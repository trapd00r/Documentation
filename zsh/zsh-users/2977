} That sounded like a good idea until I tried it out. xterms scrolled back

You can turn that off with a resource.

XTerm*scrollTtyOutput: false

} and often the time is not there because I'm a obsessive clearer
} of my screen.

That must have something to do with trying to see through it.

} >PS1="%{"$'\e7\e[1A\e[1B\e[1;1H'%E$'\e[1;72H'"%D{%I:%M:%S}"$'\e8'"%}%m%# "
}

Oops, I transcribed it wrong.  Move the \e7 to after the \e[1B and it
should work.
