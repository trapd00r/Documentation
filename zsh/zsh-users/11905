Strange, since I just verified the option is working.  Let's check

- If you do this in an interactive shell and exit, zsh prints
  "zsh: warning: 1 jobs SIGHUPed"?
- This still happens if you do "setopt nohup" on the command line
  before exiting?

If both are the case, then something is very strange.
