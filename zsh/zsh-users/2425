From: Peter Stephenson <pws@ibmth.df.unipi.it>

I have uploaded a test version of the next zsh beta release, 3.1.6-test-1,
to ftp.zsh.org, from where it should propagate to the mirror sites (see
end).  The file is in the testing subdirectory,
testing/zsh-3.1.6-test-1.tar.gz . Manual pages are included, but no texinfo
etc.

-rw-r--r--  1 mason  zsh  1251180 Jul 13 00:57 zsh-3.1.6-test-1.tar.gz

I'm posting this to zsh-users, since after months of development versions
there may be people who want to try this out before 3.1.6 proper; the notes
below are a very brief guide of what awaits you in upgrading from 3.1.5
(though a full upgrade should await 3.1.6 proper).

Much of the new code is fairly well tested, so my main interest now is to
sort out compilation problems for systems we may not have tried.  In
particular, it would be helpful if anyone compiling this (including regular
zsh-workers) could check against the notes for their configuration in
Etc/MACHINES, and drop a note to zsh-workers@sunsite.auc.dk about anything
different, i.e. successful compilations on configurations not mentioned at
all, or problems not mentioned for configurations which are supposed to
work, or problems which seem to have been exaggerated --- don't assume we
know anything machine-specific which isn't in Etc/MACHINES.

New features are listed in Etc/NEWS.  The most important change is a new
system for completion based on shell functions; see the zshcompsys manual
pages for the ready-to-use system.  Functions will now be installed by
`make install' and fpath set to find these by default (though they are not
autoloaded by default).  The old completion system is still supposed to
work, and has been less tested recently, so please do report problems with
this.

Note also that dynamic loading is now enabled by default, so (unless it is
not supported on your system, or you use --disable-dynamic) you will need
to make sure the libraries are installed properly by making sure configure
has a sensible --prefix or --exec-prefix.  Dynamic loading should now work
on AIX 3 and HPUX 10; again, please report limitations not yet mentioned in
Etc/MACHINES.  Other configuration changes are supposed to be transparent.


Zsh is available from the following anonymous FTP sites.  These mirror
sites are kept frequently up to date.  The sites marked with (G)
may be mirroring ftp.math.gatech.edu instead of the primary site.
The sites marked with (H) may be mirroring ftp.cs.elte.hu
instead of the primary site.

[Some of these appear to be out of date, e.g. ftp.sterling.com.  I'd be
glad to hear of any experiences here, too.]
