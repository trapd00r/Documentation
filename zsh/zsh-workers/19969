Perhaps I should add:
`setopt promptsubst' does affect the _right_ prompt which is
not set by `prompt redhat' nor with `prompt suse'.
Plus:
[knoppix@NomenEstOmen ~]\$
                        ^ on purpose?

A friend of mine told me that the redhat-defaultprompt of
_bash_ does change when in the home-directory of the user.
it doesn't show the ~ then but shows the name of the user.
I cannot verify that one using debian here.
