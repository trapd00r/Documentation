The effect of this is going to be that "zle -I" has no effect when called
from completion widgets, where previously it could.  Is that really the
intent?

I'd think you wanted something more like:

  if (zleactive) {
      if (!trashedzle)
          trashzle();
      return zle_usable()? 0 : 1;
  }

(Though perhaps not precisely that either.)
