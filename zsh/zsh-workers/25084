} Any ideas what might be going on? Race condition?

What version of the shell are we dealing with here?  Does it have PWS's
patch from users/12815?  I've been a little worried that that is too
simple.  On the other hand, if it does not have users/12815, it's
possible that zsh is actually waiting for some other job that doesn't
exist any more, and interrupting vlc is a red herring.

I note from the ps output that PIDs have rolled over since the shell
was started, which is exactly the case where that patch would come
into play.
