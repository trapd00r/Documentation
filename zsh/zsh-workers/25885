Sorry for ambiguous. I'm talking about both ones. Replacing _path_files solves
both '()Ą'/[TAB] and Ą/[TAB] problems.

Thanks! The problem gone after "zsh -f; autoload -U compinit; compinit".

The directory 'Ą' is exactly 0xc4 0x84.

  % ls
  Ą
  % ls | hexdump -C
  00000000  c4 84 0a                                          |...|


I removed and reconstructed ~/.zshrc to find out what settings in my ~/.zshrc
break the completion.

The completion Ą/[TAB] works fine with the following .zshrc.
% cat ~/.zshrc
# Lines configured by zsh-newuser-install
HISTFILE=~/.histfile
HISTSIZE=1000
SAVEHIST=1000
bindkey -e
# End of lines configured by zsh-newuser-install
# The following lines were added by compinstall
zstyle :compinstall filename '/home/qw/.zshrc'

autoload -Uz compinit
compinit
# End of lines added by compinstall

However, if I run `compinstall` and enable "Case-insensitive completion
(lowercase matches uppercase)" from "2. Matching control" menu, the completion
Ą/[TAB] stop to working.
I see the following line were added to ~/.zshrc.

  zstyle ':completion:*' matcher-list 'm:{[:lower:]}={[:upper:]}'

After removing the above line, the completion Ą/[TAB] works again.
