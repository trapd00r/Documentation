I built it at home and I didn't have to search too hard for the right rpms.  I
didn't build 2.4.2 at work, but the person who did says the same.

However he has not been able to build 2.4.3, the main problem being the need
for a later version of the compiler, and the lack of a corresponding rpm for
rh6.2.  So can't really comment on the modules, though it is in general
getting pretty hard to keep up to date on rh6.2.  I'll probably give up soon
and install rh7.1.

Yes that fixed it.

I'm a bit surprised to be the only one who reported the problem.
