The netcat completion is not distributed with zsh 4.0.4 (or any 4.0.x)
precisely because of the nedit name clash. 

So you must have a netcat completion from somewhere else and installed
somewhere in your $fpath.

Find the netcat completion and remove it. $^fpath/$_comps[nc](N) should
find it for you.
