Subject: Cant fg a suspended su (4.1.0-dev-7)

From: Peter Whaite <peta@cortexmachina.com>

I've noticed that I cannot resume a suspened su session lately (It
happened in 4.1.0-dev-6 as well). 

       aragorn% /bin/su peta
       Password: 
       aragorn% echo $ZSH_VERSION
       4.1.0-dev-7
       aragorn% suspend
       zsh: suspended (signal)  /bin/su peta
       aragorn% fg %1
       [1]  + continued  /bin/su peta
       zsh: suspended (signal)  /bin/su peta

There is approximately a 1 second pause between the contined and the
suspended messages.  

Any idea why the su command re-suspends after the continue?
