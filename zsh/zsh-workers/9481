Subject: Strange behavior creating functions
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

I wanted to create a function with a unique name, so I tried this:

function foo$$ () { echo $0 }

This works as expected in 3.0.7, creating a function named foo31679 (or
whatever the PID is).  Same for 3.1.6-dev-14.

However, in 3.1.6-dev-16 (the first "foo" is an autoloaded function I use
for testing):

zagzig[60] functions -m foo\*
foo () {
        # undefined
        builtin autoload -X
}
foo () {
        echo $0
}
zagzig[61] zmodload parameter; print -l ${functions[(I)foo*]}
foo
foo$$
zagzig[62] foo$$
zsh: command not found: foo29406
zagzig[63] 'foo$$'
zsh: command not found: foo$$
