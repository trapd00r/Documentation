It appears that the changes to bin_read in beta21 have introduced a
bug.  Trailing non-whitespace IFS characters on the input line are
appended to the last parameter being set, instead of removed.  This
change has broken a script of mine.  Or does POSIX require this?  sh
matches zsh's previous behaviour.
