Yesterday I was irritated again that rpm completion does not descend
directories if it finds any *.rpm file. Before I had this issue with
gunzip as well.

I know I can configure it. My point is it should be default. Current
behavior looks counter-intuitive to me. Actually I have a feeling it was
differently before.
