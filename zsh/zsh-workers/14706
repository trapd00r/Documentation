Yes, this is a good idea, since we now have two branches currently with the
same version identifier.  I've relabelled the head of zsh-4_0-patches as
4.0.1-dev-0 (just to be extra careful to avoid confusing the stuff in the
archive with a major release; it will become 4.0.2 when we tidy up the
bugs) and the head of the trunk as 4.1.0-dev-0, so the first beta will be
4.1.1.
