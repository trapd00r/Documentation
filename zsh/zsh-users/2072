Ok. great.

unlimit worked, well on Sol24 box anyway.  To finish this off then, I have
a couple last questions :

1 - where is the most appropriate place to put the unlimit call (~/.zshenv
or ~/.zshrc).  I never have been able to figure out what goes where.
Currently, I only specify my path in ~/.zshenv and everything else is done
in ~/.zshrc, is this correct ?

2 - is there any way to determine the amount of resources consumed by zsh
and in what areas ?  (i.e. is it my environment that is causing the stack
space to blow or is it the datasize, etc ???)

Thanks,
greg

I presume you get some kind of error message that leads you to believe
this is a limits problem?

Some versions of Sun operating systems have problems executing processes

was still susceptible, but it's possible.  You don't use `setopt allexport`
in zsh or anything silly like that, do you?

Have you tried the `unlimit` command (note the "n") which with no argument
should increase all limits to their maximum allowed values?
