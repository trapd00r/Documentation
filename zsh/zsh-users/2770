Subject: tostop && TTOU
X-Mailer: Liam [version 0.7]

I'm trying to get TTOU generated in a script, without forcing the user to
stty tostop in the terminal controling shell.


i tried to set stty tostop in the script but that didnt work, so i tried=
 to
set it in the script and then run the rest of the script in a subshell,=
 but
that didnt work either.

if i run stty tostop in the top most shell, then the script gets TTOU.

if i run the script in a subshell (encapsulate the entire shell in ()'s),
then even the above solution fails to work.

Can anyone give me an explaination of how tostop and TTOU interact with
multiple layers of shells?
