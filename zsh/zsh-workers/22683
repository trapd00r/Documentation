Since there seem to be no more comments I've committed the sched changes
in the modified form: print is unchanged and you need to specify "sched
-o" to make the event clear and redraw a zle command line around output.
Maybe there's a better option, but o for output seemed an obvious one.
"sched HH:MM:SS cmd..." is allowed as well.
