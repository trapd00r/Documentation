Deprecated ? but why ? i always thought that the stoneage syntax will be 
deprecated some day!

I think that modern syntax is a simple feature that makes zsh faster to 
  use than any other shell. coming from bash, i was very impressed to write

for f ( *.jpg ) mv $f $f:r.jpeg

instead of

for f in *.jpg; do mv $f $f:r.jpeg; done

I'm currious about how many of us are using the deprecated syntax. So 
curious that i wrote a poll page to know about it

please vote!
