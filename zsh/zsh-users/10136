} But how do you know how much line prefix to type in order to get a
} correct match, and how do you efficiently deal with multiple history
} lines with the same long prefix?

One can type alt-p repeatedly to continue searching, just as with ctrl-r.
If necessary, one can type the binding for end-of-buffer-or-history to
get back to the original pattern, add more text, and then alt-p again.

I'm not necessarily advocating this over incremental search, but you
asked, so ...
