Thanks for the tips, Thomas (or should I say Captain? :)  Two other
people have replied so far, and I'm getting a great list of tips.

With all I've been learning, I may become an all-day user too...

Actually, shell techniques are spread through pretty much the whole
book.  We don't concentrate any shell into just one chapter... though
some chapters tend to have more shell-related stuff.  Thanks for the
comment, though.

No problem.  It's really short -- basically just your name and address,
plus a URL and website description if you refer me to something online.

Thanks again, and please keep those emails coming, all!
