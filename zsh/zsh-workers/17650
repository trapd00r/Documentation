Subject: config.modules glitch in configure or make dependencies
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

I just noticed that my last several recompiles have failed to generate a
config.modules line for zsh/net/socket.  I had to remove config.modules
and re-run config.status before it showed up.
