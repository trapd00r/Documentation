Hmm.  When I try to use that set of "ps" arguments, I get no completions
at all.  Some investigation reveals that "ps" is giving

ERROR: TTY could not be found.

However, assuming that it's working for you ...

} The problem is that the completion frameworks show the process list

You need to edit the _pids function and change the line

 _wanted processes expl 'process ID' compadd "$@" "$desc[@]" "$all[@]" -a pids && ret=0

To

 _wanted -V processes expl 'process ID' compadd "$@" "$desc[@]" "$all[@]" -a pids && ret=0

Bonus points for making use of the "sort" style and submitting a patch ...
