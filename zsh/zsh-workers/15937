You should get 4.1.0-dev-2 which is out now. I'm not sure whether the
change is in dev-1 (I struggled to find the ChangeLog entry) but most of
the changes to completion functions to make use of it are definitely
after dev-1.

Once you've got dev-2, you shouldn't need to do anything special to
enable the feature. Just try completing GNU grep or ls options (for
example) to see that it is working.
