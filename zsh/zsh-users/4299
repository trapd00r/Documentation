Hello everyone-

I'm tired of using my close-window shortcut to zap shells
that still owned running programs, so I'd like my zsh prompt
to indicate that somehow. I can't figure out how to do anything
programmatically with the 'jobs' command (such as "jobs | wc -l"),
so I'm lost as to how to do my prompt trick.

TIA for any help

-Drew
