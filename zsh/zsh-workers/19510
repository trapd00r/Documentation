That doesn't help. configure has already decided that it needs to link
against the pcre library because there is nothing in configure.ac which
links the pcre setup to having the pcre module.

Also, with a solution like that you suggest, people packaging for
Linux distributions are possibly going to enable the pcre module. Since
self-building zsh tends to result in an install in /usr/local, it is
going to be mostly packaged copies of zsh that people use before /usr
is mounted. We can always branch for 4.2.0 if we want to make changes
specific to it.
