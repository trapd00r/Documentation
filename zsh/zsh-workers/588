It's just my week to trip over ghosts, I guess.

Since it works in csh, I always assumed this was an officially
sanctioned "good thing".  I'd prefer that zsh follow csh on this,
but it's not worth a significant effort, IMO.

Hmm, I was about to ask what I could do instead - presto - expansion
almost works:

% echo aacd
aacd
^aa^ab<TAB>
results in:
echo ab cd

If we could get rid of that extra space, that would be cool!
