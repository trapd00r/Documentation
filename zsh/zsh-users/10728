That example does evalute the prompt each time it's printed; you just
can't tell.  Try with a command that changes its output:

zsh% PS1='$(date)-%% ' ; setopt promptsubst
Sun Sep 17 12:06:02 CDT 2006-% <press enter>
Sun Sep 17 12:06:33 CDT 2006-% <press enter>
Sun Sep 17 12:06:34 CDT 2006-% 

Of course in this example you'd be better off using zsh's builtin
date-printing prompt escapes, but you get the idea.
