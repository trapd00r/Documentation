This could probably be fixed up.  We have special handling for optional
numeric arguments to options, but not for mandatory because it didn't
seem necessary.  Adding that and making both look for the end of the
number would restore compatilibity.

However, I'm not completely sure that's the right way to go, since the
usual convention is that the argument extends to the end of the word;
with the change, we lose sanity checking (although we can still check
there is at least one digit present).
