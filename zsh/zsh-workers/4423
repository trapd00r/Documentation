(One more line of context added for clarity.)

I haven't actually walked through this with a debugger, but it looks to
me as though hn = NULL at that point is going to trigger the call to
hashcmd(cmdarg, pathchecked), which in turn is going to call iscom() a
second time; so you end up stat()ing the directory twice.  Perhaps

 	    if (hn && !isreallycom((Cmdnam)hn))
 		hn = NULL;
 	    else if (!hn && isset(HASHCMDS) && strcmp(cmdarg, "..")) {
            ^^^^
would be better?

Also, what about removing the improperly hashed directory from cmdnamtab
once you've discovered that it isn't a command?  That would (I think) get
any real command with the same name put into the table the next time that
name was used, so that you'll never needlessly stat() again.
