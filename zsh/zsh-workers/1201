Bart wrote that ANSI C guarantees ASCII in the cases we need so that should
not cause any problems.  I do not see where is is assumed that a char has 8
bits othar than buffer sizes.  We do assume that char has at least 8 bits
but that's OK.

Here struct iparam is used for initialisation.  It is used instead of
struct param since initialisation of a union might cause problems.
