"unsetopt MULTIBYTE" is supposed to get you pretty much back to where we
were before if you don't care about multibyte characters.  I'm not aware
of a general solution to the efficiency problem with proper multibyte
handling.

In this particular case, it should be more efficient than before, at
least with a long list to sort, since now the strings are transformed
once each instead of every time two strings are compared.

I haven't done any benchmarking.  At the moment I'm happy if it works.
