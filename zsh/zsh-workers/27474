Subject: Entering zero-width chars in the ^r prompt messes up display
From: Mikael Magnusson <mikachu@gmail.com>
To: zsh workers <zsh-workers@zsh.org>
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

I pasted a filename from a webpage and it had some <200b> in it, so i
did ctrl-r ctrl-shift-200b to delete them quickly, but instead ended
up with weirdness. The same thing happens for combining chars like
<305>. Also notable is that the search seems to fail, while it works
fine for other utf-8 chars, including double-width japanese chars.
