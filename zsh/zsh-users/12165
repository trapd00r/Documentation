You have my condolences. These days I use FreeBSD, Mac OS X
(FeeBSD!?), Ubuntu and Solaris (8 and 10). Count yourself lucky
you're using 10 and that you have access to zsh ;-)

I tend to do things per host (since each of the hosts at work is
so different).

I have this inside my .zshrc:

if [[ -r ${ZDOTDIR}/.zshrc.${HOST%%.*} ]]; then
  source ${ZDOTDIR}/.zshrc.${HOST%%.*}
fi

I then have separate files for each host
($ZDOTDIR/.zshrc.somehost) which do just the things specific to
that host; paths and so on.

If you wanted to do this per OS, you could modify this either
using $OSTYPE or the output of `uname`.

Hope this helps;
