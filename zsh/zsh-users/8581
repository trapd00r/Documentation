In my haste I often end up opening a binary file or a file that doesn't
exist because the completer completes up to the beginning of the
extension (e.g., "vi mytex." when mytex.tex and mytex.pdf exist).

Does anyone have any completion commands set up for vi or emacs that
give preference to plain text files -- those containing source code --
rather than the shorter executable file name?  I've tried a few things
to have .c, .tex, .pl, and so on favored when vi is the executable, but
I'm not too satisfied with my work.

Thanks for any suggestions!
