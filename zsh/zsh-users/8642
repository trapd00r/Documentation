Depending on your version of zsh, it's either the very last section
in "man zshmisc" or about 60% of the way through "man zsh".  The
title of the section is COMPATIBILITY.

       Zsh tries to emulate sh or ksh when it is invoked as sh or
       ksh respectively; more precisely, it looks  at  the  first
       letter  of the name by which it was invoked, excluding any
       initial `r' (assumed to stand for  `restricted'),  and  if
       that  is  `s'  or `k' it will emulate sh or ksh.

In this "the first letter of the name" means the file name with any
leading path removed, i.e. the first letter of the *name* of /bin/sh
is "s" and the first letter of the *path* of /bin/sh is "/".
