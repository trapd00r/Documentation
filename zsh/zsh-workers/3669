Hi there

	The one thing zsh fails at that my tcsh -fan friends get,  
is case-insensitive filename completion.  It's especially useful for  
those of us with repetitive strain injuries (which make the shift  
key harder to use).  It seems a waste to try to write a shell  
function for something so trivial.  Am I missing something, or is  
this a possible keen improvement?
