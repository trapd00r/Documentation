None of the items particularly bother me - we'll still hear about
changes to the terms and could remove our accounts fairly fast if need
be. I don't have any particular objections to moving the zsh hosting
though either.

I'd have reservations about using savannah. When it was new, they only
allowed GPL programs and though I think that has changed, I'd feel that
we'd not be entirely welcome. For cvs, it might be best to first ask
Sunsite Denmark seeing as they already host the mailing lists and web
pages. If not there then the sources.redhat offer is very generous.

I don't care about losing the tracker. The compile farm is useful but
we could leave the project open on sourceforge for anyone who doesn't
mind keeping their sf user account. We should ensure that we have some
way of taking backups of the cvs repository though. I'd also miss the
cvs daily snapshots when I only have access through a web proxy server
(such as now).
