`_telnet' is based on 4.4BSD (NetBSD 1.4).
And most of options are supported by Solaris 7 and Debian.
Also, I know that SunOS 4.1.4 doesn't support options at all.

I agree that `telnet' has many variants and `_telnet' should complete
only valid options of `telnet' if it is possible.

Extracting existence of options from the help text is better way. But
the help text of telnet is not suitable for `_arguments'.

Hm. Maybe `_arguments' should take an argument for a function to parse
a help text.
