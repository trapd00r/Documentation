This turned out to be a bug in "screen" that occurs when screen got
started with LANG=C, and zsh got changed to use LANG=en_US.UTF-8.  Zsh
was actually outputting an escape sequence to move right one position,
but screen was optimizing it into a more efficient output sequence (the
outputting of a single literal character), and screen thought it was in
a different spot than it really was.  Fortunately, starting screen with
the same LANG value that you want to use inside works properly, so it's
not a really big screen bug, but it might trip up someone else who tries
to use zsh with a changed LANG value inside of screen in the future.
