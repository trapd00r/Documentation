} Hrm.  Why doesn't the top-level "make" invoke "make FAQ"?

What I meant by that:

schaefer[539] make FAQ
make: *** No rule to make target `FAQ'.
schaefer[540] make Etc/FAQ
make: Nothing to be done for `../zsh-4.3/Etc/FAQ'.
schaefer[541] (cd Etc
subsh> make FAQ)
cd .. && \
  /bin/sh ./config.status `echo Etc/Makefile | sed 's%^./%%'`
config.status: creating Etc/Makefile
cd ../../zsh-4.3/Etc && yodl2txt FAQ.yo && mv -f FAQ.txt FAQ
Yodl2txt 1.31.18
Yodl is processing a(n) report
Running post-processor /usr/local/bin/yodl2txt-post..

This is differs significantly from, for example, "make info" which
happily descends into Doc/ and builds everything.
