No argument, but the best person to do it is someone who can see
what's wrong with it.  Those of us zsh-workers who spend more time
looking at the source than the documentation are not necessarily in
that position.  Anyone is very welcome to make suggestions as to what
to do.  Even if there are people who would like to do it but don't
feel their English is up to it (and I know the feeling :-/), any
detailed enough suggestions might eventually get acted upon (and
that's a promise :-)).
