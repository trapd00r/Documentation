This doesn't sound like any previously reported problem.  The nearest thing
to shared state between shells is the history mechanism; if you have the
SHARE_HISTORY option set it will try to read history just written by other
shells, but it won't try to execute it.

Do you have any precmd, preexec or chpwd functions, or anything similar, or
some session management layer such as screen?
