So if I read this correctly, the question is:  Which versions of zsh fail
to use NUL between words in the output of "print -N"?

As far as I know, the answer is:  Versions of zsh so old that they don't
support "print -N" in the first place.

I don't know of any circumstances in which that comment in the vim source
is meaningful.  Either "print -N" will fail with "bad option" or it'll
output words separated by NULs.  My only conjecture is that the comment
predates the code earlier in the file, that uses the STYLE_PRINT flag.
