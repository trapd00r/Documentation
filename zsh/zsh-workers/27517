Aha.  I was searching for an actual example of the syntax, similar to
the grammar for complex commands that appears a couple sections later.

} May be, what is missing - explicit statement that if no command name is 
} given, parameter assignments modify current shell.

The manual seems to distinguish between assignments (having no command)
and commands with optional assignments.  I suppose you could say that a
simple command is a sequence of assignments, redirections, and words,
any of which are optional, but that's not how it currently is structured.
