It may be useful, but it's not directly relevant to this discussion.
We're discussing documentation for a Unix shell, so the primary
requirement is that we have online documentation in the form of a Unix
man page.  Info is an unnecessary extra.  HTML is even less useful.
Automated conversion to TeX or LaTeX, however, is of some use, as a
nice printed manual would be a good thing.  (But it is possible to
simply print the man page anyway.)
