Subject: Module completion problem
Date: Wed, 17 May 2000 22:13:16 +0100
From: Peter Stephenson <pws@pwstephenson.fsnet.co.uk>
Message-Id: <E12sB82-0004bJ-00.2000-05-17-22-13-18@mail2.svr.pol.co.uk>

Completing after zmodload currently gives me the message

_path_files:305: unknown file attribute

I don't know why, since the line in question is trying to expand

  ./Zsh/*.s[ol](:r)

which looks quite reasonable to me.  Or should the (:r) already have been
removed in this case?
