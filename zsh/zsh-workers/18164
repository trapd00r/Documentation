Not sure why you didn't find it, maybe the dash:
Home page: 
http://www.caliban.org/bash/index.shtml#completion
Freshmeat project page:  (Contains comments, including some by Oliver and other
Zsh-workers)

The most active version seems to be: ( I didn't look too hard.)  The latest
development on this version is from March 2000.
http://www.csoft.net/~dummy/robert/software/rk.shtml

It is originally from University of Calgary by John J. Darragh and Ian Witten.
They have some papers and a book as part of a PhD.  Though there hasn't been
much development by the original developers, since the early 1990s.
Some links:

http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/~ihw/publications.html

It would be great if someone wanted to make the prediction code a zsh module so
prediction could be native to zsh.
