Nope. It is the problem of exact match. ``/u'' is matched _exactly_ and
hence ``/usr'' is never even tried. I have no ``/SAM/u'', that's why
``/SAM/usr'' is matched. It does not matter, what follows:

itsrm1% ls -F /u
pub/  sni/

Now I ask myself if it's desirable. As my example shows, it could be at
least unexpected  :-) And note, that ``cd /u<TAB>'' correctly lists ``/usr''
as possible match.
