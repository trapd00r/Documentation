Hi,

 I want to dump _all_ settings (even those set ba default) of my zsh.
 I tried

   set
   setopt
   reporter

 but non reports (for example) that MULTIOS is set (I am using the zsh
 as zsh and trioed different things, which only works when MULTIOS is 
 set...)

 How can I display really all settings,env-variables and such ?

 Kind regards and thank you very much in advance for any help !
 Keep hacking!
