If you are using the new completion system (autoload -U compinit;
compinit) then this will work automatically.  The old completion system
didn't have this built in, though you could use compctl to enable it;
you don't say what version of zsh you are using, but if it is 4.x you
are likely to get far better results with the new system.

You might also be interested in the option MAGIC_EQUAL_SUBST; this forces
~'s to be expanded after any ='s.
