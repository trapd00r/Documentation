I believe the limit is sizeof(struct exec) which depends on
sizeof(long): it's usually 8 longs which is 64 bytes on the Alpha but
32 bytes on suns.

The error message is indeed indistinguishable from the one you get if
the file itself doesn't exist.  I was complaining about this a couple
of months ago.  It would be much more consistent for it to return
"exec format error" --- then zsh would start the interpreter itself
and all would be sweetness and light (the code's already there) ---
but in fact it doesn't.
