 [ i apologize for sending this to zsh-workers first - a copy&paste
 mistake ]

 hello,

 i've come across another strange behaviour of zsh. if an error occurs the
 loop is exited and the code below it is executed (see example program).

 example program (test.sh):
 
 ----begin----
 
#!/bin/zsh

nexistentdirs=(aaa bbb ccc)
while :; do
    files=(${nonexistentdirs}/*)
    echo "in the loop"
done
echo "out of loop"

 ----end----

 $ chmod +x test.sh
 $ ./test.sh
 ./test.sh:5: no matches found: ccc/*
 out of loop
 $

 $ mkdir aaa bbb ccc
 $ touch aaa/fileA bbb/fileB ccc/fileC
 $ ./test.sh
 in the loop
 in the loop
 ...
 [and so on]

 i'd expect zsh to simply continue executing commands after the faulty command
but it exits the loop and continues simply below the loop. perhaps another bug?

    thanks for your help,
