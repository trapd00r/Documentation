Well, that rules out all the common system-level tty-setup problems I'm
aware of.

} The problem appears as before.

The only thing I can think of to suggest at this point is that you run
"strace -v zsh +Z" and then examine what's output immediately following
a "setopt zle" command.  I get, among other irrelevant things,

ioctl(10, SNDCTL_TMR_STOP, {c_iflags=0x540, c_oflags=0x5, c_cflags=0xbf,
c_lflags=0x8a31, c_line=0, c_cc[VMIN]=1, c_cc[VTIME]=0,
c_cc="\x03\x00\x08\x15\x04\x00\x01\x00\x11\x13\x00\x00\x12\x00\x17\x00\x00\x00\x73"})
 = 0

} That's what I would like to know, too...

I meant other users of that same machine, though anyone anywhere that is
also having the problem would be good to hear from.
