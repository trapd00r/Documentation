} That's this code from bash's configure.  What do we do, just copy it and
} change BASH to ZSH?

Unless I'm missing something (which is entirely possible), this configure
stuff doesn't do anything but define BASH_LARGE_FILE_SUPPORT.  There must
be some actual C code somewhere in the bash source that tests for that
constant and does *something*.  That something is far more interesting
than the configure part.
