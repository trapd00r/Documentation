Notice the "&&" in there -- if the most-recent-file widget does not yield 
a zero status, accept-line will not be executed.  However, I don't know 
what if any circumstances would cause a nonzero status.

I hadn't noticed before, but in my zsh installation the name of the widget 
is _most_recent_file, [*] not most-recent-file, so there must be something 
else you're doing to create the hyphenated-name version.  Maybe that would 
provide a clue.


[*] And it's bound to ^Xm as well.
