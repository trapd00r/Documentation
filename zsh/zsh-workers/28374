It's a little bit different from that even. Alias expansion is done
literally on the input basically just split on spaces. So even things
like ''mplayer or mplaye\r or mplayer"" will "cancel" out alias
expansion. That the quotes disappear in normal shell parsing is sort
of a lucky coincidence as far as the alias expansion is concerned. :)
