No point sending a full patch at the moment (translation: I'm too lazy
to send a diff without CVS to make it for me), but desthost is being freed
twice in the final `else' of bin_ztcp.  It should probably look like:

	desthost = ztrdup(dargs[0]);

	gai_errno = zsh_getaddrinfo(desthost, destservice, &zthints, &zthost);

	zsfree(destservice);

	if (gai_errno) {
	    /* gai_strerror could be more useful here */
	    zwarnnam(nam, "host/service resolution failure: %s: %d", desthost, gai_errno);
	    zsfree(desthost);
	    return 1;
	}
	zsfree(desthost);

and remove the zsfree(desthost) right at the end of that block.  Unless
it doesn't need ztrdup'ing at all any more.
