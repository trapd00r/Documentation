} I think that's what's happening -- getoutput() has called child_block()
} and will call child_unblock() right before child_suspend()

That's not precisely accurate, BTW.  child_suspend() is what calls [the
equivalent of] child_unblock() internally, right before sigsuspend() [or
the equivalent].  The conceptual flow is the same.
