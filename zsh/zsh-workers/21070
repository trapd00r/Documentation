} _combination doesn't pass on descriptions. It may complete either users
} or hosts and they have different descriptions.

That reminds me ... I'm still using this patch:

diff -r1.1 _combination
91c91,93
<   compadd "$@" -a tmp || { (( $+functions[_$key] )) && "_$key" "$@" }
---
>   local expl
>   _wanted $key expl $key  compadd "$@" -a tmp ||
>       { (( $+functions[_$key] )) && "_$key" "$@" }

This is a crude workaround for some kind of bug in tag-order issue, see
zsh-workers/16598 and surrounding thread.  I have private mail from
Oliver back in August saying he's got a rewritten _combination, but it
doesn't look as if he's ever committed it, and the problem is really
in _arguments anyway?
