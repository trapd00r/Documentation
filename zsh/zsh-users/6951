Zsh has no concept of two-dimensional arrays so you can't split every
element of an array and expect indexing tow work on each element like
that. You would have to have a for loop for each array element.

Alternatively, if it is is the second field you want, you can
probably do:

   ${${pg_tables#*|}%%|*}
