The problem is that user may, quite sensibly, set a global value for
tag-order to something like:

  zstyle ':completion:*' tag-order globbed-files directories all-files ...

With that every filename completion would use all three tags. it will
often be possible to ignore globbed-files (we are talking only about
cases where _files is called without an explicit -g) when there is no
corresponding file-patterns style. But it would make directories be
preferred in every filename completion -- so it would have just a
different kind of side-effect.

Because of that I still prefer the way we do it now, as long as we get 
sorted out how the directories flag should be used. Which mainly
means: always if a file-pattern for globebd-files is set or not.

Bye
 Sven
