Hi
I've imported the .zshenv from my main PC to my Old PC.
I'm now getting the following when I launch a shell.

getent:4: command not found: grep
Ignore insecure directories and continue [ny]?

I think it's to do with compinit and it's something dumb.

$ compaudit
There are insecure directories:
/usr/local/bin
/usr/share/zsh/site-functions
/usr/share/zsh/4.3.4/functions
/usr/local
/usr/share/zsh
/usr/share/zsh/4.3.4

What have I forgot?
