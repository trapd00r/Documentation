He said it was building fine before ZLE_UNICODE_SUPPORT got turned on,
which indicates to me either that wint_t is actually there, or that the
ifdef before the use of the wint_t doesn't succeed:

#if defined(HAVE_WCHAR_H) && defined(HAVE_WCTOMB) && defined(__STDC_ISO_10646__)

If the latter is true, then I can only imagine that the #error directive
didn't work as expected in the multibyte AC_TRY_COMPILE in configure.

No.  Those are there to support the u and U escapes in printf, even when
ZLE_UNICODE_SUPPORT is disabled (this was just recently pointed out to
me).
