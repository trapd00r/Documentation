Subject: zsh x bash: history file
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="ISO-8859-1"

	I've looked almost everywhere and can't find the use of a history file in
ZSH. Is there such thing?

	I also notice that some bash scripts won't run in zsh. There must be fatal
differences in their syntaxes. Do you know if they are documented anywhere?

	Thanks,
