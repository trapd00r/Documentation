Seems like it might be useful.

Some problems I had.
1) Didn't handle backspace (vs. del) well, and other non-self-insert keys
2) If I was at the eol, it did nothing.

Also, a feature request for zle that will be rejected by workers...
3) Some sort of highlighting capability in zle, to see the selection.
