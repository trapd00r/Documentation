I'm not actually working on it at the moment.  I decided to wait until
after the 3.0 release before making functional changes like this.  But
if the consensus is in favour, it's really quite easy to produce a
patch.

That's going to break things.  Sometimes one *wants* a list of all
options -- not least in the completion for {un,}setopt.  If this change
is to be made, other things will have to change too.  This definitely
should wait.

Not that I'm implacably opposed to the idea -- I just think that such a
radical change to the behaviour of existing builtins in the default
case is a bad move right before a production release.
