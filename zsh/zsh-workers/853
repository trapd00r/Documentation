Here's a long-standing bug...

If you have a filename with two consecutive newlines in it, and
complete to it, the newlines are each surrounded by single quotes.
Consequently, the command line looks something like

host% ls a'
''
'b _

which, if RC_QUOTES is on, will be treated as a filename "a\n'\nb",
rather than "a\n\nb".

There's no need for anyone to fix this immediately; I intend to fix a
lot of matters involving completion and quotes sometime soon.
