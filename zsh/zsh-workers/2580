I made a patch for zsh-3.0.2-test3.  It is a patch against the clean
zsh-3.0.1 sources.  The first hunk of the FAQ patch will fail.

Changes since test2: redirection fix, awk generated rlimits.h, upgrade to
autoconf-2.12, improved fifo configure test.  The biggest change is in
configure that should be tested on as many machines as possible.
