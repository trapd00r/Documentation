The functions which have troubles with partial path completion are
functions which use CVS/Entries: _cvs_files, _cvs_files_modified,
_cvs_files_removed and _cvs_files_unmaintained.  So fallback call to
_files should be placed at end of them.  However _cvs_files_removed is
more problematic since it completes non-existing (but listed in
CVS/Entries) files, though.
