Before a formal release is made, it might be a good idea to make a
release zsh-3.0-gamma1 and announce it to a much wider audience.  Make an
announcement in comp.unix.shell and try to attract some new testers.
This would probably catch a new round of bugs and portability problems.

This would also be a good time to transition more of the work to
the documentation.
