thanks.  but i'm sure people would appreciate a name and a date (and
possibly the place it was posted to) as comments in contributions.

i'm in the habit of providing pointers like this as backlinks to where
i found stuff, and that it is contributed, not distribution-provided
etc.

you're too modest  :)
