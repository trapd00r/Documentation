} I know nothing about all this... just one question: is this parameter
} used elsewhere? Or should it be converted to a style?

It's quite possible that it should be converted to a style.  The code in
_mailboxes is quite old and was modeled after another completion function
that allowed a local variable to be overridden by a global ... I forget
now which one ... I changed it in 7962 from reading elements out of the
compconfig assoc array to using private variable names of its own, but I
never went back to it after the style system was introduced.
