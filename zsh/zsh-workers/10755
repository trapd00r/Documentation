Bummer. Of course, we don't have a way to specify a gap between cetain 
types of characters. But maybe what I showed is enough?

Hm... with the possible patterns in match specs I have only one
concern: speed. The gap-thing could probably be tested fast enough as
long as we don't allow too complicated patterns combinations. I
haven't really thought this through, though.

But it would almost certainly make the syntax even more irritating for
most. I think ;-)
