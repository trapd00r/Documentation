Hi.  I'm having trouble finding a recursive glob pattern that can help
me change permissions on all files except CVS directories.  I'd like to
have a checkout of a CVS repository in my web directory, but not make
the CVS information readable when I make everything else accessible.

For example, I'd like to issue something like

   $ cd WWW/checkout
   $ chmod a+rX **/*~CVS

to make all non-CVS files readable and all non-CVS directories readable
and executable.  But that ~CVS doesn't do any pruning.  Nor does ~*/CVS,
~**/CVS, etc.

Is what I'm trying to do supported by some globbing pattern?
