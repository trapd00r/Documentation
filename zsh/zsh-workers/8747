Well, I'm not really appropriate for this, I think, but here it is.

`grep' said that now there is no other reference to `comp1'. Apart
from the ChangeLog, of course.

 Controlling what is compiled into the main zsh binary
 -----------------------------------------------------
 
-By default the comp1, compctl, zle, complist, sched and rlimits modules are
-compiled into non-dynamic zsh and no modules are compiled into the main
-binary if dynamic loading is available.  This can be overridden by creating
-the file mymods.conf in the compilation directory (Src, unless you have
-told configure to use another directory) with the list of modules which are
-to be compiled into the main binary, one module name per line with no
-punctuation and no suffix.  See the zshmodules manual page for the list of
-available modules.

 On systems which do not allow symbols in one dynamically loaded library to
 be visible from another, comp1 will be compiled in to the base executable
