Yeah, let's sacrifice features for the benefit of incompetent
programmers. Who needs multi-line editing?

And why stop there? Let's think about a few logical next steps.
How about getting rid of the distinction between stdout and stderr by
default, because sometimes "randomcommand --help | less" doesn't work?
Oh, and let's not forget about SH_WORD_SPLIT, that's should definitely
be on by default, it surprises too many people. And have you ever
noticed how intimidating the completion system is? I think something
less arcane like the one bash uses would allow a lot more people to
contribute.
