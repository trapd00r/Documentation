Some of these may actually have been resolved and I just forgot/missed it.
Also, these are only issues raised in messages I sent myself.

10403		<(...) doesn't really create a FIFO
10346		rebuilding zshpaths.h
users/2979	assigning a string containing `:' to $path
10187		combining multiple zstyle commands into one
10169		%(l.t.f) and line wrapping in prompts
users/2973	clear to end of display
10154		$param:x and the FAQ
10080		move compctl support functions out of Misc/
10071		xtrace behavior of `.' and `source'
10005		bogus "no such job" / STAT_NOPRINT
9996		vared keymap
9982		comptest (lack of) verbosity
9962		renumbering comptest
9945		somebody check my work ...
9778		hanging on loops with lots of output
9762		nameddir assoc elements [*]
9702		configure switch for mymods.conf (cf. 9727)
9575		export arrays like ksh
9095		getopts is broken
9062		suspending `.' / `source'
9000		parameter formatting / ksh export (cf. 8674)
8861		posix module
8780		format of error messages
8758		locales and math (cf. 8792)
8698		bad node type in freenode (related to 9095?)
8619		locales and globbing
8378		configure --zsh-mem-debug

There are probably others from even longer ago, but my eyes are starting
to glaze over; I think I've reached the point of diminishing returns.

[*] as long as we're talking about fixing the lexer for AAs anyway ...

Also:

Document the kshautoload problem with the completion system and how one
works around it with zcompile.
