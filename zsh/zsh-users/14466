dotsrc.org (formally sunsite.dk) is shutting down hosting operations, so
the mailing lists will be transferring to a new site.  I'm posting this
ahead of time just to be quite sure we don't get caught short and leave
everyone in the dark; you don't need to do anything just yet.

The current plan is that Geoff Wing has kindly agreed to host the
mailing lists, using the same software as at present, at zsh.org, which,
you will probably agree, makes a lot of sense.  If all goes smoothly
we're hoping the current mailing lists will start sending replies
pointing out what's happened after the change.

The web site at Sourceforge, currently a copy of the one at
zsh.sunsite.dk, will become the master.  I've put a notice at
http://zsh.sourceforge.net/ about this; if everything does go dark,
that's the place to look for further news.  References to dotsrc.org in
the web docs will probably take a while to update properly.
