Which in a way makes sense though is not very useful. ~/.zshrc
is your shell configuration file. ~/.zprofile is you session
configuration file.

Generally, in ~/.zshrc, you put stuff that affects the behavior
of interactive shells (sets shell options, defines shell
aliases, configure completions).

In ~/.zprofile, you define what affects any process started in
your session not necessarily only the shell processes.
Typically, $EDITOR is an environment variable used by commands
like crontab, visudo, vipw... So it makes more sense to define
it once and for all for your whole login session.
