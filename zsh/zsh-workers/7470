Thanks. _xterm works well now.

But I feel X toolkit options specs in _xterm is bit redundant.
I think _xt_arguments such as following is useful.

# Since XrmParseCommand does not accept short options, it should not
# use "-s".

_xt_arguments () {
  _arguments \
    '-geometry:geometry:_x_geometry' \
    '-display:display:_x_display' \
    ...
    '-xrm:X resources:' \
    "$@"
}

# _gtk_arguments may be also useful.

Where is a suitable directory to store this?

Completion/User or Completion/Base (or Completion/X)?
