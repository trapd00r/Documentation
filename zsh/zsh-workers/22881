} git-bisect says the problem started with change #22557.

Given that, according to your build script, you compiled both the before-
and after-22557 sources with --enable-multibyte, the only change in 22557
that could possibly be related is this one:

--- Src/pattern.c	25 Jul 2006 09:25:27 -0000	1.37
+++ Src/pattern.c	25 Jul 2006 18:06:48 -0000
@@ -343,7 +343,7 @@
     /* Error.  Treat as single byte. */
     /* Reset the shift state for next time. */
     memset(&shiftstate, 0, sizeof(shiftstate));
-    return (wchar_t) *(*x)++;
+    return (wchar_t) STOUC(*(*x)++);
 }
 
 #else

Does backing out that STOUC fix the problem?  What underlying integer
type is wchar_t on the machine where you're building zsh?
