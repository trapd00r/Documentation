The documentation implies that _menu is nothing more than an example.
However, it has the side effect of disabling menu selection which can
be useful if you want pure menu completion in an _generic based widget.
The result is a lot tidier than adjusting your select style to exclude
a bunch of widgets. So this adjusts the documentation to mention that
use for it.
