Yes, but this definitely needs to be based on the stable branch.  There are
too many feature changes on the other branch already for it to be
suitable as the basis for a patch release.

Needless to say, I haven't been keeping proper track of bits that need to
go on the 4.0 branch, though I've tried to apply my own changes to both
branches where necessary.
