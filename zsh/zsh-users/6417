Hi,

when leaving a shell, the return status is that of the last command.
This makes sense, especially for scripts. But in an interactive shell, it's=
=20
sometimes a little surprising. I use konsole as terminal app and it display=
s=20
the exit status if !=3D 0 when a session is closed. Now when the session wa=
s an=20
interactive shell in which the last command failed/has been killed, this is=
=20
displayed.
Is there a way to make an interactive zsh always exit with 0 status unless =
the=20
shell itself died uncleanly?

TIA,
=2DMalte
