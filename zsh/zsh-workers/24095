Subject: print -Pc doesn't calculate column widths properly for %{...%}
MIME-Version: 1.0

When using print -Pc, Zsh doesn't discount anything between %{...%}
when calculating the widths of the items being printed.  This came as
sort of a surprise to me, but I guess it doesn't come up often in
nature.
