If this is 3.0.5, it may be the old problem with Src/makepro.sed, which
you should replace with the following.

(Note to list:  this really ought to go into any `final' version
of 3.0.)  The only difference is that there is a $ missing at the
end of the `from' expression in the s-line.

# makepro.sed by Mark Weaver <Mark_Weaver@brown.edu>
/^\/\*\*\/$/{
n
N
s/\n\([_a-zA-Z][_0-9a-zA-Z]* *\)\((.*\)/ \1 _(\2);/
p
}
