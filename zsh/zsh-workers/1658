Hi,

I dropped my subscription to the zsh mailinglist last winter
after upgrading to a FreeBSD system and a P5 chip.  Have sort
of lost touch with the lastest in zsh development....

I still use the zsh at home and here at work, and am wondering
if development is continuing.  And if so, where is the latest
and greatest versions.

A major problem that I've seen, and the only real problem with
the zsh is that at seemingly random times a ((zombie (?) )) zsh
will chew up 80-90% of my CPU.  Strange....

At any rate, please reply to me directly: `kline@tera.com' if
this list is still happening.

Thanks muchly.

gary kline
