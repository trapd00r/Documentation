It looks fine to me and I can't think of anything to suggest.

Good. I think it might be a good idea if all the 3.0.8 patches from
sourceforge are put together and released as 3.0.8a or 3.0.9 or
something. 3.0 is still sometimes useful and I think it would be handy
to have a final definitive release of 3.0 to refer to.

The `Version' section of the README file also needs updating.

There's quite a few problems on IRIX 5.3 which is now very old anyway so
I'll just update it out of Etc/MACHINES. It might be wise to remove some
of the other old entries from it too where we haven't had a positive
report in a long time (i.e. Cray, Data General, Next, Sco, Siemens).
I've removed the architectures next to the Linux entry because after
adding sparc, alpha, AMD Athlon, ia64 etc the list would be getting
silly.
