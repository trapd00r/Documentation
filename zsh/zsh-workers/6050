Re: Bart's message which I've lost about NO_RCS and GLOBAL_RCS_FIRST

It's probably not too late to alter GLOBAL_RCS_FIRST into something else
--- it's only useful if it appears in /etc/zshenv and I can't imagine it
has done, yet.

What would be the preferred strategy?  Test NO_RCS before every script
apart from /etc/zshenv, and skip them if it's set?  Does this meet
everybody's requirements?
