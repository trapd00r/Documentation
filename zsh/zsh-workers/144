I made a new release. It took me a long time to make this release since
between beta9 and beta10 many function, macro and variable name changed. I
did not tested it too much, so the version number is beta10-hzolipre10. I
managed to compile it and it seems to work.

I'd especially recommend it to Peter Stephenson as it contains a lot of fixes
and cleanups to lex.c and come less to hist.c. I'll try to merge his recent
patches into it (but I havn't had a look at them yet).

The files can be found under the directory

ftp://ktud.elte.hu/pub/zsh
