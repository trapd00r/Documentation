I wrote a function zmv that does; it would work like this:
  zmv '(*).phtml' '$1.php'
(positional parameters match parentheses). The bad news is it only works
with the latest development version, not 3.1.6.  However, I'll add it to
Functions/Misc from now on (it was posted to zsh-workers a few of months
ago), and it'll appear in future versions.

Actually, further bad news is that you can't do **/... with zmv yet, but
I expect that can be fixed.  I'll have a look sometime.
