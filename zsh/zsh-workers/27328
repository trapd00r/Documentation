Thanks---I think that means somehow it's got confused in the lexical
analyser, there's not much scope for more problems in get_comp_string().
That first word obviously ought to be "./x".  Possibly something hasn't
been reset properly after the last operation; we've seen a couple of
things like that.  We need to find out why the first
zshlex(), and hence gettok(), is setting tok to STRING but not tokstr to
"./x" (if it is, the problem is in get_comp_string() after all).  It
might well be something quite simple.
