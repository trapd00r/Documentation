Hmm ... have you noticed that every your question needs at least one reply
that requests clarification what you really mean? No offence intended :)

Returning to your question - if 

foo "$path[@]"

does what you need I do not see any reason why

foo "$bar[@]"

does not. If the question is, how to get a pair of variables like path/PATH
- it is done with typeset,

typeset -T FOO foo

creates an array foo and "colon array" FOO.
