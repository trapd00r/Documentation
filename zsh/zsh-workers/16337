I keep finding myself wanting a parameter expansion flag that
removes duplicate array elements (like typeset -U).

Also, this is from a user:

-----------------
I set:
	setopt nomenucomplete bashautolist noautomenu
but, after pressing TAB a few times, it still starts cycling.
Also, there does not appear to be an option to put the cursor below the
listed possible completions. These abberations are especially annoying
for people who are addicted to bash's tab-completion but would like to
switch to zsh for its more advanced feature-set.

------------------

I assume that he is using the new completion system, since it does start
cycling even if the options are set as he says.
