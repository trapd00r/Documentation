You're  right, it  doesn't  work  on FreeBSD  4.x.   My patch  addresses
FreeBSD 5.x  only, sorry for that.   As you say, using  command would be
more appropriate.  It does include command arguments, but apparently the
zsh _killall script already cuts them, so this is not an issue.

Apparently, the « command » option is also supported on GNU/Linux's ps.

Note that  if the _killall script  is run by root,  the arguments « ax »
and « ho »  must stick  together for  optimal interoperability,  this is
compatible with all systems I tried.

Best regards,
