I just noticed that Imlib's aclocal.m4 has stuff for this in it.
Copyright (as usual with autoconf material) is nice and simple.
It's 128 kB so I haven't included it.  I'm looking at imlib-1.9.14 from
the GNOME website, see http://www.gnome.org/start/installing/index.php3
for links.  Possibly it's in other GTK/GNOME stuff, this is the first
I've looked at in detail.
