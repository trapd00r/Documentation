} Possibly there's some bug in the NIS handling in completion.

The completion code just uses `userdirs' from the zsh/parameter module,
which in turn just reads from the nameddirtab, so the bug is in the C
code for named directories in general.

Is this possibly an NIS v. NIS_PLUS conflict of some sort?
