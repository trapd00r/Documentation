<H1 CLASS="chapterhead">DECwriter III/DECprinter III (LA120)</H1>
<H2>Overview</H2>
<P>The DECwriter III and DECprinter III are serial, dot-matrix, pedestal-mounted
printers that combine bidirectional printing and a 1K character buffer to achieve
180 character-per-second throughput. The printhead automatically seeks the next
print position, skipping over large areas of white space. With over 200,000
DECwriter III and DECprinter III printers already sold, these products have
achieved a solid reputation for continued reliability.</P>
<P>The DECwriter III, the keyboard send/receive version, was specifically
designed to be easy to use. It guides you through the wide range of available configuration
choices, uses mnemonic commands, has a prompting LED display, and a
special decal that summarizes set-up commands, and comes with a convenient
pocket-sized operator card that explains procedures for selecting features.</P>
<P>Utilizes the proven technology of its keyboard send/receive (KSR) partner, the
receive-only DECprinter III delivers high performance for local printing or communications.
The DECprinter III incorporates an internal Function Control Panel, a
series of controls and indicators, that permits rapid set-up, permanent or temporary
storage, and modification of all necessary parameters. In addition to providing complete
set-up control, the Function Control Panel displays the status condition of the
terminal while in the set-up mode. An external operator panel provides for the
selection of local mode, self-test, and top-of-form operation.</P>
<P>The following versions of the LA120 are available:</P>
<UL>
<LI><EM>LA120-DA</EM>: DECwriter III keyboard send/receive printer</LI>
<LI><EM>LA120-RA</EM>: DECprinter III receive-only printer</LI>
<LI><EM>LA120-RB</EM>: DECprinter III receive-only printer for four- to nine-part forms.</LI>
</UL>
<H2>Major Features</H2>
<P>The major features of the DECwriter III and DECprinter III printers are:</P>
<UL>
<LI>180-character-per-second bidirectional printing &#8211; for fast throughput.</LI>
<LI>1,000 character-line buffer &#8211; Enables the printer to accept characters faster
than it can print them and to look ahead to find the shortest path to the next
print position. This eliminates the need for fill characters when operating at
1,200 bits per second and improves throughput and utilizes the communication
line efficiently. There is an optional 4K buffer.</LI>
<LI>Selectable baud rates &#8211; Offers 14 data rates from 50 to 9600 baud plus eight
split baud rates with five different half- and full-duplex modes for versatility in
meeting communications requirements.</LI>
<LI>Full and half-duplex modem support &#8211; Allows the printer to be connected to a
modem or acoustic coupler, for compatibility with the dial-up telephone network.</LI>
<LI>Adjustable margins, tabs, and forms settings &#8211; Top, bottom, left and right
margins as well as horizontal and vertical tabs are easily adjustable and the set-up
commands can be held in nonvolatile memory.</LI>
<LI>Multipart form capability &#8211; The LA120 prints on six-part forms and a special
model has been developed that prints on nine-part forms.</LI>
<LI>Selectable character pitches &#8211; With eight different horizontal pitches and six
different line spacings to choose from, the LA120 provides flexible printed output.
Also, the expanded pitch can be used for labels and messages, while the
condensed pitch saves paper.</LI>
<LI>Optional character sets &#8211; National character sets include Finland, Denmark,
Sweden, Germany, Norway, and France. In addition, the APL set is available as
an option.</LI>
<LI>Nonvolatile memory &#8211; Stores feature settings so they can be recalled at any
time. There is no need to set up the operating parameters every time the terminal
is turned on.</LI>
<LI>Universal power supply &#8211; Lets you select the voltage setting that's right for
your environment.</LI>

</TABLE>
<H2>Printing features</H2>
<P>The DECwriter III and DECprinter III offer a seven-by-seven dot-matrix character
cell that provides output at the rate of 180 characters per second. This is suitable for
draft and data printing. Printing is done through a bidirectional technique in which
the printhead seeks the shortest distance to the next printable character, rapidly
skipping over blank spaces.</P>
<H2>Character Sets</H2>
<P>The DECwriter III and DECprinter III offer the full 94-printing-character ASCII set,
and print both uppercase and lowercase characters. Optional international character
sets include Finnish, Danish, Swedish, German, Norwegian, and French. In
addition, the APL set is available as an option.</P>
<P>The LA120 printers can print double-width characters and compressed characters.
Character sizes range from 10, 12, 13.2, and 16.5 characters per inch. Double-width
characters print at 5, 6, 6.6, and 8.25 characters per inch.</P>

<H2>Paper</H2>
<P>The LA120 printers accommodate fanfold paper from 7.6 to 37.8 centimeters (3 to
14 7/8 inches) in width. Because the DECwriter III and DECprinter III printers have
forms handling capabilities, they can format output to fit preprinted forms, up to six
parts. The LA120-RB has been developed to handle four- to nine-part forms. It is
not recommended for single sheets. Both the KSR and RO models can accommodate
selectable form lengths up to 35 centimeters (14 inches).</P>

<CAPTION>DECprinter III controls are found on the Function Control Panel, located beneath

<TBODY>

<TD ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="full1403.jpg" ALT=""></TD>
</TR>
</TBODY>
</TABLE>
<P>The control buttons found on the DECprinter III's internal Function Control
Panel are described below.</P>
<H4>Form Len</H4>
<P>The LA120 measures form length in lines per form. To determine how long your
form is, measure the length of the form in inches, then multiply that by the number
of lines per inch (horizontal pitch) you've selected. Form length ranges from 1 to
168 lines. For example, if your form length is 11 inches, and you selected a horizontal
pitch of eight lines per inch, then the number of lines per form is 88. Each
push of the FORM LEN button increments your form length by one line.</P>
<H4>Parity</H4>
<P>The parity feature enables the printer to test for parity errors in the characters it
receives. It also causes the printer to set the parity bits in the characters it sends to
the host computer can test the parity of those characters when it receives them.</P>
<P>If the parity feature is enabled and the printer detects a parity error in a character
it receives, it will print an error character in place of the character which was
changed in transmission.</P>
<H4>Sec Channel</H4>
<P>The secondary channel feature has two meanings. First, if full-duplex operation has
been chosen, the secondary channel is used to indicate the restraint mode. The
second meaning applies when half-duplex modem is selected. This secondary feature
can be used to indicate the presence of a secondary or reverse channel.</P>
<H4>Modem Control</H4>
<P>The modem control feature allows the printer to be connected to a modem or
acoustic coupler, for use with the dial-up telephone network.</P>
<H4>Auto Disc</H4>
<P>The auto disconnect causes a modem to automatically hang up the phone when it
receives an EOT (End of Transmission) from the host computer, or if the printer
becomes inoperable, which is most often due to a paper-out condition. This means
a DECwriter III can operate as a printer without the presence of an operator.</P>
<H4>XON</H4>
<P>This feature enables the printer to generate automatically the XON (DC1) and XOFF
(DC3) control characters. The XOFF character asks the host computer to stop
transmitting data to the printer. This prevents buffer overflow when the computer
sends data faster than the printer can print it. The XON code tells the host computer
to resume transmission of data. If the host computer recognizes the XON and XOFF
codes, this feature is enabled.</P>
<H4>Break</H4>
<P>Selecting the break feature causes the printer to send a break signal automatically
in response to a paper-out, cover-open, or printhead-jam condition. If your modem
system is set up to recognize break, sending a break signal may cause the phone to
hang up.</P>
<H4>Baud</H4>
<P>The DECwriter III and DECprinter III printers offer 14 data rates from 50 to 9600
baud plus eight split baud rates with five different half- and full-duplex modes. This
variety of data rates gives you the versatility needed to meet any communications
requirements.</P>
<H4>Store</H4>
<P>Feature settings may be stored in nonvolatile memory and then recalled at any
time. It is not necessary for you to set up the operating parameters every time the
printer is turned on.</P>
<H2>Programming Information</H2>
<P>The LA120 uses escape sequences standardized by the American National Standards
Institute (ANSI). If an escape sequence is received by the LA120 that is not
supported, it is ignored. Using escape sequences, you can control the following
LA120 features.</P>

<P>There are many other escape sequences you can use. For more information, see
<A HREF="appendixi.html">Appendix I</A>, the <CITE>LA120 User Guide</CITE>, or the <CITE>LA120 Operator's Reference Card</CITE>.</P>
<H2>Maintenance</H2>
<P>Over the years, DECwriter III and DECprinter III have been reliable in millions of
hours of customer use. The printhead provides time-proven reliability. The wires
are permanently lubricated for long life and resistance to wear. Wire curvature and
support mechanisms are designed by computer simulation for minimal wear and
fatigue. The use of constant-current solenoids and a ruby jewel head bearing
ensures precise character formation and uniform density of character impression.</P>
<P>To make the LA120 even easier to maintain, all components and subassemblies
are easily accessible. If replacement becomes necessary, the power supply and logic
electronics are easily accessed by removing two retaining screws in the back panel.
Naturally, servicing should be performed by qualified personnel.</P>
<H3>Self-test procedure</H3>
<P>If it appears that a problem exists in the LA120, you can initiate a self-test. Printing
and nonprinting self-tests are available. To initiate a printing self-test procedure:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Enter SET-UP mode. The set-up light will flash to indicate that you are in
set-up mode.</LI>
<LI>Press the "T" key to initiate the self-test. The LA120 will print out the self-test
pattern.</LI>
<LI>To stop the self-test, exist SET-UP or press any character. The self-test will
terminate and the set-up indicator will go off.</LI>
</OL>
<P>To initiate a nonprinting self-test procedure:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Enter SET-UP mode. The set-up light will flash to indicate that you are in
set-up mode.</LI>
<LI>Press and hold "SHIFT" and press the "/" key. The LA120 will perform the
nonprinting self-test.</LI>
<LI>To stop the self-test, exit SET-UP or press any character. The self-test will
terminate and the set-up indicator will go off.</LI>
</OL>
<H3>Operator Troubleshooting Checklist</H3>
<P>If your printer is not operating, chances are the problem is minor and you can correct
it yourself. Listed below are some of the common problems, their probable
cause and the corrective action that you can take. <STRONG>Note:</STRONG> Always turn off the printer
before you attempt to correct a problem.</P>
<P><STRONG>Printer does not start when power is turned on.</STRONG></P>
<UL>
<LI>Power cord is not connected, or broken. Check power cord connections; check
power cord for damage.</LI>
<LI>Power source fault. Check power cord at receptacle.</LI>
<LI>Fuse open. Make sure fuse is in place. Replace fuse if blown.</LI>
</UL>
<P><STRONG>Characters do not print.</STRONG></P>
<UL>
<LI>Printer out of paper. Reload paper.</LI>
<LI>Printer cover open or ajar. Close cover.</LI>
<LI>Printhead too far from paper. Readjust printhead adjustment lever.</LI>
<LI>Data set unplugged. Plug it in.</LI>
<LI>Incorrect communication set up. Check <CITE>LA120 User Manual</CITE>. Make necessary
correction.</LI>
</UL>
<P><STRONG>Light print.</STRONG></P>
<UL>
<LI>Printhead too far from paper. Adjust printhead adjustment lever.</LI>
<LI>Ribbon out of ink. Turn ribbon over or replace it.</LI>
</UL>
<P><STRONG>Paper does not advance.</STRONG></P>
<UL>
<LI>Paper not loaded properly. Check that the tractor covers are closed and the
feed holes are properly aligned.</LI>
<LI>Feed holes torn. Reload paper. If paper pulls against the tractor pins or bows in
the middle, readjust the right tractor. Sometimes the paper stack feeding into the
printer is crooked. Realign the paper stack so that the paper feeds straight into
the printer.</LI>
</UL>
<P><STRONG>Paper tearing on multiple part forms.</STRONG></P>
<UL>
<LI>Printhead is too close to the paper. Readjust the printhead adjustment lever for
a wider headgap, one notch at a time, and examine the last part's print impression.
Select the setting that gives you the best last part print quality.</LI>
<LI>Tractor incorrectly adjusted. If the paper pulls against the tractor pins or bows
in the middle, readjust the right tractor.</LI>
<LI>Paper not straight in printer. Realign paper.</LI>
</UL>
<P><STRONG>Printhead jam or printhead does not move.</STRONG></P>
<UL>
<LI>Paper or printhead jam. Clear jam and perform reloading paper/form procedure.</LI>
</UL>
<P><STRONG>Keyboard frozen or printer won't print.</STRONG></P>
<UL>
<LI>Printer cover open or ajar when printer is turned on. Close the cover and turn
the printer on. If the condition was caused by a cover-open fault, the printer will
reset itself. However, if a paper-out fault condition caused the printer not to print,
reset the printer by turning the printer off and then on.</LI>
