Seems to be a different problem... if I don't run screen, the problem is
there no matter how deep SHLVL is (I tried up to 4), wheras in screen,
the problem isn't there...

The problem is there on several linux boxes - uptimes:

janix~> uptime
 10:02am  up 13 days, 17:15,  9 users,  load average: 2.12, 2.10, 2.12
picard~> uptime
 10:03am  up 1 day, 15:30,  5 users,  load average: 0.29, 0.22, 0.08
willkuere~> uptime
 10:05am  up 187 days, 16:09h,  5 users,  load average: 0.00, 0.00, 0.00

Seems to be a problem with zsh and dxterm (aka DEC term).
