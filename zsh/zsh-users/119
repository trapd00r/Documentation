As I have mentioned before, you could indeed use TMOUT and TRAPALARM
to build an at-like function.  For "periodic", this is relatively
easy, but to make a generic sched thing you would have to maintain
some kind of priority queue.  If someone would hack together a shell
function for this purpose, it would be nice to include it in the
distribution.

For all my purposes, btw, "at" suffices.
