    Hi Bart :)

    Well... As I said a few weeks ago, I'm on the way of learning Zsh
and sometimes I practice what is said in the manual doing things like
these. Sometimes I have success, others I don't. I know, I make many
questions, and maybe you are the only able to answer then, so don't
feel guilty if you want to ignore most of them ;)))

    I know that I'm boring asking zsh questions every day...

    Ok, now I got it. Anyway I used (*/)# too with the same results,
so I thought that ** was magic everywhere in the path.

    I tried both, but with the last one ir2 was not found at the end
of the path :(((

    Exactly ;)))

    Didn't know about the mixing...

    Ok, it works like a charm... Thanks a lot, as always :)

    Sorry, I thought I was doing that already, but the mutt aliases I
use for zsh lists were all the same. I did the cut'n'paste but not
the modification, and all aliases go to zsh-workers. Sorry, this
answer goes to zsh-users. Thanks for pointing.
