This isn't really our fault, it's TeX's precious line-breaking algorithm.
It wants you to know it's damn well going to cram as much stuff onto a line
as it can whether you like it or not, and if it can't it's going to scream
like mad about underfull hbox's so you don't think you've got away with
it...

Perhaps there's a pretolerance value that can do the trick, but I don't
have the 10 hours it always takes when dealing with low-level TeX.
