Thanks!

I know this is not a zsh question, but...

I've never used it (procmail) before -- I've been using elm's filter(1) --
but this looks much more flexible and powerful. I've skimmed through the
man pages, and I think I understand what you're doing below except for:

I gather you're filtering the mail through some external program (rcvstore)
we don't have. Why? If you have time, can you explain a bit more what the
above recipe accomplishes?

Also, in contrast to zsh-list, SmartList doesn't appear to provide a `Reply-To:'
header. Consequently, replies not go to the author and not to the
list. There was some lengthy discussion a while back about whether `Reply-To:'
should be set, and if so what it should be set to. The consensus was to
include it, and to set it to zsh-list. Do you not want to do this, or is
there another way?
