I too have some global aliases for simple pipe commands, but I have
found it a little safer to use a short string of characters that is
more unlikely to ever be a filename than a single capital letter.
I have these that use a leading comma:

alias -g ,e='|egrep' ,f='|fgrep' ,g='|grep'
alias -g ,h='|head'  ,t='|tail'  ,w='|wc'
alias -g ,l='|less'  ,x='|xargs'

I also have a second version of each of those aliases that combines
stderr and stdout into the pipe, such as this one for less:

alias -g ,,l='|&less'

Yes, it does mean you need to type a space before the global alias, but
I always typed a space before a "|" anyway, so that doesn't bother me.
