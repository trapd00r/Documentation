Just for the record, I applied this patch and it appears to do exactly
what I wanted.  The only missing bit -- which I don't mind, but it came
up on another thread recently -- is that it takes two TABs (one for the
user part, and one for the host part) to complete one of the users-hosts
values, even if there's only one that matches the user part.

Thanks, Sven.
