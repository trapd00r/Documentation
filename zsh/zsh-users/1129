Dear Zsh users:
	I have just install Zsh,and I haven't root access.
	I want 'run-help' function know zsh builtin function and
	I found a file named 'Helpfiles' which can DO THIS FOR ME.
	BUT,it's a perl program,I haven't perl in my system
	Is there any other way to do this?Must I download perl to
	my system and compile it for just one program?
	Thanks a lot! Sorry my poor English.
