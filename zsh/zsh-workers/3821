When I was maintainer, I spent a couple weeks working on this idea,
and eventually threw all the code away.  It just got too hackish.

If you could make this work, it would be great.

As part of this, I wanted to merge the command search code with
the where/whence/type builtin.  There are several different places
where zsh goes searching for a command.
