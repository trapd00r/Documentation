zle calls init_term only if !termok holds, so it may cause a problem when
COLUMNS < 3.  But here the meaning of termok should be changed.  It should
contain flags, like TERM_BAD, TERM_NOUP, TERM_UNKNOWN, TERM_SHORT,
TERM_NARROW, etc.  init_term() should only be called if TERM_UNKNOWN is
true.  Line/column change should only change some flags in termok.
