  As a zsh-newbie I better describe what happens and what I want to
  switch off.

  Suppose I am at my $HOME/tmp/. directory. Furthermore there is only
  ONE additional directory called "TheLonelyOne" there. And I want to
  to change into that directory. As a lazy person now I would type on
  the commandline 

	  cd <TAB>

  and want to get 

      cd TheLonelyOne

  then instead all worldwide reachable directories as a suggestion.

  From my current point of knowledge I didn't neither know the correct
  naming for that behaviour (otherwise I may have already found the
  solution in the docs...) nor whether there are similiar conditions
  with possible other commands, which lead to such "I suggest you now
  everything worldwide possible"-behaviour of zsh (this by far no
  complainment against zsh or any critism !!! :) 

  Or with lesser words: If I would have a name of my problem I may not
  have that problem anymore... ;)

  My compinit-related stuff (as far as I am able to identfy it...) is:
  (from $HOME/.zshrc)


    # Search path for the cd command
    cdpath=(.. ~ ~/src ~/zsh)
    
    setopt   notify globdots nocorrect pushdtohome cdablevars autolist
    setopt   autocd recexact longlistjobs
    setopt   autoresume histignoredups pushdsilent noclobber
    setopt   autopushd pushdminus extendedglob rcquotes mailwarning
    unsetopt bgnice autoparamslash
    setopt   nobeep multios monitor
    
    ### completion stuff
    zstyle ':completion:*' verbose yes
    zstyle ':completion:*:descriptions' format '%B%d%b'
    zstyle ':completion:*:messages' format '%d'
    zstyle ':completion:*:warnings' format 'No matches for: %d'
    zstyle ':completion:*' group-name ''
    
    # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    xhost local:root 2>&1 > /dev/null
    # The following lines were added by compinstall
    
    zstyle :compinstall filename '/home/mccramer/.zshrc'
    
    autoload -Uz compinit
    compinit
    # End of lines added by compinstall
