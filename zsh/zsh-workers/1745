I used "typeset -U" in a function, and it had the effect of "local".  This
is pretty confusing.  I had to switch to "typeset -xU", which seems really
strange because you can't normally export arrays.

If a variable is set and then you attempt to add attributes to it with
"typeset", sometimes the value of the variable is cleared, and other times
it is not.  In particular, array variables MUST be set BEFORE you attempt
to use "typeset -U" on them; and string variables are cleared if you use
"typeset -L" or "typeset -R" on them.  There may be other such cases.
