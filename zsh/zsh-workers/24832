Sounds reasonable to me, but you have more idea of the structure of this
bit.

I wondered about that, but something along the lines of Bart's concerns
came to me.  Consequently, I was quite happy with an option that read as
THIS_IS_A_BIT_TECHY_AND_YOU_PROBABLY_OUGHT_TO_KNOW_WHAT_YOU_ARE_DONG
rather than GREAT_NEW_OPTION_TRY_ME_TRY_ME.  However, a suitably worded
caveat in the documentation might be a better method.
