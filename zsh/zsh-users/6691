    That's the problem, maybe: I haven't understood that from the
documentation. I mean, the docs talks about LBUFFER, RBUFFER, cursor
positions, etc... when talking about zle widgets, for example, but
doesn't say explicitly (I think, I haven't read the entire
documentation) that a word is not a semantic entity but just the
buffer contents from the cursor position to the next word boundary.
That's why I asked.

    I must confess that before asking I did a search on the mailing
list archives, and didn't found anyone asking anything similar. That
should be a clue for me that the problem was entirely mine. Maybe if
I had used more word-commands in my favourite editor or in my
ocassional uses of vi, I would have been less surprised with the way
of working of zle. Better luck next time :)

    Thanks for your help.
