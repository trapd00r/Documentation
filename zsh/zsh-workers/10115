Yes.

It does.  m4 treats the backslashes as normal characters; it's a macro
argument that contains several newlines.  That particular argument
ultimately ends up in the configure script, with newlines intact, in a
context where a single line is required by the shell syntax (have a look).
The backslashes are there to make /bin/sh happy about the newlines.
