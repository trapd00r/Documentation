In glob.c, in the function file_type() (which contains the delightful
comment "screw POSIX"), there is commented-out code that would return a
character '&' instead of '@' for a symbolic link that doesn't point
anywhere accessible.  Considering that compatibility with "ls -F" isn't
really an issue here (and '%' and '#' are returned for devices which ls
doesn't do), why is this code not used?

Secondly, I had an idea for a new option for a couple of builtins.
compctl has an option -L that makes zsh output the actual compctl
commands that one would have to input in order to get to the current
set of completion options.  A similar option would be very useful for
alias, bindkey (especially), limit, sched and typeset.  (typeset -L is
already taken, so it would have to be something else, but the others
can be -L.)  These options would not only be useful in normal use of
the shell, but would also simplify the reporter script greatly (which
btw won't run here -- awk syntax errors).  This option could be added
to each of the builtins quite easily, and without (much) risk of
breaking anything else.  What are people's opinions on this idea?
Richard, would you be willing to add this to the baseline before the
2.7 release?
