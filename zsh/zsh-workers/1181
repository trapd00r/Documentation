Can the here-documents be forced in the history list?

When I write:
fly$ while read line
> echo $line
> done
fly$
   ^ pressing C-p here will edit the whole while block

fly$ write tvujec <<xxx
> what are you doing?
> xxx
fly$
   ^ pressing C-p here will edit just the first line.

I would like to press C-p and be able to edit the contents of
here-documents.
