Hi,

I found out (from RH Bugzilla) that zsh is linked against ncurses.so
that usually lives under /usr/lib. This is very problematic if you are
using /bin/zsh as an emergency shell on a system that has not yet mount
/usr. Is there any way to avoid this? The report describing this in
more detail is at:

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=154395
