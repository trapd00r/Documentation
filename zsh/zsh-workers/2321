Please try to investigate it further so that I could reproduce this bug.

You are right, disabling a TRAP functions really removes the function.  The
patch below is a fix for that.  If a disable TRAPxxx function is enabled
the currently set trap with the trap builtin is replaced by the function.

The fix is not very elegant but it seems to work.
