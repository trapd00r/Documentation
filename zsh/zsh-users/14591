Any update on this?

I'm searching for a solution. Perhaps this can't be done as a built-in
syntax but what about a more complex solution. I'm a noob (and with
the numbers of features of zsh, I'm gonna be a noob forever), and cant
find a small, beautiful, zsh-is-so-cool-ish solution for it and dont
know how to effective implement it e.g., without using python, I like
some zsh only solution.

How people solved this problem any home-made solution for this, any tip?

Thanks!
