} That's not a file, it's a command name.  The rules are different for
} those.  You'll need to look at compctl, I'm afraid.

Or put the ,v in a directory that isn't in $PATH, which would make the
most sense anyway.  I'm not sure how the .~1~ file got created, but it
probably shouldn't be in the search path either.
