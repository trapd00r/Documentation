} Better ideas are welcome.

Not having a Debian install available anywhere, I'm not sure what
/usr/bin/pager does.  Is there a reason you can't simply assign to
$PAGER in /etc/z* as well?  With appropriate checks that it isn't
already set to something else, of course.
 
Then, how about this?  It's not really a problem to have a default
value of HELPDIR in the function, since we check that it exists.  I
suppose if someone wanted to explicitly turn OFF the use of HELPDIR,
this would be a problem ... is that worth worrying about?

Also, would /usr/share/zsh/$ZSH_VERSION/help be more appropriate?
