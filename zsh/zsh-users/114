Hi everyone,

zsh is the 5th shell I've used... it is by far my favorite so far
surpassing even tcsh and bash, IMHO.  However, I'm having a little
trouble with the sched commend.  I'd like it to perform the action at
the specified time rather than at the next prompt: for example, when I
want it to act as an alarm clock, or as "at", etc.

I've tried setting the NOTIFY option, which didn't change the behavior.

Is there a solution other than using at or tcsh's sched?

Thanks in advance,
Henry Ware
