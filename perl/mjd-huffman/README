-----------------------------------------------------------------

The program will probably run a lot faster if you get the `Memoize'
module from CPAN or from http://www.plover.com/~mjd/perl/Memoize/,
install that, and uncomment the three lines at the top of Huffman.pm
that use it.

----------------------------------------------------------------

There's a bug somewhere in here  that I never bothered to track down.
In some files, the last few bytes are garbled either in the compression
or the decompression phase.  I'm not sure which and I haven't found
a short test file that fails.  If you do find a short test case that
exercises the bug, or you find the bug, please let me know.
