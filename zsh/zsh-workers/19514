I just diffed my local build source (which was patched using posted diffs
from zsh-workers) against my cvs sandbox and found these tidbits:

diff ../zsh-forge/current/Src/Modules/terminfo.c  ./Src/Modules/terminfo.c 
368c368
< #endif /* USE_TERMINOF_MODULE */
---
> #endif /* USE_TERMINFO_MODULE */


diff ../zsh-forge/current/Src/Modules/terminfo.mdd  ./Src/Modules/terminfo.mdd
