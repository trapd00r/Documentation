The discussion "Tip of the day..." was very interesting and this makes
me think that one should be able to do very useful things.

Now concerning filename completion in particular... This works well in
many cases. But what about when the file one looks for is in some deep
directory, that one doesn't necessarily remember exactly? Filename
completion allows to speed up things, but isn't perfect. What do people
use? Bookmarks? Something based on locate? Something based on the zsh
history? Scoring techniques? etc.
