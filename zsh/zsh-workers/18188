Apropos of which, I've been thinking for a while that

% fn() { case foo in (bar) print yes;; ((a|b)) print no;; esac; }
% functions fn
fn () {
        case foo in
                bar) print yes ;;
                (a|b)) print no ;;
        esac
}

is suboptimal.  The following patch puts in a balanced leading
parenthesis.
