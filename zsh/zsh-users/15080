"_cap" isn't a standard completion function supplied with the shell, so it
looks to me like something funny is going on in there.  Find out what
that's doing and how it's been configured---does it have "#compdef cap" at
the start and does "print $_comps[cap]" output "_cap"?  The file
_cap will be somewhere in the list of directories you see with
"print -l $fpath" ("print ${^fpath}/_cap(N)" should tell you where
it is).

I presume you have run "compinit" in .zshrc to load the completion
system?  _cap is clearly assuming it's present (but for some reason finding
it isn't).
