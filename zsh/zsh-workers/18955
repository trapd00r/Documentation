I didn't think we were that lacking in terms of standard environment
variables. There's a number that could be handled by _command_names
(EDITOR, VISUAL, CC etc) perhaps. All *path, *PATH and LC_* variables
are handled by a pattern completion.

Though it's probably better to write them and hopefully over time they
can handle more systems.
