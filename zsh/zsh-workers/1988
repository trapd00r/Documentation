	I have some problems with the TERM variable. with AIX 4.1.2, setting 
TERM=aixterm seems OK, but if I recall older commands with Ctl P, the prompt 
disappears.
	When I am running a session under telnet (microsoft) from a PC with 
TERM=vt100, the arrow keys are not working correctly (that do nothing). But 
after running vile (the great editor), all is OK. But, note that it was 
identical with zsh-2.5
Best regards,

Jean-Max Reymond
