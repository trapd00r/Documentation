} What's going on?

For some reason the `_arguments -s ...' in the `query' state handler
(line 97 in _rpm) is not finding the -p option, and so instead is using
the spec '*:RPM package:->package_or_file' which causes _rpm to attempt
to run 'rpm -qa' to get a list of all installed packages on the system.

At first I thought this was because you used "rpm -qcp" and -c is not
listed by _rpm as a valid option in the `query' state (even though it
should be); but even "rpm -qp" doesn't work, only "rpm -q -p" gets it
right.

Is it a new problem that _arguments has trouble dealing with multiple
single-letter options packed in the same word?
