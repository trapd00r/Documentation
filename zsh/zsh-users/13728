That is a good word...

It has nothing to do with echo being a built-in.  You get the same
result with:

/bin/echo hello | /bin/echo $(/bin/cat)

or, the real reason this came up:

dpkg -S /usr/bin/nedit|dpkg -l $(cut -f1 -d':')

which does not work in zsh for the same reason.

True.  That really doesn't do much to address my question, though, which
is whether zsh is complying with POSIX here.
