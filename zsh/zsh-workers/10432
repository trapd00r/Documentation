You might want to update the date stamp to the right of the `News'
link on the main page too.

There's no need to write this; just link to

  http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=4068

like I've done from my page (the accuracy of which, incidentally, I'm
maintaining reasonably regularly).

No objection from me; you could include my .zshrc if you want, which
is always at:

  http://www.new.ox.ac.uk/~adam/computing/zsh/files/.zshrc

You could also include a link to my zsh page

  http://www.new.ox.ac.uk/~adam/computing/zsh/

under `Useful links', although I'm beginning to sound like an
egocentric maniac, so never let it be said I forced you into it ;-)

Yes.  It doesn't have to be one line, but brief is good.

Yes, we could.  Mirroring via rsync would be best, if it's possible.

Personally I really like the `out-of-the-box-ness' of the new
completion system, and would like to see that continue as much as
possible.  We already have a few platform-specific completions, and
adding more are hardly doing any harm.

Exactly.

I'm not too keen on the `Distribution' section.  When I was first
looking for the downloads bit, my eye completely missed this.  Could
we change it to `Downloads', with sub-headings as `Mirrors' and
`Mirror contents' respectively?
