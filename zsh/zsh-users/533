The command "bindkey -a '_' insert-last-word" allows me to insert the
last word of the previous command behind the cursor when I'm in vi
command mode.  I would like it to behave more like ESC-_ in emacs mode 
(and like vi command-line editting in ksh) --- insert the word under
(rather than behind) the cursor and then put me in vi insert mode.
Is this possible?

Thanks in advance.
