The most current ZSH pages have been gzipped and tarred to:

ftp://ftp.peak.org/pub/next/documents/misc/zsh-webpages-25-april-98.tar.gz

MD5 = 2faec4cc159063dee58b3b9e0b0ea8f2

It is over 2MB


There are a few folks who have offered to host the pages.

I think ideally the pages would be hosted on the same machine that hosts the  
zsh development and main FTP source.

What do y'all think and where would you like to see it?

ps -- Peter: I won't be able to update the HTML FAQ anymore, so you'll have  
to find out who finally takes over.  I'm getting close to graduation.
