I don't recall MSYS being mentioned here before (in fact I'd never
heard of it at all) so there may not be much we can do for you.

What does

    ls -l $(which -a less)

show you?  If zsh thinks one of those has execute permission and the
others do not, it'll prefer the executable one even if the others
are earlier in the path.  In fact if none of them appear to have
execute permission it'll probably say "command not found".

You might be able to get zsh to treat a .exe extension as equivalent
to having execute permission if you configure such that it believes
it's in the Cygwin environment.
