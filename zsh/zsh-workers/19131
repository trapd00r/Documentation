    Hi Bart :)

    Very clever, I'd never have thought about something like that...
I tried something like this, inserting $RANDOM before each filename
in a for loop, redirecting to sort (or using the (o) modifier to sort
the list by name) and using cut (or ${...##...}) for getting rid of
the random number. No doubt your example is better. Far better ;))

    Anyway I keep thinking that the (or) modifier would be useful ;)

    Thanks a lot for your answer. It's a neat, short and fast way of
generating random lists :)))
