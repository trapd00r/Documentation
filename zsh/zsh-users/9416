There's really only one, but it's a pretty comprehensive trick.

When you write
    ^str1^st2
zsh converts it internally to
    !!:s^str1^str2
which means that you can add a third carat and go on with your command
line, including appending a colon and then more history modifiers.
E.g.
    ^str1^str2^:u:p

(I'm not sure what you were hinting at with the "some kind of memory"
question.)
