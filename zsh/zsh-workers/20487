Please pardon me if I'm mistaken, but I don't really think you know what
"interactive mode" is supposed to do.

I say that because you said this:

I repeat what I said before:  Interactive menu selection mode was never
ported to zsh-4.0.x.  In the style

	zstyle ':completion:*' menu select interactive

zsh-4.0.x entirely ignores the word "interactive" and it's exactly as if
you used

	zstyle ':completion:*' menu select

So before you complain further, I suggest you drop the word "interactive"
from your style and tell us whether zsh-4.2.x thereafter behaves as you
expect it to behave.

With "interactive" in the style setting, that's not SUPPOSED to work.

		** Warning, very long example follows. **

Once the prompt

	interactive: []

has been displayed, TAB serves only to complete as much of the word as is 
unambiguous.  Chances are that after "ls <TAB>" there is no unambiguous
prefix.

E.g. I get, after one TAB ...

schaefer<502> ls
Completing files
Src/               config.h           config.modules.sh  ul*
Test/              Makefile           Etc/               Functions/
config.log         Config/            COMPS.zwc          Completion/
Doc/               config.status*     config.modules     BUILD
stamp-h            config.cache       config.h-xx        stamp-h.in

... and then after a second TAB ...

schaefer<502> ls
interactive: []
Completing files
Src/               config.h           config.modules.sh  ul*
Test/              Makefile           Etc/               Functions/
config.log         Config/            COMPS.zwc          Completion/
Doc/               config.status*     config.modules     BUILD
stamp-h            config.cache       config.h-xx        stamp-h.in

... at which point TAB does nothing until I type at least one character to
disambiguate.  So if I type "c" ...

schaefer<502> ls c
interactive: config.[]
Completing files
config.log         config.status*     config.modules.sh  config.h-xx
config.h           config.cache       config.modules

... and now when I type TAB ...

schaefer<502> ls config.
interactive: config.[]
Completing files
config.log         config.status*     config.modules.sh  config.h-xx
config.h           config.cache       config.modules

... at which point TAB again does nothing until I disambiguate further by
typing "m" ...

schaefer<502> ls config.m
interactive: config.modules[]
Completing files
config.modules.sh  config.modules

... and now do you see how this is intended to be used?
