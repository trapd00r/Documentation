Subject: fish-style directory navigation?
To: zsh-workers@zsh.org
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

Is there any plug-in available that provides fish-style directory
navigation? i.e. you can press Alt-Left or Alt-Right to go backward
and forward in history, just like in a browser. If there isn't, is
anyone interested in implementing one? That would be very helpful.
