Are you sure this isn't happening just because zsh presents the menu in
alphabetical order?

It depends on wheher you're using compsys or compctl.  Does your .zshrc
(or the /etc/z* files, I'm not familiar with Debian) contain

    autoload -U compinit
    compinit

??  If not, you have almost no control over the sorting order.

If you are using compsys, then the group-order style is probably what
you want:

zstyle ':completion:*' group-name ''
zstyle ':completion:*' group-order files directories

Read "man zshcompsys" for descriptions of group-name and group-order.
