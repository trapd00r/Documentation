A few minor (and probably totally unimportant ;-) corrections:

    Bart> There's a GNU package called "stow" (based on something
    Bart> called "depot" that originated at CMU).

=46rom stow.texi:

   Stow was inspired by Carnegie Mellon's Depot program, [...]

It is definitely not based on it (in the narrower sense).

    Bart> It's a package-installation utility designed for use in
    Bart> shared-filesystem environments.

Also according to stow.texi, it's for keeping files from different
packages apart, nothing more, nothing less.  So, when you have "a2p.1"
in "/usr/local/man/man1", you can easily find out which package this
file is from.

Of course you can *use* it for what you describe ;-) (And maybe that
was depot's intended use).

[SNIP]

Bye, J

PS: It's good to see support for stow... I use it for everything under
/usr/local.  Aaaand building Debian (and I guess RH) packages poses
some of the same problems: you need to `install' into a different
place than the one the package later has to run in.
