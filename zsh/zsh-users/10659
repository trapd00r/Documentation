I think you're confused about something here.

Vim, zsh, and mc are all just programs getting their input from a
terminal or terminal emulator.  The key bindings in zsh do not affect
what is sent by the terminal to any of the other programs; they only
affect how zsh interprets the input that is sent to it.  When zsh runs
an external program like vim or mc, it steps completely aside, so those
programs are getting input directly from the terminal, not "mediated"
through zsh's key bindings.

Thus "bindkey -m" is not what causes the terminal to send what you're
calling "binary" to zsh or to vim, it's only telling zsh what to do
when it receives binary.  Control of what is sent is somewhere else,
probably in a terminfo definition.  In other words, you must have
changed something other than just bindkey, and you may have changed
it somewhere external to zsh (such as in your terminal emulator's
configuration file).

If it's the terminfo, the setting of the TERM variable can change to
an alternate definition, and you might "fix" mc by something like

	alias mc='TERM=vt100 mc'

(choose a more appropriate value for TERM than vt100, that's just an
example).  If instead it's the emulator's configuration, the TERM
setting might also help if you can find one that matches what the
emulator is sending -- but if that doesn't work, you may not be able
to get both vim and mc to receive the input they expect.  Either way
the solution won't have anything to do with zsh key bindings.
