The definition of

     setopt AUTO_CD

should be changed from

If a command is issued that can't be executed as a normal command, 
and the command is the name of a directory, perform the cd command to 
that directory.

to

If a command is issued that can't be executed as a normal command, 
and the command is the name of a directory, then instead execute
    dirCommand dir

and zsh should provide a new builtin function

function dirCommand {
     cd "$1"
}

Personally, I would redefine this function to call a function that 
does a pushd.

Thanks

Dave
