Hi,

I have a script that is basically a proxy to run other commands and show the
output in a new xterm window, e.g.

~> xr make

In this case, how can I get the completion system to ignore "xr" and complete
for the command?

Ohh, and xr can take a single option --nopause, but the option should always
come before make.

I'm just starting out with the completion system, the complexity involved
seems, well, mind boggling.  What are some good resources?

Many thanks.
