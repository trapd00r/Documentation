Anyone want to toss some text at the Wikipedia entry for zsh?

    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zsh

It currently claims to be a stub entry, but it's not that bad (it does
reference the www.zsh.org web site, for instance).  It just might be
nice for someone who is good with words to tweak the verbage a bit.
