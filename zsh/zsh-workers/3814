You can probably guess what got me started on this.  Anyway, consider the
output of the following function (which must be run in a freshly-started
zsh -f or it is likely to exit prematurely due to the previous bug):

bindfoo () {
        bindkey -v
	# If the next line is uncommented, zsh crashes a few commands later
	# bindkey -r '\e'
	echo +++ BEGIN +++ ; bindkey
        bindkey -r '\e[A'
        bindkey -r '\e[B'
        bindkey -r '\e[C'
        bindkey -r '\e[D'
        echo +++ REMOVED +++ ; bindkey
        bindkey "[A" up-line-or-history
        bindkey "[B" down-line-or-history
        bindkey "[C" forward-char
        bindkey "[D" backward-char
        echo +++ ADDED 1 +++ ; bindkey
        bindkey -a "[A" up-line-or-history
        bindkey -a "[B" down-line-or-history
        bindkey -a "[C" forward-char
        bindkey -a "[D" backward-char
        echo +++ ADDED 2 +++ ; bindkey
        bindkey -a '\e[A' up-line-or-history
        bindkey -a '\e[B' down-line-or-history
        bindkey -a '\e[C' forward-char
        bindkey -a '\e[D' backward-char
        echo +++ ADDED 3 +++ ; bindkey
        bindkey -e
}

Following "+++ BEGIN +++", we have (in part):

"^["    prefix
"^["    vi-cmd-mode
"^[[A"  up-line-or-history
"^[[B"  down-line-or-history
"^[[C"  forward-char
"^[[D"  backward-char

Following "+++ REMOVED +++" (so far so good):

"^["    vi-cmd-mode

Following "+++ ADDED 1 +++" (first bug):

"^["    vi-cmd-mode
"["     prefix
"[A"    self-insert			<--- WHAT?
"[B"    down-line-or-history
"[C"    forward-char
"[D"    backward-char

Following "+++ ADDED 2 +++" (where'd "[A" go?):

"^["    vi-cmd-mode
"["     prefix
"[B"    down-line-or-history
"[C"    forward-char
"[D"    backward-char

Finally, following "+++ ADDED 3 +++':

"^["    vi-cmd-mode
"["     prefix
"^[[A"  vi-cmd-mode			<-- WHAT?
"^[[B"  down-line-or-history
"^[[C"  forward-char
"^[[D"  backward-char
"[B"    down-line-or-history
"[C"    forward-char
"[D"    backward-char
