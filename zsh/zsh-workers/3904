3 goaway/2:b9 43 % which ed
/usr/local/bin/ed

3 goaway/2:b9 44 % ed --version
GNU ed version 0.1

(looks like i was already using it...)

/bin/sh is the ordinary DU 4.0B /bin/sh

I'm just rerunning configure with zsh (3.0.5) - it'll take a little while to
run, so i'll report back a bit later with what happened.
