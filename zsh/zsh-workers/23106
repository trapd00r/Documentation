I regularly have a corrupt history file with zsh 4.3.2. The problem
appeared when one of the machine was upgraded to x86_64 + zsh 4.3.2
(previously it was under Debian/stable, therefore i386 + zsh 4.2.1).
I have the following options set:

courge:~> setopt | grep hist
extendedhistory
histignoredups
histignorespace
histnofunctions
histnostore
histreduceblanks
incappendhistory
