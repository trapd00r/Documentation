Subject: duplicate printexitvalue with mailcheck
Message-ID: <20031013023510.GA11368@dylex.dylex.net>
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Disposition: inline

The printexitvalue option shows multiple exit values when MAILPATH/MAILCHECK
is set and new mail is found.

Relevant environment:
zsh 4.0.7 (i686-pc-linux-gnu)
MAILPATH='/home/dylan/mail?New mail in `basename $_`'
setopt printexitvalue

dylex:~>echo "foo" >> mail/test
dylex:~>false
zsh: exit 1
New mail in test
zsh: exit 1
dylex:~>

Apologies if this is a known bug, it's just been bugging me for a while.
