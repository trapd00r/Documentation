Subject: Recommend Small Change in ZSH Manual Text

Since I was initially confused with the oxymoron, "required option", in the manual's explanation for the built-in, "getopts", I recommend simple change in the text to make it easier to understand. Otherwise, some people will invariably look to see how to
 require an option, which, of course isn't there.

In the ZSH Manual section explaining  "getopts optstring name [ arg ... ]"

Change 1.) This change is to match the word, "required", used below (see Change 2).

From:
   "If a letter is followed by a `:', that option is expected to have an argument."
To:
   "If a letter is followed by a `:', that option requires an argument."



Change 2.) This change is to get rid of the oxymoron and clarify the description.

From:    ...... and to `:' when a required option is missing. 

To:         ... and to `:' when a required argument is missing.
Or to:     .... and to `:' when a required option's argument is missing.
