Subject: searching upwards from cwd

The EQUALS option is very handy, and I'd like to have something similary,
but with a different search path.  My working directory, is structured like this:

  work/
    adresses.txt
    cvs/
      projectx/
        src/
          foo/
      projecty/
        ...

I'd like to be able to open addresses.txt in a single command without knowing
about the working directory.  At the moment, the command depends on cwd:

  work/  =>  less addresses.txt
  work/cvs/  =>  less ../addresses.txt
  work/cvs/projectx/  =>  less ../../addresses.txt
  work/cvs/projectx/src/  =>  less ../../../addresses.txt

It would be very helpful to have an alternative syntax similar to
'**/<filename>' and '=<filename>' that looks upwards in the path.  Maybe

  **/adresses.txt   =>  look in all subdirs
  =addresses.txt => look in the PATH
  .=addresses.txt => successively look in ., .., ../.., ../../.. and so on
  **.=addresses.txt => works like .=, and if that fails works like **/

(or whatever the syntax would be).

I'd be happy to have it as a zsh function, but I think it could be done
much more efficient in the source code.

Ciao
