Thanks for the help, I searched but didn't find modentry.c. (This file
calls `boot_' and `cleanup_', how is this turned into `boot_foo' and
`cleanup_foo'??)
Anyway, this might indeed require that we make setup and finish
mandatory. I have to say a bit more about this which I will send as a
separate mail.

This doesn't happen for me, are you sure that you haven't configured
deltochar to be statically included in zsh?
