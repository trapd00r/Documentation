Both socket and nsl, on all versions of Solaris as far back as I can
remember.

There's already
	AC_SEARCH_LIBS(yp_all, nsl)
earlier on from
	AC_CHECK_LIB(socket, socket)
but switching those around doesn't seem to help me.
I tried a few other things, but I know very little about autoconf,
so haven't got it to work yet.

One problem I do notice in my config.log is that all the tests link with
-lnsl before -lsocket, which isn't the right way around.
