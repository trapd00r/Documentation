Not really, unless you want to avoid global aliases whilst writing
something which can special-case things like "svn rm"; you could have
nested case statements examining different items in ${(z)BUFFER} and
possibly triggering other effects too.  Heck, build a whole new dispatch
system for command hooks, a la compsys.  ;^)

In summary, zsh is mighty and there's more than one way to do it.
