:Hey, there, mailing-list-archive maintainer, how's about including the
:X-Mailing-List header somewhere in what's visible and searchable, so
:that the patch numbers in the ChangeLog can be used to hunt this stuff
:down?)

Yes, well, unfortunately I set it up with (a minorly hacked version of)
hypermail which is somewhat limited.  I had planned to write my own simple
one or maybe switch to one that does keep specific headers (mhonarc?) but
there are many things I didn't like (when I last looked 1 - 1 1/2 years ago)
about all of the existing ones anyway.  As for writing my own, well, time is
available to me only for short periods at the moment.
