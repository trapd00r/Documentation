A small question about menu completion:

This will work:

phobos% zmodload zsh/complist
phobos% autoload -U compinit 
phobos% compinit
phobos% bindkey m menu-select 
phobos% echo /<M-m>

while this won't:

phobos% autoload -U compinit 
phobos% compinit
phobos% zmodload zsh/complist
phobos% bindkey m menu-select 
phobos% echo /<M-m>

Does the order of compinit and complist really matters?
