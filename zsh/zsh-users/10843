Could you kindly explain the difference? I thought it's always the
same - a process (being the current shell, or cleartool, or whatever)
is doing a fork, followed by an exec of the new shell.

In the particular case of "cleartool setview", I don't know how it is
done, but here is an example of the PIDs:

$ echo $$
25494
$ echo $PPID
25493
$ cleartool setview rofi_dft
$ echo $$
2965
$ echo $PPID
25494

So PPID changed (which I thought is very natural, since I have a new
parent process now).

The same effect appears if I invoke "zsh" instead of "cleartool....", so
we have what
you call a "second-level shell".

Now I wonder what exactly would be a "subshell" then....

I can't use traps here, because I know only at "exit time", whether
I want to logout completely, or just go up one level.

Here again, I would need to decide at the time I'm calling the
subshell, what to do at the exit-time.... so not useful for me
either.
