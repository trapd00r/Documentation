You're thinking of the KSH_ARRAYS option, which does have the effect you
say.  The old behaviour of the shell as shown above really was
that inconsistent... if you asked for 0 or 1 you got "one", if you asked
for 2 you got "two", but if you asked for the range 0 to 2 you got not
0 and 1 and 2, but just 1 and 2.  That's why we want to remove that
behaviour (at least by default).
