The incremental search looks through the entire in-memory history, so
whatever value is set by HISTSIZE, that is the number of lines that are
around to search.  There are several options that affect how duplicate
lines are treated that can affect a search that does not begin at the
bottom of the history (since the search does not wrap around):

    hist_find_no_dups
    hist_expire_dups_first
    hist_ignore_dups
    hist_ignore_all_dups
