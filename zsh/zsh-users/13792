Without looking at this in any detail (which I'm not going to do), it
sounds like you're going to have to use "compadd -P <something>" to skip
over what's been added already so that it starts the completion afresh
each time.  The <something> probably ends in a space, possibly "* ".  It
sounds like you you also need space as a removable suffix (compadd -q -S
' ').

In a fully "compliant" completion function you would usually use _wanted
before the compadd to get tag support correct, but that's just the icing
on the cake.
