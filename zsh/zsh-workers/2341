} I'm so impressed with the dynamic library code I couldn't resist

Could I suggest that we immediately identify a subdirectory other than
Src/ where contributed modules can live and have their own Makefile?
I think this would be far preferable to cluttering Src/ with a bunch of
files with "mod_" prefixed to their names.

It might also be useful to have a standard (but by default not present)
directory where the build process looks for locally-supplied modules to
compile.
