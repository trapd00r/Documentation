Not here, although I am 64-bit.  I'm using FreeBSD 6.2/amd64 and do not
see this; the (IMO) relevant options I set for build are:
  --enable-zsh-mem --enable-zsh-secure-free
  --enable-zsh-debug --enable-zsh-mem-debug
  --enable-multibyte
and gcc is 3.4.6.  If I build with gcc 4.2.4 then the results are
identical.  Tests run eight times (5x gcc3, 3x gcc4) -- are the errors
more occasional than this?

I get one solidly repeatable test failure, working from a fresh CVS
checkout; including it below instead of starting a new thread, in case
it's a sign that I'm not running the tests correctly (I've *cough* never
run them before).  I also, on one iteration of the tests against zsh
built with gcc4 got the second error below; I haven't dug into it, but
it's sleep-based, is it known to be load-sensitive?  Hrm, at the same
time as that failed, the tests against zsh built with gcc3 running in
another pty hung in Y01completion.ztst.  I ended up sending INT and
re-running, the tests ran to completion with only the by-now-expected
error shown.

Some blockdevice and /dev/fd/0 tests were skipped.
