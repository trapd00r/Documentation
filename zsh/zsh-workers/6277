Hello:

I've noticed lately that zsh-3.0.05 hangs on AIX while performing this style
of loop I used to use on bash and ksh:

cat somefile |
while read cell
do
  if ! grep -q $cell some_other_file ; then
    echo $cell
  fi
done

After the end of input, the loop hangs and does not respond to ^Z or ^C.  I
have to kill the shell completely.  Can any of you think what might be
happening?
