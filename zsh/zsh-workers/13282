} I found that Functions/Misc/mere is useful.

I find that Functions/Misc/mere is confusing, because I always expect it
to do what "harden" actually does.  But this is because years ago someone
I worked with had a csh alias named "mere" short for "cmere" (say it with
a hard C) short for "comehere".

I seem to recall that some OSs ship a "manroff" command that figures out 
all this -T stuff and which -m options to pass.  I could be remembering
some local sysadmin's hack from my past.
