For the time being, I'm only going to worry about the man pages.  Eventually
we can probably convert them to other formats using rman.  But since this is
a lot of work, it should probably wait until we get closer to the production
release (whenever that is).

Mark and I have looked at various alternatives (pod, linux-doc, etc..) for
use with zsh documentation, but so far, none of these fit the bill (although
pod comes pretty close).
