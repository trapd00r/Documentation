    Hi Ronald :)

    Uff, that was difficult to guess...

    Cool! BTW, I always thought that TMPPREFIX should "point" to an
already existing place plus a prefix, I never assumed zsh would
create any intermediate directory, but from certain point of view I
find reasonable to think that the directory would be created. But it
is not, so...
