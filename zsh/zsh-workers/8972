It is possible to list valid tags for a given context with _complete_help. Is it
possible to get list of valid styles in the same way?

May be even more. What I think about is to add additional paramter -
description - to _style. Then, it may be used as on-line help giving short
explanation, what these styles are used for. Something like normal usage
message.
