} There seems to be a problem quoting open bracket:

Yes, I found that while writing the test script, too.  I've fixed it; a
fragment of D06subscript.ztst:

  o='['
  c=']'
  A[\]]=cbrack
  A[\[]=obrack
  A[\\\[]=backobrack
  A[\\\]]=backcbrack
  print -R $A[$o] $A[$c] $A[\[] $A[\]] $A[\\\[] $A[\\\]]
  print -R $A[(i)\[] $A[(i)\]] $A[(i)\\\\\[] $A[(i)\\\\\]]
0:Associative array keys with open and close brackets
>obrack cbrack obrack cbrack backobrack backcbrack
>[ ] \[ \]

This passes with the code I have now, and hope to commit tomorrow night.

} 4.0.1-pre-1 is even more funnier ...
} so I ask myself if it ever worked

No, it never worked before, and quoting of `*' and probably also of `@'
still won't work even after I get done.  assoc[\*]=foo assigns to the
key `\*', not to the key `*', and assoc[*]=bar fails silently (I'm not
sure why it's silent).
