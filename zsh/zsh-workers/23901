Hiya,

this is in my opinion a minor bug of zsh:

read -s 'pw?Enter password: '

Should disable the local echo *before* issuing the prompt.
Because the use starts typing as soon as he sees the prompt.

ioctl(10, SNDCTL_TMR_STOP or TCSETSW, {B38400 opost isig icanon -echo ...}) = 0
ioctl(10, SNDCTL_TMR_TIMEBASE or TCGETS, {B38400 opost isig icanon -echo ...}) = 0
ioctl(0, SNDCTL_TMR_TIMEBASE or TCGETS, {B38400 opost isig icanon -echo ...}) = 0
write(2, "Enter password: ", 16Enter password: )        = 16
rt_sigprocmask(SIG_UNBLOCK, [CHLD], [CHLD], 8) = 0
read(0,

Cheers,
Stéphane
