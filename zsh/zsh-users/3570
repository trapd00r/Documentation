Subject: permanent commands in history?

There are some command lines that I use frequently, e.g.

  xemacs &!
  make CFLAGS="-Wall -Werror -O2 -g"
  fvwminstall -f

etc.  Most of the time these are in my command line history and
accessing them is easy, e.g.

  <m><cursor-up><return>

However, once in a while these are removed from the history file
(1000 lines).  Is is possible to make certain command lines
permanent in the history file so that I never have to retype them?
Of course I could write aliases, but then I would have to type
more letters to invoke the functions.

Bye

Dominik ^_^  ^_^
