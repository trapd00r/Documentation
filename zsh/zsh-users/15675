It may be related to the window manager: I use fvwm, where the resize
isn't real-time. But the same problem *sometimes* occur with real-time
resize (Style "*" ResizeOpaque); it seems to always occur when one
increases or decreases the width by 1 column only (otherwise the last
two SIGWINCH's generally occur during the same second, so that the
problem is not visible).
