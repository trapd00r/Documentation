Hi,

I am not subscribed, but I wanted to mention this:

zsh 4.1.1 has issues with autoconf from CVS which shows it failing the
func_success() tests.

./configure
func_success failed.
func_success failed.
Found no shell that has working shell functions.

Please tell autoconf@gnu.org about your system.
func_success failed.
Found no shell that has working shell functions.

Please tell autoconf@gnu.org about your system.

4.0.9 does not have a problem, bash doesn't.  Only zsh 4.1.1.

Anybody have a clue what gives?
