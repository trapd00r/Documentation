Ah, I see.

When i say [*] i get words that start with a *, but when i say \** i
only get words that a) start with a * and b) contains a second *
somewhere.

Holding down tab to cycle the list, I get an increasingly long word
forming on the command line. Seems it loses track of what is part of
the completion word. This is what i got after a few seconds,
*.cue`*~og*|*/*.ogg|*/01*|*|*/*.ogg|*/*.mp3|*/ogg/*.jpg|*/ogg/frommp3_320|*.jpg|*/*.ogg&**/_wget

13000

It also depends on how fast the code is :)
