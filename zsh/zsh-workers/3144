The test patch does not contain patches to the generated manual.  The final
patch and the source distribution will of course include the patches for
zshbuiltins.1.  Of course you can always get yodl from
ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/unix/ and format the documentation yourself.  It
is really easy to install.
