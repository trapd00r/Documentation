} This seems to fix part of the problem, but not all of it.  I don't know
} what it breaks.

This doesn't help at all for me.  I still get a reproducible crash.  (I
applied the equivalent patch to the non-unicode section of the code.)

Inside that same (col >= columns) block is an fputs() call that's intended
to make sure that the line really has wrapped when col == columns.  I'm
not sure, looking at it, why that's only necessary when (colors).
