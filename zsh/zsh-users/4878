No, I mean, if you try to send a line like:

% echo "hi\athere"

then the BEL will terminate the string sent via the preexec and ``there''
won't end up in the title but will be sent normally onto the display.

:> normal line because it'll terminate the title-set OSC in the print

:OSC ?

OSC=Operating System Command, a terminal (emulator) specific char sequence.
In this case, the  ESC ] 0 . . . ST  sequence to set the title.

:> preexec().  You'll also have problems with xterm with other non-

AFAIK, you'll still have problems even using the ${(QV)1} sequence because
it gets the line in a raw form - but the print parses it. e.g.

% echo "hi\nthere"

will fail because the V operator won't be effective since \n are just two
characters but the print command in the preexec converts it to one
special non-printable character which terminates the title-set OSC.
