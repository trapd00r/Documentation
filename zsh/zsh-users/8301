Yes... doesn't that just mean that it's free to be assigned any
meaning that an implementer might care to give it?

Ah.  Perfect.  I'm sure tried that before and it didn't work -
perhaps I hit the period when it was broken...

I don't quite see that - aside from the very real underlying
implementation issues, what is wrong with a conceptual model
that views:
    a | b | c
as pure syntactic sugar for:
    a > >(b > >(c))
?

Would it not be appealing to _define_
    exec | wc
to mean:
    exec > >(wc)

given that it doesn't currently mean anything at all?

Regardless, appreciate your help with identifying a working
syntax...
