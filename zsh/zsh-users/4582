} No, I already have that im my prompt.  The problem is that only
} "/home/luthien" is written as "~",
} not "/net/server/share/home/luthien".

My "stupid zsh tricks" entry for the month:

    hash -d /=/net/server/share/home/luthien

This causes zsh to write /net/server/share/home/luthien as tilde-slash,
which is pretty nearly indistinguishable from tilde.  It means that
sub-directories of your home directory will sometimes be displayed as
~//subdir, but maybe you can live with that.
