I would not say that it was intentional.  I always thought that eval is
necessary for that.  In addvars() there is an explicite singsub() call to
substitute the left-hand-side of an assignment which is now only used to
substitute the index of the assignment.  The change was that the lexer
gives the assignment token only if a word of the form number=value or
name=value or name[index]=value appears in command position where name has
only alphanumeric characters and underscores and starts with a letter or an
underscore.  This fixes problems with 1foo=bar assignments.
