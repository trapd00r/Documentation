    Have you looked at the code for 'allopt'? I think that *that* is
too much ;) This is shorter and produces more or less the same
results. And you can store it in a function, of course. The only
advantage of 'allopt' is that it accepts a list of names or part of
names to search for using grep. But that is easily added to the
above, too.
