The following should do for now.

  for f in http://zsh.sunsite.dk/Guide/zshguide{,{01..08}}.html; do
  lynx -source $f >${f:t}  
  done

(`w3m -dump_source' is an alternative to `lynx -source'.)

indexing, perhaps using the same Yodl packages the manual does and
texi2html.  However, my first target is to finish it off.
