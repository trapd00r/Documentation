Subject: Something else wrong with _multi_parts
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Given something like

	names=( foo bar home/test /usr/tmp /tmp/foo )
	_multi_parts / names

Only (/usr/tmp /tmp/foo) make it into the `matches' array in _multi_parts.
I would have expected to be offered (foo bar home /) as the initial set of
completions.
