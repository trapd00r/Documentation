Sorry, that means that my information is lacking.

However, that also means that something else is wrong, which I even
have a harder time seeing. The options are not set, at least I get not
the results I expect.
- No history is written
- If I want to start a program in subdir 'source' and enter
	sour<tab>
I get
	source _
not the
	source/_
I expect.
- auto_list seems to work, I was not thouroug enough here.

I browsed in zshoptions for anything related to directories and the
history, but couldn't find anything.

Thanks for your time!

Thorsten
