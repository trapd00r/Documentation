You can find this under:

Fri May  3 03:38:28 1996  Zoltán Hidvégi  <hzoli@cs.elte.hu>

	...

        * merged the patches from beta15-hzoli14.  Here is the ChangeLog
          for that:

        March/April 1995

And here comes a long list.  So it is really old but it got into the
baseline only in beta17.
