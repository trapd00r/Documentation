May be, it's time to allow for binding of generic keys instead of just escape
sequences. E.g. in vim (or elvis) you can map charaters Right, Left, Home, F1
etc. Let's be more user friendly :-) Zsh already has access to termcap/terminfo,
so it is little overhead - but it at least will make startup files much much
simpler (assuming, that you work under more than one terminal type)
