elm-2.4ME+ processes text-only mime messages without calling metamail.
There are also several security fixes in that version and built-in PGP
support.  It is available from ftp://dionysos.fmi.fi/KEH/ but there is a
mirror in ftp://ftp.cs.elte.hu/pub/unix/elm-2.4ME+/ :-).  I apply patches
using |$patch when I read a mail with less.
