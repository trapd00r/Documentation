Actually it is quite simple. It takes info -o - output, cuts off
evrything after "--- Detailed Node Listing ---" (which sometimes has
spaces around sometimes not) then gets all lines "* xxx" except "*
Menu:" and then tries to extract node names and descriptions, where
lines match one of

* Node: (file)section. Description   - top level dir
* Node:: Description                 - normal menu
* Node: section                      - index

(I think listing sections for index entries makes sense; if not it can
already be simplified :-) 

nothing really exciting.
