   You can use a signal and trap it from the running zsh:
     trap "source ~/.zshrc" USR1

   Then just send the running zsh the USR1 signal. (kill -USR1).

   In effect, signals are a simple form of communication. They are just
   somewhat limited because you can't attach data when sending a signal.


For my immediate purposes that'd be good enough, actually.  Thanks.

On a related note, does anyone know where I can find a listing of the
default actions zsh performs in response to the various kill signals?
I hoped to find this info in zshall, but no dice.
