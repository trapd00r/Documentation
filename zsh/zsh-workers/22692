 Note that, unless the `tt((P))' flag is present, the flags and any subscripts
 apply directly to the value of the nested substitution; for example, the
 expansion tt(${${foo}}) behaves exactly the same as tt(${foo}).

+At each nested level of substitution, the substituted words undergo all

+(i.e. leading tt(~) and tt(=)).  Thus, for example, tt(${${:-=cat}:h})
