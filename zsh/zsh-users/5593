Hiya, 

Should this; 

  typeset -a mailpath
  for i in ~/mail/*.spool; do 
    set $mailpath[$#mailpath+1]="${i}?You have new mail in $(basename $i .spool)."; 
  done

have worked? I got around it by using $MAILPATH, but 

  zsh: /home/hcksplat/mail/X.spool?You have new mail in X. not found
  $ 

doesn't seem right to me. ZSH_VERSION=4.0.4, setopt gives nobeep,
correct, noglobalrcs, histignoredups, histignorespace, interactive,
monitor, shinstdin.

Thanks, 

	Aidan Kehoe
