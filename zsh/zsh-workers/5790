} too early in my /etc/zshrc then completion won't work. e.g.
} % echo $ZSH_<TAB>         # fails
} 
} I had it after autoloading of all $fpath stuff, but before
} setopt, bindkey, ulimit, umask

I can't reproduce this one in pws-12 either.  It behaves differently after
the unsetopt you quoted, but not (that I can tell) after only the setopt,
and it doesn't fail in either case.

} Are any of these supposed to influence it in any way?

Bindkey might if you rebind TAB, C-d, ESC TAB, or ESC C-d.  Which you did't.
The setopts shouldn't (and don't, as far as I can tell).
