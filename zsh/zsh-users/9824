Hi Bart,

When I removed the backslashes, I have no output.  Could this problem  
be related to the Zsh options I have set in my environment?  I have  
the following options set (or unset).

	setopt                         \
			auto_pushd             \
		 NO_beep                   \
			brace_ccl              \
		 NO_cdable_vars            \
		 NO_clobber                \
			complete_in_word       \
			correct_all            \
			extended_glob          \
			glob_complete          \
			glob_subst             \
			hist_allow_clobber     \
			hist_reduce_blanks     \
		 NO_hup                    \
			ignore_eof             \
			interactive_comments   \
		 NO_list_ambiguous         \
			local_options          \
			local_traps            \
			long_list_jobs         \
			magic_equal_subst      \
			null_glob              \
			path_dirs              \
			posix_builtins         \
			print_eight_bit        \
			pushd_ignore_dups      \
			pushd_minus            \
			pushd_to_home          \
			rc_expand_param        \
		 NO_sh_in_stdin            \
			share_history          \


I appreciate your help very much.
