Subject: Memory access bug with negative subscripts
To: zsh-workers@sunsite.dk
Message-id: <070724215222.ZM4902@torch.brasslantern.com>

This bug appears at least as far back as zsh 3.0.5, and probably longer
ago.  Still happens in the latest CVS co from SourceForge.

x=x
x[-10]=y
print $x

I can't predict what you'll see, but unless you get very lucky it won't
be what you ought to see.  For example,

torch% x[-$RANDOM]=z
torch% print $x
zpasswd

I imagine running that under ElectricFence or some similar memory checker
would be instructive.
