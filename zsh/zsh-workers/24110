On the assumption that (i) only the original system packages are likely
to put the header in /usr/include (ii) added packages will put it in
some local subdirectory as ncurses/ncurses.h (iii) the added packages
should take preference and some attempt with include paths and library
paths has been made for this, then you're right.  That's a little too
complicated for me to have much faith that it's always going to work,
but at least you've provided one example where it does.
