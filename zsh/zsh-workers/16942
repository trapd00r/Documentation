It seems to be this simple to fix all these problems.  I think the test
for a non-zero-length match was to try and avoid possible problems
caused by infinite loops, but I don't see anything that would cause
infinite loops.  The parameter tests still pass (other forms of pattern
matching aren't affected).

This could probably go in 4.0, I suppose.
