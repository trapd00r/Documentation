i'm running the latest and greatest zsh from freebsd's ports, 4.3.10, and 
there's no completion function for "zargs".

i've cobbled this together - http://smasher.org/tmp/_zargs.gz

i think it's not a bad start, it basically works, but i'm confident that 
there's room for improvement. if anyone wants to, feel free to tune it up 
and submit it for distribution with zsh.
