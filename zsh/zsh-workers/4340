The above change fixes the echotc problem.  While doing this change, I
noticed a 'core' file in the root directory.  It is from 'conftest'.
which is generated by 'configure'.  Any trick to debug 'configure'?

I also got:

       zsh: bad math expression: unbalanced stack

when I tried the basic <TAB> on any directory.  I guess this might be
related to the conftest failure.

Thanks..
