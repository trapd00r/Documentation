} "typeset -U" works for arrays, and so works for path.  Unfortunately,
} it doesn't work with (for example) LD_LIBRARY_PATH, which is a
} colon-separated list.  Annoying: this really needs configurableness.

Is there any difference (internally) between a plain array variable and
a colon-array, other than the set/get functions?  If not, it should be
pretty trivial to make colon-arrays a typeset-able parameter type.
