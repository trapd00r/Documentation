} I meant "since XOrg installs everything into /usr/ instead of
} /usr/X11Rn/".  And this only works (correct me if I'm wrong)
} when command appears with full path.

OK, you're wrong. :-)

Patterns for compdef -P apply to the location of the command after
looking it up in the command hash table.

Nevertheless, I think the existence of /usr/X11R*/ is dependent on the
OS distribution rather than on XOrg.  If you can suggest a way to
distinguish XOrg applications from everything else in /usr/bin on
platforms that don't use a separate tree, I'm sure we'd be happy to
fold that in.
