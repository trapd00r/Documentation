Greetings -

Can anyone show me some nifty zsh hackery to convert a string
representing an absolute path into a relative path?  For example, if
my current $PWD is "/opt/build" and the path I want to convert is
"/opt/src/perl-5.6.1", I would like the result to be
"../src/perl-5.6.1".

Thanks in advance,
  Vin Shelton
