Mikael and Peter -- you're right, that *does* suit my purposes... I don't even have to press <tab>. Thank you.


To the mailing list:

However, if anyone has any autocompletion tutorial resource URL to share, it would be appreciated.

For example, an idea I just had:
How would one have the pattern "#dir" (perhaps defined via a regex) autocomplete using tab, invoking a script with the match (e.g. $ myAutoComp.py dir), which returns a newline-delimited list of possible completions to feed into the completion engine?
This could be used in conjunction with a script which returns (from a hashmap) all directories N levels deep from your home directory -- saving lots of time if you're often looking for a uniquely-named subfolders.

Thank you,
Mats

(sidenote: I'm more interested in the specific technique of interfacing with an outside script, rather than the end result.)
