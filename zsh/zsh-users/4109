There are two widely-used hierarchy delimiters, dot and slash.  Generally
servers that present a usenet-news-style hierarchy use dot, and those that
expose the filesystem hierarchy use slash.

But in reality, the hierarchy delimiter is reported by the server as part
of the protocol exchange with the client, so the only way to know how to
interpret a mailbox name is to actually use the protocol.

It's entirely possible that there are other systems using it.  I'd just
never heard of it before.
