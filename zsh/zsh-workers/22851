Hi,
when I try to launch an init script with argument force-reload,=20
completion is broken. ex:

/etc/init.d/kdm forc
<TAB>
/etc/init.d/kdm forcereload

(instead of force-reload).

_initd completion script has a list of possible arguments, finds=20
matching lines and deletes everything except : [^a-z_]
It finds "force-reload" well, but then removes the dash in that token.
When using [^-a-z_], problem seems to be solved.

Here is my solution as a patch
arno
