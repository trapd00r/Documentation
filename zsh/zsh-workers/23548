Subject: zsh stable release, or is 4.3.4 stable enough for Fedora?

Hello,

Is there any plan of releasing a new "stable" release of zsh in the
near future? Or the stable/unstable convention isn't being used
anymore?

I'm asking this because Fedora is holding to update zsh package (today
it's 4.2.6, from 2005-12-05) because 4.3.x versions are considered
unstable. On the other hand updating would be very useful because of
Unicode stuff in newer zsh. Maybe it would be fine to Fedora update to
4.3.4? Ubuntu have been using 4.3.x since last year.

There are some bug reports related to this discussion:

Cheers,
