No, that's not how it works. It's just that in some terminals (the Linux
console for example, at least with some keymaps) Alt-. produces ESC-.
But this is by no means standard. In my Xterm, when I press Alt-. I get
the (R) registered trademark sign and if I want to bind something to Alt-.
I have to bind it to (R) to work in Xterm. The simplest way to find out
what to bind against is to execute

  cat

and then press the key combo in question and look at what you see on
screen. On the linux console I get this (with Alt-.)

PS1# cat
^[.


and ^[ happens to be ESC.
