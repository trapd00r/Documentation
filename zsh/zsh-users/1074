thanks peter, for answering the question about the ability
to do what i want in 3.1

i still use 3.0 so i have to wait for 3.1 to be released.

the other thing that i am missing is control-x ( as i wrote before.

sorry for posting my questions again. i thought, they did not reach
the list and i am getting so much mail that i missed peters nice
answer at first sight!

by the way, i am planning to do a german zsh-page which does describe
the beauty of the zsh to germans.

i hope that will advertize for good.
the zsh does not get too much advertizing.
i really don't know why that is.
but it really, really deserves it!

 thans to the fine authors and all programmers involved in making
 unix-life much, much more fun!
