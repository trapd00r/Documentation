I've got some recollection of making zsh width restricted by COLUMNS.
i.e. you can have an 80 column window and say COLUMNS=20.  And back then
everything would have been fine (on every system but one Irix one, I think)
as I did some magic automargin thingy, which displayed the correct stuff
on both automargin and non-automargin terms.  Except, xterm's couldn't 
do proper cut'n'paste using that trick so that got taken out.  Nowadays
if you do COLUMNS=20 on an 80 column window and your 80 column window
has automargin, then you'll lose out.
Anyway, just injecting a bit of programming history into this.
