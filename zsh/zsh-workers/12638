Ehh but if I understand it correctly, in case of

sudo kill TAB

$words is modified to be just (kill), removing sudo and any of it's option? In
more general case

sudo -u foo kill TAB

it would be nice to know that we are su'ing to user foo and not to root.

The problem is, I need this information not when completing sudo but when
completing command after sudo.
