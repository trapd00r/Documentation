Oops, I did not know that the text pasted is to be patched. I am having
tough time figuring out how to patch the _path_files file. I copied the text
between the lines

  diff -u -r1.27 _path_files

and

testpath="$donepath"

to a file and fed that file patch command. patch failed, I tried with
several other combinations of input to patch, deleted the first one line
first, next second, but nothing worked.

Please explain me how to patch this file. I know this is a stupid question,
but I need help...
