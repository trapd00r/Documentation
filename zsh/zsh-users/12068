The file names are valid - perhaps I should have said that I've changed
the cygdrive prefix to "/" with `mount -c'.

Completion also fails if I use `cd /c/<TAB>' after I've `setopt
nocaseglob' and works if I `setopt caseglob'.

This looks to me to be a zsh bug that's been introduced in the last year
or so.

Those are not valid filenames under cygwin.  You can use /cygdrive/c
(or /c if you mount c:/ there), but c:/ is not a posix-compatible
filename.  It may have worked in the past, but it was by accident, not
by design.  If you want more details, you can search the archives of
the cygwin mailing list.

HTH,
  Vin
