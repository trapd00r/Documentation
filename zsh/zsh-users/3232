it is at least better than nothing. I took the `mpage -dp'
approach and so was able to reduce the size so it nearly was a
card again. A big one, but what does one expect of a ZSH
reference card ? :)

But consider your marvelous user guide and it's _hundreds_ of pages
when it will be finished. THATS the difference. 
When I consider that and the big, big manual pages which have
20878 lines I guess there is no other chance for an overview.
Okay they have lots of "\n" inside.
 `man zshall | col -b | tr -s "\n" | wc -l' gets me : 14576
 (Is there anybody that loves to do tr -s "\n" in this case? :) )

So i guess it remains to be _necessary_ even if it is no guide.

Matthias
