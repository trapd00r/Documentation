} 
} - What happened to the patch 4447 (from Bart) that was supposed to make
} 3.0.5 believe SIGWINCH signals?  Shouldn't that be in 3.0.6?

What happened to it was that I never applied it to my local copy of zsh
because I wasn't having the problem it fixed, and I was at that time
leaving it up to Zefram to decide whether to include patches in the
official versions.  Consequently, I missed it when making up the -pre-X
patches.

I'll get it into -pre-3, as it looks like there needs to be one more
round of testing anyway.

} - Where did the code change between 3.0 and 3.1 originate anyway (and why)?

As best I can tell, the change was put into 3.0 after the split for 3.1
and then simply never propagated into 3.1.  Cf. zsh-workers 4919, 5301.

} It's all mixed in with little changes like moving the
} definitions of the LINES and COLUMNS variables from hashtable.h to
} params.c.

I suspect that's why Zoltan and/or Zefram never got around to duplicating
this and other changes.
