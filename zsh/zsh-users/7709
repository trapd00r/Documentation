That doesn't work do what he wants; send-break discards the search text,
so, e.g., you can't resume searching for the same thing again later by
pressing the history-incremental-search-backward binding twice in a row.

This on the other hand does have the effect of saving the search text.  
So the closest you can get to having both is to invoke end-of-history; but 
that's not normally bound to anything, so you have to create a binding for 
it first.
