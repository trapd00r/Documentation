entire?  is that important?

i had no idea what you were talking about, because compinit said command not found, but eventually tried this:

                autoload -U compinit
                compinit
                _comp_options+=(globdots)

now it doesn't complete symlinks even when the symlinks are partly typed.  what i want is all files to be completed except . .., without affecting glob expansion.

fwiw, i use zsh mainly because bash has interrupt behavior that doesn't work the way i expect, and it's too much effort to try to figure out if bash can be fixed.  i *always* script to the intersection of the two shells and, for now, use bash for most scripts.  zsh users do seem to be friendly, which i like.  i will give up on this if it requires more typing (rsi).

thanks very much for your reply.
