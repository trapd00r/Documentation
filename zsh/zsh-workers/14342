If I type a command such as

echo ${(M)${(f)"$(<listofthings)"}:#*subthing*}

Then invoke list-expand, the appropriate expansion will be displayed,
and the command line will change to

echo ${(M)${(f)$(<listofthings)}:#*subthing*}

That is, the double quotes disappear, and I become very perplexed
and aggravated until I notice this.
