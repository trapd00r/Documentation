} A4) What's the latest version?
} 
}   The release of zsh 3.0 is imminent; currently 3.0-pre3 is available.
} 
}   Note that even numbered minor versions are not released.

Um, 3.0 is an even-numbered minor version.  Are we revising this policy?

} B2) Similarities with csh
} 
}     Alternative syntax `if ( ... ) ...' (also `for', `which'; this now
}       requires the CSH_JUNKIE_PAREN option).

True only for 2.5.xx and some 2.6.xx.  CSH_JUNKIE_PAREN is gone again in
3.0, as you mentioned later.  However, you should probably point out that
`if ( ... ) ...' doesn't work like csh, it just looks like csh.  One still
has to replace the ( ) with [[ ]] in most csh-conversion cases.
