I didn't mean to neglect this, but I was whisked away on a sudden

e-mail before returning to civilization.

I think this might be more useful if there were a way to build modules
without the zsh sources (such as a library, header files, and possibly
some site-specific configuration data).

No, it doesn't, and I can only theorize on how to test for such a
condition, since I doubt I have access to any such platforms.
