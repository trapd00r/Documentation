    Hi all, specially Bart :)

    Just one thing: some braindead spam filter has listed me because
my ISP has not an rDNS entry for me, namely 'xbl.selwerd.cx', so I
cannot send carbon copies and the like to you, Bart. So don't think I
forget about you in a conversation, it is just that I cannot send you
an email due to things like 'blackholes.five-ten-sg.com' who thinks
that I'm an spammer for not having reverse DNS entries for my home
system...

    Raúl
