My big problem is with inputting characters from the keyboard: I have
the Euro and pound sterling, but if you have only ASCII character that
could be difficult.  The pound (what I call pound, not what I call hash)
is 0xc2 0xa3 in UTF-8.  It ought to be possible to convince xterm into
inserting it with some translations trickery:

XTerm*VT100.Translations: #override \
Shift <KeyPress> F9: string(0xc2) string(0xa3)

did the trick (I tried that under Linux where I know the pound sign
works).

Yes, this is the langinfo.h problem.  I think this is fixed by the patch
in zsh-workers/22085.
