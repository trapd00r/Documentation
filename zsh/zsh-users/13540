That's rather interesting (since 4.3.9 *is* 4.3.x :-), but I haven't
found that particular post (yet).  I've checked the patches posted since
4.3.9 and I don't see anything particularly geared for this problem
(unless it's hiding under the guise of the "BeOS port" or one of the
memory leak fixes :-).  I'm about to go trolling through the mail
archives and if that doesn't enlighten me, I'll go grab from cvs and see
what's different.
