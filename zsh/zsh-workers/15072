[just an amusing, off-topic, tidbit. feel free to ignore]

Today I accidentally stumbled across the ".SH" ccTLD. Just for fun I
decided to check, and what do you know,

	zee.sh
and
	zsh.sh

are free :)

So if anybody wants to blow some money on the government of Saint Helena (or
some company that runs it for them...), check out http://nic.sh/ (or some
reseller like register.com). But act quickly - bourne.sh, bash.sh, csh.sh,
ksh.sh and unix.sh are all already taken ;)
