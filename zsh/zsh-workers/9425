Subject: zsh on Cygwin?
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Hi,
I'm new to this list, and although I have checked the archive
of this list, forgive me if this is a FAQ...

I have tried to build zsh3.1.6 on Cygwin (on WinNT4).
With the (well known) fix to builtin.c (__CYGWIN ==> __CYGWIN__),
zsh.exe can be build but does not function well.

The problem is:

Suppose I have a file 'junk.dat' and want to remove it.
If I type

	zsh% rm -i jun<TAB>

then zsh completes the line to

	zsh% rm -i junk.dat

Now I type <RETURN>, and rm command asks

	rm: remove `junk.dat'?

but the console does not accept any key input.

Not only 'y' or 'n', but any of ^C, ^Z, ^M, ... do nothing.
The only thing I can do is to kill the console window (and zsh).

If I do not use the filename completion, and type the whole
command line 'rm -i junk.dat' by myself, then there is no
problem except for that the next prompt from zsh does not
go to the next line but overwrite the 'rm: remove ...?' line.

Does anybody experience the same problem?

I built the zsh3.1.6 with gcc.2.95.2 on Cygwin-b20.1
by just typing ./configure and make.
Invoking zsh as 'zsh -f' not helps.
