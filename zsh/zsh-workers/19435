It's probably a case of missing headers.  It wouldn't link, or would fail
to load with an error message, if you didn't have the functions; there's
no obvious way it could hang.  In RedHat 9 and Solaris 8 the headers are
in stdlib.h (and they're certainly to hand in the other two Linux systems
I tried at home).

I'm not sure how to test for this.  Maybe it would be enough to try
compiling and linking a programme with grantpt etc., since I think
configure is sensitive to compiler warnings.
