} If you need an external editor, it doesn't look like fc will help

If you know in advance that you're going to want to do this, invoke
fc *first*, then run the "find" or whatever from inside your editor to
capture the output, and edit it into commands as you will.

You can even do this afterwards if you're willing to wait for the "find"
to run again.

Or you can do this:

    FINDOUT=/usr/tmp/find.$$
    find() {
	command find $* | tee $FINDOUT
    }

Then every time you run "find" the output gets captured for you, and you
can "vi $FINDOUT" or whatever to edit it into commands.

If you don't anticipate running finds that generate megabytes of output,
you can use:

    find() {
	FIND="$(command find $*)"
	echo "$FIND"
    }

Then "vared FIND" works, etc.
