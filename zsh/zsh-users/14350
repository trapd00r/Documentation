Since you=92re asking for the simplest way I have to come up with this:

   for ls in gls ls; do whence $ls >/dev/null && {alias ls=3D"$ls --=20
color"; break}; done; unset ls

not so cool, but it works and is parseable by humans :)

Besides this it can be easily extended to adopt handling of different =20=

platforms (ls --color on darwin won=92t work). I think this kind of =20
thing needs to be done with less zshisms to be powerful.
