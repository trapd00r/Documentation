    Hi Bart :)

    Sorry, I forgot to tell: Linux, a DIY box running 2.4.21 kernel
with glibc 2.2.4

    Maybe PTY handling is the problem, but if I run the test as you
say, the test is indeed more verbose but hangs anyway :( It stops at:

    comptestinit -z $ZTST_testdir/../Src/zsh &&
    {
        mkdir dir1
        mkdir dir2
        touch file1
        touch file2
    }

    Don't know why 'comptestinit' stops there :??

    BTW, I have /dev/ptmx AND /dev/ptyp? so the test shouldn't fail
even if zsh thinks I don't have the PTY multiplexer :?

    Thanks for your answer :)
