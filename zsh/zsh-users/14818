The problem is that HFS+ stores filenames in Unicode Normalization Form 
D (D = Decomposed).  So, even though this character exists:

é  00e9  LATIN SMALL LETTER E WITH ACUTE

On disk, it's stored as:
e  0065  LATIN SMALL LETTER E
   0301  COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT

That's the diagnosis.  Don't know the cure.
