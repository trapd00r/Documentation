That doesn't really matter, since if the option isn't set, $0 is the shell
name and won't have a / in, so the test fails anyway.  Maybe I'll add an
option to compinit to pass down it's own path for use in the test --- it's
not very useful for ordinary users, but could smooth things with
compinstall.  And I should turn . into $PWD.

Maybe it's worth checking for Core etc. subdirectories at that point and
adding them all to $fpath.  Does anyone have any preferences for where to
install functions, if I ever get round to this?  I had imagined just
putting them all (i.e. including Functions stuff) in one big directory.
