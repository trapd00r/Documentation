Well,  this is  again for  cosmetic  reasons AFAICT  when the  zsh
developer is manually viewing the results of the sed command.  But
this causes  problems when file  has tabs instead of  spaces, then
you don't have completion anymore.   So either remove leading " *"
(preferred) or specify  the character class :blank: to  be sure to
match all blanks.  The XML spec does not require blanks before the
tag.  About anything could appear there.

Best regards,
