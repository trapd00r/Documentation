A bigger problem (IMO) than worrying about odd sh compatibilities when
using (trying to use) zsh as /bin/sh under Linux, is all the
dependancies on Bash featurisms, since bash is the /bin/sh on most
Linux systems.

No, I don't know any particulars -- I've just heard the folks on IRC
bitch from time to time that this-and-such package (written on Linux)
says #!/bin/sh and needs bash.

OTOH, I've been using zsh (dynamically linked, but in /sbin) as root's
shell for quite some time.  Since the /bin/sh that account had
formerly was also dynamically linked, I don't feel like I lost any
safety net...
