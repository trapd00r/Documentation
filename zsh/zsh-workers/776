zsh v. 2.6-beta13 on HP-UX A.09.01
zsh v. 2.6-beta13 on SunOS 5.4

When I do the following:

% ls &
[1] 12742
%
[1]  + 12742 suspended (tty output)  ls
% fg
[1]  + continued  ls


my eof stty binding gets changed from ^D to ^A.
The annoying thing is then, when I try to exit with ^D, I get
zsh: do you wish to see all 2345 possibilities? 

I really don't want to see all 2345 possibilities. 8-)
