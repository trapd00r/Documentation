Hey ho! Now I'm not alone! :-)))

Yes, all prerequisites are  implemented in current CVS. What is missing, is
the widget/key binding itself, but if you use example from docs verbatim, it
works. I've tried it and I confirm it.

If you have suggestions what this _insert_all_matches should do - you are
welcome. The difference between example and my version is that in my version
you could hit ^Xi - and if there was no list, it called normal completion. Is
this interesting? Example from docs will work only after existing list has
already been generated.
