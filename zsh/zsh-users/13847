It's actually INTERACTIVE_COMMENTS. I was too lazy to type it out.
Less's -p option just wants a pattern to search for, so that was
enough. :-)

Well, I'd guess it's been done to let people use the hash char without
needing to quote it. After all, who really uses comments in
interactive mode? (yeah, I know some people do. But they can just use
said option.)

Not that I would know, why?
