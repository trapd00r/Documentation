Geoff Wing <gcw@zsh.org> typed:
: I think it should abort in a couple of cases:
: a) when run as root.  root should probably have to make his/her own changes
:    manually (though maybe other people would think otherwise)
: b) when we don't have write access to the HOME directory, say, after an su

Currently, for "b)", I get the effect of "which zsh-newuser-install" to the
screen twice.

Regards,
Geoff
