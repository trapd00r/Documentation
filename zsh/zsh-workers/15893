You're right, that's the obvious thing to use.  The third argument to
require_module appears not to do anything, however.

One very minor issue with loading a module at that point is that it appears
after the module you're actually requesting (i.e. zsh/zftp) in the list of
modules produced by zmodload, which is slightly illogical.
