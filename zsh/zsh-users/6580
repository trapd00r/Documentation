This sort of correction (unlike that in the completion system) is
actually based on the keyboard layout; that's why there's an option
DVORAK to use the Dvorak keyboard.   Hence it decides `k' isn't near
enough to `p' for you to have meant that, whereas you might (without
reference to the keyboard) have missed out a letter or transposed a
couple.

There's a long-standing wish that you could use completion-style
correction at this point, but it's a lot of work.  With Sven absent,
it's not even clear there's anyone capable of doing it at the moment.
