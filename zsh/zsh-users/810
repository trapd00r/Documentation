I think zsh's method for startup files is the most logical
of all the common shells.

.zshenv  -- invoked on every startup
.zshrc   -- invoked for interactive shells
.zlogin  -- invoked for login shells
.zlogout -- invoked on logout

This give you complete flexibility.  I wouldn't want all
that stuff in a single file.  Of course you need to might
sure things are in the right file, but you only need to
do that once.
