After thinking more about this: for this example the test
`(( -rangebeg(s1,s2) ))' should already be enough. For other tests we
could just add some helpful functions, e.g. `prefix(s1,s2)' which
returns the length of the common prefix of both strings and so
on. Such functions may be helpful in writing shell functions that do
matching anyway and with a good set of such functions we could put all 
tests together in one `(( ... ))'.

 Sven
