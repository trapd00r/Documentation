I think the problem isn't understanding of conditional expressions, it's
that '#' normally starts a comment, so you have to quote it.

The "trick" is to quote ONLY the '#' character and not the rest of the
pattern.  Hence Hannu's solution is the most concise, but these work:

	[[ $YOURSTRING == '#'* ]]

	[[ $YOURSTRING == "#"* ]]

String concatenation in shell language is by simple juxtaposition, no
operator required.

This works, too, by forcing the '#' to be treated as part of a pattern:

	[[ $YOURSTRING == (#)* ]]
