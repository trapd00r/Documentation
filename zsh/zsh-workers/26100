Hi all,

quite often, I wish I could use the output of a completion function
on the comand line. Think

  my_list=$(magic_function(apt-get install openoffice-<tab>))

The completion functions are so powerful it's a shame not to use
their output for more purposes.

Bart(?) told me this would not be an easy thing to do so I think
it makes sense to implement this through a shell feature or not
at all.


Thoughts, feedback, suggestions?
Richard
