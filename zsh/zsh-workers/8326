In concept, if not in execution, I suppose ...

} I needed the following patch in order to successfully compile on AIX
} 3.2.5. I'm not totally sure that this is the correct fix but the
} .export files don't seem to be auto-generated anywhere

No, the .export files are an undocumented bit of module-ness:  If a
module defines any C symbols (except those for normal autoloading) that
other modules might need to see, those have to be listed in the .export
for a certain class of dynamic loading schemes; that file is passed to
the $(DLLINK) program when building the shared object.

If anyone remembers the exact details, please add something about it to
Etc/zsh-development-guide.  Perhaps it *could* be auto-generated using
a variant of the makepro.awk script?
