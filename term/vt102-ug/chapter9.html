<H1 ID="S9"><SPAN CLASS="chapnum">9</SPAN> Maintenance and Troubleshooting</H1>
<H2 ID="S9.1">General</H2>
<P>This chapter describes maintenance procedures, troubleshooting (what to
do in the event of a problem), and self-tests used with the VT102. You
should troubleshoot the terminal before requesting service.</P>
<H2 ID="S9.2">Maintenance</H2>
<P>The terminal does not need preventive maintenance. However, you can
clean terminal and screen surfaces with any mild detergent that does not
use solvents; apply the detergent with a cloth or tissue. To clean the
keys, rub with a dry or moist cloth.</P>
<P CLASS="note">CAUTION: Do not use too much detergent when cleaning the terminal.
Liquids can damage the inside of the terminal. Do not remove the keycaps
when cleaning; you can damage the keyswitch contacts by replacing
the keycaps incorrectly.</P>
<H2 ID="S9.3">Troubleshooting</H2>
<P>If you suspect a problem with the terminal, check <A HREF="table9-1.html">Table 9-1</A> to see if the
symptoms are there. If the problem is not listed in <A HREF="table9-1.html">Table 9-1</A>, use the following
procedure:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Turn the power switch off (0) (<A HREF="figure9-1.html">Figure 9-1</A>).</LI>
<LI>Check the following items.
<P><EM>Voltage selection switch and fuse.</EM> Make sure the switch is in the
correct position. Select 120 volts by performing the following procedure.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Set the voltage selection switch to 115 (operating voltage range
99 to 128 Vac). On some terminals, the setting is 100 (operating range 87-107 Vac).</LI>
<LI>Remove the fuse holder cap by pressing in and turning counter-clockwise.
Check for a 1.25 A fuse (DIGITAL PN 90-0020-01) and
make sure the wire in the fuse is not broken.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Select 220-240 volts by performing the following procedure.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Set the voltage selection switch to 230 (operating voltage range 198 to 256 Vac). On some terminals, the setting is 250 (operating range 222-268 Vac).</LI>
<LI>Remove the fuse holder cap by pressing in and turning counter-clockwise.
Check for a 0.75 A slow blow fuse (DIGITAL PN 12-11237-00)
and make sure the wire in the fuse is not broken.</LI>
</OL>
<P><EM>Power cord.</EM> Make sure the cord is connected securely at both the
terminal and the wall outlet. Check ac power at the wall outlet with
another device such as a lamp.</P>
<P><EM>Keyboard coiled cord.</EM> Make sure the cord is securely plugged into
the keyboard connector at the back of the terminal.</P></LI>
<LI>Perform all the tests in the following section.</LI>
</OL>
<H2 ID="S9.4">Self-Tests</H2>
<P>The terminal uses self-tests to verify operation. The self-tests provided
are a power-up self-test, three loopback self-tests, and a printer test. The
power-up self-test runs each time the terminal is powered up. The loopback
self-tests may run after the power-up self-test ends; these self-tests
need an optional loopback test connector. The printer test ensures that
the terminal and printer can communicate.</P>
<H3 ID="S9.4.1">Power-Up Self Test</H3>
<P>A power-up self-test runs each time you turn the power on (power up).
The test checks general terminal operation, user memory (holding SET-UP
features), and the keyboard. Perform the power-up self-test by using
the following procedure.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Start the power-up self-test in one of the following ways.
<UL>
<LI>Turn the power switch to on (1) (<A HREF="figure9-1.html">Figure 9-1</A>).</LI>
<LI>If power is on, press <SPAN CLASS="keyname">SET-UP</SPAN> and then <SPAN CLASS="keyname">RESET</SPAN>.</LI>
<LI>If power is on, type one of the following sequences. The terminal
must be off-line with the ANSI/VT52 SET-UP feature set to ANSI
(SET-UP B switch 2-3 = 1).

<LI>The terminal displays test data, the wait message, then erases
the screen. (The test data and wait message are not visible if the
terminal is not warmed up).</LI>
<LI>All keyboard indicators turn on and off, and either the ON LINE or
OFF LINE stay on.
<P CLASS="note">NOTE: The on or off state of other keyboard indicators depends
on received modem signals and feature selections.</P></LI>

of the following indications.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Does not perform the above sequence.</LI>
<LI>Displays character at the cursor position.</LI>
<LI>Sounds several bell tones.</LI>
</UL>
<P>There are two failures that allow the terminal operation to continue: a
user memory failure indicated by a 2 on the screen and several bell
tones, and a keyboard failure indicated by a 4 on the screen. The
user memory failure allows continued operation after you select SET-UP
features in operating memory. The keyboard failure allows the
terminal to continue to operate as a receive-only terminal.</P></LI>
<LI>After a single test, enter SET-UP to verify a successful test. A SET-UP
A display should appear on the screen. If not, call your local
DIGITAL Field Service Office.</LI>
</OL>
<H3 ID="S9.4.2">Data Loopback Self-Test</H3>
<P>The data loopback self-test verifies that the terminal can transmit and receive
characters. You must connect the transmit and receive lines to
each other with the EIA loopback connector (DIGITAL PN 12-15336) available
from the DIGITAL Accessories and Supplies Group (<A HREF="chapter10.html">Chapter 10</A>). The
terminal transmits characters on the transmit line and receives the characters
on the receive line. Perform the data loopback self-test by using
the following procedure.</P>
<P CLASS="note">NOTE: See <A HREF="chapter8.html">Chapter 8</A> to perform the data loopback self-test with the
20 mA current loop option (VT1XX-CA) installed.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Turn the power switch off (0).</LI>
<LI>Unplug the communication cable and install the EIA loopback connector
on the modem connector (<A HREF="figure9-2.html">Figure 9-2</A>).</LI>
<LI>The internal communication switch S6 must be on (closed) to perform
this test. If the switch is off (open), remove the access cover,
turn the switch on (closed), and install the access cover. See  <A HREF="chapter7.html#S7.5.1">Internal
Communication Switch Selection</A> in <A HREF="chapter7.html">Chapter 7</A> for details.
<P CLASS="note">NOTE: Usually, this switch is only open when you set the modem
control SET-UP feature for asymmetric full-duplex (FDX C).</P></LI>
<LI>Turn the power switch on (1). The terminal performs the power-up
self-test.</LI>
<LI>Type one of the following sequences to perform the data loopback
self-test. The terminal must be off-line with the ANSI/VT52 SET-UP
feature set to ANSI (SET-UP B switch 2-3 = 1).
