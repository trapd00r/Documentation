Seeing as all this CVS stuff seems to be approaching being
semi-official. Could someone who understands it all please write a
mini-readme to stick in the zsh distribution (or addition to the FAQ)
which lists all the various cvs mirrors and how someone like me who has
never used cvs can extract a copy of the latest version of zsh from it.

Thanks (and sorry for being too lazy to read the cvs manual)

Oliver
