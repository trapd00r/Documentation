Can you explain what you mean?  Because your test case works exactly
as it should in zsh:

% ./testcase
V1=v1 v2
V2=v1
V2=v2

(I note that your test case explicitly requested zsh, not bourne-shell
compatibility mode.)

If you wanted the first loop to split VAR on spaces, in zsh you need
to request that (when SH_WORD_SPLIT is not enabled):

for V in ${=VAR}; do
  echo V1=$V
done

..wayne..
