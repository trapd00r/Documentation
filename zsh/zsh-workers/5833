I wasn't suggesting that!  I agree absolutely that administrators
should consider carefully what, if anything, should go into /etc/z*.

Right, that all looks sensible.  I still like the idea of installing
scripts into $prefix/share or something, and defining a convenience
variable that points at them.  

If nobody beats me to it, I may make a patch for that.  Would it be
helpful if I wrote an RPM spec file?  (I have no experience whatsoever
in doing this, but I've been reading about it recently.)
