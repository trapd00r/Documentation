RE: suspended (tty output)

I thought I recalled this a while ago and thought it was addressed. 
Faulty memory I guess.

Does this ring a bell with anyone. Running something and redirecting 
stdout/err to a file sometimes causes 'suspended (tty output)'

% echo $ZSH_VERSION
2.6-beta17

% make lib.debug > log 2>&1 &
[1] 23847
%
[1]  + 23847 suspended (tty output)  make lib.debug > log 2>&1

% fg
[1]  + continued  make lib.debug > log 2>&1


(process is now uninteruptable via ^Z (STOP) but can be interupted with
^C (INT)).

Platform: 
HP-UX coral A.09.01 A 9000/735 2015828356 two-user license



Now it does not always happen, for example this works fine:
% cat < foo > goo 2>&1 &
[1] 9337
% 
[1]  + 9337 done       cat < foo > goo 2>&1

Could be something other than zsh at fault ?
