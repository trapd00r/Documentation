Subject: ChangeLog was messed up at some point
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

I just did a "cvs update" and discovered that a merge conflict had been
improperly resolved at some point recently.  This resulted in at least
duplication of a lot of ChangeLog entries; it may have caused lossage
that I wasn't able to detect.  I fixed it up as best I was able and have
committed the result, but anyone who has made a change in the last few
days should look through to see if your log entries are missing.
