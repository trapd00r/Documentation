Let's not do that, shall we?  Let's stick with autoload and have a file
suffix convention, like emacs' .el and .elc, or something.  Heck, there
could even be separate fpath and compiled_fpath or ...

Do we really want to go down the road of having e.g. zmodload in one
zsh suddenly make new builtins available to another zsh?  I don't want
the behavior of a script that's running in the background to change
because of something I loaded into my foreground shell ...
