This is my fault; as I noted to Frank when I supplied it, I've only ever
used P4 in this one environment, which is *very* heavily customised, and
frankly don't know what's normal and what isn't.  I offered something
minimal which works for me.

I am in no way wedded to the existing P4 support, but I simply don't
know enough to provide better.
