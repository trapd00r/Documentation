It's hard to tell, but we can certainly say it's got *something* to do
with the way your terminal behaves.  I don't recognise those escape
sequences, but the fact that changing them makes a difference suggests
the terminal is doing something weird with the output.

You didn't say what system you're on: if it's a MAC, somebody reported a
similar problem recently.  See the thread at
