It would be very nice to add this as a feature! Do you know what is the proper 
procedure to request it to developers?

I really use that feature in bash; sometimes I forgot to add the space in 
sensitive commands that I don't want to appear in the history (like typing 
passwords). Nevertheless, it's a small inconvenience in comparison with all 
the benefits I get from zsh :)

Toshiro.
