OK, is it the same thing as rup >>(hilight 1) ?

(I'm reading mails from 1998, and either things have changed or there
are not very clear.)

The problem is that rup does block-buffering. Neither a pipe nor >(...)
prevents it to do so. Is there a way (at the shell level) so that rup
thinks it's writing to a terminal (thus does line-buffering)?
