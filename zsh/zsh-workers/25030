hmm..
in root's path /sbin states before /bin
so if i have two modprobes (in /bin and in /sbin) zsh will list modules
with /bin/modprobe, while /sbin/modprobe will really executed by sudo

i can't find any logic where zsh search command to complete after sudo
(when i type sudo <TAB>)
may be it will be more correctly to make some changes in sudo completion?

I'm newbie in zsh ): I don't understand this lines..
