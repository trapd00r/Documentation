} You've got two choices:  history-beginning-search-backward (which searches
} for what's behind the cursor) and history-search-backward (which searches
} for the first word no matter where the cursor is).

Also predictive typing (see "info --index-search=predict zsh" or
"man zshcontrib").  With that you probably want to set some styles, so
also search through that manual section for ":predict" and look at the
possibilities.  In particular you probably want to limit the set of
completers that are used for prediction.
