list, not info.  We made some performance improvements as of build 94.
"pkg list" now takes about two seconds on my machine, and "pkg list -a"
takes about three.  It could be faster, certainly, but for a first-time
startup cost, it's not bad at all, though certainly running it every time
would be pretty painful.  And in the next build or two, there'll be a
history command that will let you safely determine whether the cache is
invalid.

Hey, it's a good start!

Thanks,
