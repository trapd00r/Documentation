I'm having a problem with version 3.0.1.  It may have existed in previous
versions as well.

In all of my login shells (local or remote), the command line editor
doesn't work.  If I hit the ESC key, nothing happens.  If I type zsh
in the login shell, command line editing starts working again.
Here's the list of options I have set:
autocd
autolist
automenu
autopushd
cdablevars
chaselinks
correct
cshnullglob
extendedglob
histnostore
nohup
ignoreeof
interactive
listtypes
monitor
pushdminus
pushdsilent
pushdtohome
shinstdin
zle

I'm running on Solaris 2.4.

Please email any responses to me directly since I'm not on any
of the zsh mailing lists.

Thanks,

+james+
