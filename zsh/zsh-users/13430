Looks OK to me... in particular, you're using "compinit" without which
the ignored-patterns method wouldn't work.  I tried it from scratch to
make sure and it worked for me.

One point is that if you have *only* .fasl files, a later completion
pass will put those back in.  To stop that,

  zstyle ':completion:*' completer _complete

(the default is equivalent to adding "_ignored" to the end).  However,
usually the default behaviour is harmless and occasionally useful.

Yes, those shouldn't have any adverse effect.
