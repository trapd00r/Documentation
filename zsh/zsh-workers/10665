} Several problems show up in this snapshot:

} 1) -disable-dynamic no longer works, modules always seem to be enabled.

You didn't have this problem with -dev-21 ?  There haven't been any
interesting changes to the build process in a very long time, except
maybe my patch in 10499, but that shouldn't affect AIX specially.

Are you using the FTP snapshots, or the SourceForge CVS repository?  If
the latter, did you remember to run Util/preconfig before making?

Did you start from scratch or were you compiling in a directory where an
earlier version had been built before?

} 2) the GETGPRGP macro should resolve to getpgrp(), not getpgrp(0).

That configure test hasn't changed in a *very* long time.  When was the
last snapshot you built successfully?
