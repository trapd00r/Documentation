} In the case of this function, re-establishing the context is

The problem I was concerned about was this one:

} because if the h-b-s-f fails and the subsequent d-l-o-h does a

}   [[ $RBUFFER = *$'\n'* ]] || return
} before the fi.

So if you've made that change, it shoudl be OK.

} 
} That doesn't help. It also means that the cursor position for
} searches is then fixed forever after for that shell instance.

Not exactly -- __searching will get cleared as soon as a search fails and
a simple up/down motion is done -- but you're right, the test should be
[[ $__searching = *-line-or-search && $LASTWIDGET = *-line-or-search ]]
or something along those lines.

Incidentally, a (possibly better) alternative to saving $CURSOR is to
save $LBUFFER and use it:

	if [[ ... ]]; then
	  __last_search=$LBUFFER
	fi
	zle .history-beginning-search-forward $__last_search

} I think I've got it working now but am not sure why or whether
} there was something peculiar with the history list I had
} yesterday. Do we want to include the cursor movement in
} the examples in the distribution - it is more like up-line-or-
} search? Perhaps we need to use styles to configure it?

Styles are always nice; I'd be inclined to put the cursor movement in
and have a style to turn it off.
