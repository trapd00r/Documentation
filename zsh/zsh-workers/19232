    That's a problem that I have had frequently with this list.
Sometimes I don't receive posts :(( Lately that seemed to be solved
(for me, at least)...

    OK ;))

    I knew that. What I didn't know was that modules weren't loaded
when zsh was invoked as sh. Which, on the other hand, makes sense...

    Does that mean that you can zmodload zsh/rlimits and have again
the builtin?
