This updates the package docs for 4.3.5; let me know if I've missed
anything.  (I don't bother keeping them up to date for intermediate dev
releases.  It's hard enough remembering for real releases and I forgot
for 4.2.7, so I thought I'd better do this now.)

Since 4.3.4 was quite widely deployed I've separated out the NEWS
section for differences within 4.3 for the first time.

It occurs to me it would make sense to put proper release notes
somewhere (other than on the mailing list).

 CHANGES FROM PREVIOUS VERSIONS OF ZSH

+Note also the list of incompatibilities in the README file.
+
+Major changes between versions 4.3.4 and 4.3.5
+----------------------------------------------
+
+- The new extended globbing flag (#cN,M) behaves similarly to the extended
+  regular expression syntax {N,M}.
+
+- The zsh/datetime module has been enhanced and a calendar function
+  system has been added along the lines of (but much enhanced from)
+  the traditional Unix "calendar" utility.  This is still under
+  development.  See the zshcalsys manual.  (The calendar functions
+  were in 4.3.4 but were not listed in this file.  There have been
+  significant enhancements since 4.3.4.)
+
+- A new module zsh/curses provides a builtin zcurses for access to
+  to the curses screen manipulation package.  See the entry for zsh/curses
+  in the zshmodules manual.
+
+- The module system has been enhanced to support the notion of "features"
+  that give more control over which builtins, parameters, conditions
+  and math functions are loaded from a module.  In particular,
+  "zmodload -F zsh/stat b:zstat" makes the builtin previously called
+  "stat" available as "zstat" (only) to avoid clashes with a system
+  command named "stat".
+
+Major changes between versions 4.2 and 4.3.4
+--------------------------------------------
 
 - There is support for multibyte character sets.  This is now reasonably
   close to complete, although Unicode combining characters don't work

+This is version 4.3.5 of the shell.  This is a development release,
 but is believed to be reasonably stable.  Sites where the users need to
 edit command lines with multibyte characters (in particular UTF-8)
 will probably want to upgrade.

   support are now in place, although there is some debugging work
   still to be done.
