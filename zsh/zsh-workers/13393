Wolfgang Friebel was also a zsh fan when I was in Zeuthen --- if he wrote
the article you might persuade him to do one about zsh.

I don't know what relevance `after the colon' has for zsh, but the new
completion system already has this sort of thing built in by default.  Try
completing after `tar xvzf archive.tar.gz ' and you will get the contents,
presented using something very like the standard file-choosing interface.
Did you have something more in mind?
