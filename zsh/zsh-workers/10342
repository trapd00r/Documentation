Yesssss!

I've added zefram as a developer.  Note that developers (there's now
adamspiers, pws, barts, wischnow, zefram) can log in at
zsh.sourceforge.net with the same password as on the web.  Good news!

[pws@orbital pws]$ which zsh
/bin/zsh
[pws@orbital pws]$ chsh
Changing shell for pws.
Password: 
New shell [/bin/bash]: /bin/zsh
Shell changed.
