Subject: bug in patterns used for filename expansion (e.g. a[b/c]d)

zsh 4.3.4 isn't POSIX-compliant concerning filename expansion and
unmatched [. POSIX[*] says:

  For example, the pattern "a[b/c]d" does not match such pathnames as
  abd or a/d. It only matches a pathname of literally a[b/c]d.

[*] http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/utilities/xcu_chap02.html#tag_02_13_03

But with zsh 4.3.4:

prunille% ls a[b/c]d
zsh: no matches found: a[b/c]d

while the file exists (no problem with bash, dash or ksh93). For more
information, see the following thread:
