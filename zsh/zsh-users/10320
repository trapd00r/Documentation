Yes, thank you very much.

The following version also works with IFS="" (I guess it will work
with IFS equal to something sensible too).

mapassign() {
    local h=$1 k=$2 
    shift 2 
    set -- ${(j: :q)*} 
    typeset -gA $h 
    typeset -g $h\[$k\]="$*"
}

Same with this one:

mapread() {
    set -- $1\[$2\]
    reply=( ${(s: :Q)${(z)${(P)1}}} ) 
}

That isn't meant for mailing lists, but for private messages.  I've
modified my tag line a bit, but it's also your prerogative not to
answer.
