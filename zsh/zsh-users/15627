The *old* prompt is redisplayed when the window is resized, but
why not the new prompt (see below)?

15:59:59 was the time the sleep process ended. When I resized the
window at 16:00:03, the prompt contents (as displayed) didn't change.
When I hit [Enter] at 16:00:37, the old prompt was replaced by the
new prompt contents (hence "ypig:~[1]>" changed to "ypig:~[0]>" and
15:59:59 changed to 16:00:03, which was the time of the resize).
