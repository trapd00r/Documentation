I'm kinda confused...  either that, or ppp/slirp is better than I thought....

Basically I'm running linux at home with zsh.  I fire up xwindows, start
ppp, and telnet to the host that slirp is running on.  (slirp gives ppp
access to a normal shell account)  I then procede to try emacs.  This then
gives an error of 'can't open $DISPLAY'.  I then set DISPLAY="" and
everything works as it should.  

Does zsh automatically set the DISPLAY variable?  and if so, how can I turn
it off?  :)  

Thanks;
Jason
