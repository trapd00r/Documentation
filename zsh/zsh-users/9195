Hey thanks a lot. Now that you have helped me, I am going to bother you with one more question. What is the metacharacter that expands to the current list of intelligent completions?  For instance, in cvs, I do cvs add <Tab>, it will show the list of new files, but '*' still expands to all the files in the directory. So is there a metacharacter that expands to the result of the intelligent completion?

Thanks
