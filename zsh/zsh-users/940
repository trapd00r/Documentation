Then edit your .zshrc or /etc/zshrc and add

bindkey -e
bindkey " " up-line-or-history		# up-arrow
bindkey " " down-line-or-history	# down-arrow
bindkey " " forward-char		# right-arrow
bindkey " " backward-char		# left-arrow
         ^ instead of space, put whatever you noted on the command line for
	   each arrow.

The above is for emacs bindings.
If you want vi bindings, change "bindkey -e" to "bindkey -v", and the names are
up-history , down-history , vi-forward-char , vi-backward-char

be either a literal escape or the two characters ^ and [
