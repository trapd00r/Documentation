} Do you want to say that we should change the tests to also look for,
} say, $_compdir/Base/Core and if that exists, add `$_compdir/*/*(/)'?

Either that, or we should fix the docs.  Having it work for the source
tree layout is helpful to developers, I think:  No "make install" before
trying out some change, just set _compdir and let compinstall figure it
out.  However, developers are also likely capable of setting the fpath
manually, so it's not that big a deal.

} [...] since nowadays the comp* functions are in the top-level
} directory itself it didn't seem to make sense to look for certain
} sub-directories of the parent directory of $_compdir. Was I mistaken?

No, that's OK, I just was curious.
