I have the feeling I should have an opinion about this one but it
appears that I haven't. If my setup is anything to go by (58 calls to
zstyle ;-), it *would* simplify some of them, but I normally add new
ones with \M-w\C-y, so...
I offer to write it when you folks decide that we want it. I don't
think I'll offer to make `zstyle -L' print them in this form, though
(but I haven't really thought about how difficult that would be).

Maybe together with the other function cleanup in the completion
system.

I still find our behaviour much more consistent and it gives us both
possibilities. So if at all, I think we should use a option for it
(yet another `emulate ksh' thing).

Sniff.

> 9996		vared keymap

A very simple way would be to just allow users to give a keymap via an 
option that would be used as a `local' keymap the way menu-selection
does it, i.e. all functions but undefined-key in that map override the
definitions in the normally used keymap.
This is the place where I wished Anthony would have found the time to
give us the code for the stuff he told us about in 6938.

Oops. I had forgotten about this one. Does it still happen?

An option? Tested only after the init scripts have been read?

I sent a patch for this in 8721 (at least it solved it for me). And
Peter had a look at and a patch for it when he came back. And since
then the whole node-stuff has been removed (the nodes in question were
the ones used to store executable code).

> 8619		locales and globbing

The last reply to this was 8625 -- and I still think this should be
done with a glob flag or an option and a glob flag. Or something.


And there is also still your FPATH-in-the-environment-and-then-that-if
thing...

Bye
 Sven
