I recently wrote a lengthy message about this.  See

	http://www.zsh.org/cgi-bin/mla/redirect?USERNUMBER=2550

For insert mode, you want

	bindkey -v ... beginning-of-line
	bindkey -v ... end-of-line

and for command mode

	bindkey -a ... beginning-of-line
	bindkey -a ... end-of-line

replacing the "..." above with whatever your HOME and END keys send.
