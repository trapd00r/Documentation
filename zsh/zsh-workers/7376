Ah, right, hadn't thought about patterns (ahem)... "${a%'}" reports
the error.

Hm. Should the proposed new flag apply to those, too, and change the
current behaviour to not report the error or should the current
behaviour of (Q) be changed?
Personally I prefer the first one, but that would require an
incompatible change. (And making the flag turn off errors for
${...%...} and friends and turn it on for (Q) is almost certainly the
wrong way).

Bye
 Sven
