Yes, I made that change.  And I've since come to regret it.  I had planned
on changing it back, but was procrastinating since I'm sure lots of people
would raise hell.

I think it makes more sense for it to be HISTCHARS, since this is consistent
with the case of HISTFILE and HISTSIZE.  I now believe this to be more
important than compatibility with base or csh.

I would suggest we change it back before the release of 3.0.
