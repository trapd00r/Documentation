See section 6.4 of the guide.  These are the options it describes as being
in (or out of) effect *inside* function widgets. It's a little bit out of
date; the complete list (all but the first two defined in the array
_comp_options) is now

  localoptions localtraps glob bareglobqual nullglob rcexpandparam
  extendedglob unset
  NO_markdirs NO_globsubst NO_shwordsplit NO_shglob NO_kshglob
  NO_ksharrays NO_cshnullglob NO_allexport NO_aliases NO_errexit

So they're only relevant when you start to write your own functions for
completion.
