That makes more sense now. Not sure I'd describe it as "vastly
different". It would only affect fairly unusual cases.

Do you really think it's worth keeping both syntaxes though given that
it'd be nice to simplify _arguments syntax a little. I'd still be
inclined to deprecate the initial space form but I'm really not so
fussed.

Though it is fairly rare for label loops to run more than once.
