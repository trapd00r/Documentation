The following paragraph looks strange:

 Every spec may also contain a list of option names and argument
 numbers with which the option or argument described is mutually
 exclusive. Such a list is given in parentheses at the
 beginning, as in `(-two -three 1)-one:...' or `(-foo):...'. In
 the first example, the options `-two' and `-three' and the
 first argument will not be offered as possible completions if
 the option `-one' is on the line before the cursor. Also, the
 list may contain a single star as one of its elements to
 specify that the description for the rest arguments should not
 be used and it may contain a colon to specify that the
 descriptions for all normal (non-option-) arguments should not
 be used.

The second example `(-foo):...' is not mentioned anywhere and looks a
bit strange anyway.
