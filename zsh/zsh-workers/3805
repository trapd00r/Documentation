I've been waiting and waiting for someone to point out that
${i:s/foo/bar/} does work (and has worked for years and years), you
just need the final / (though I'm working on that, too), but no-one
has.  I can't believe no-one else knew?

Looking at the documentation, I can see the confusion:  it's mentioned
in the history section that modifiers also work on parameters, but not
in the parameter section.
