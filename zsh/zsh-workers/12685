We check for NIS by testing return value of ypcat. I am not sure it is correct
way to do it (actually, I am pretty sure, it is the wrong way). ypcat may fail
if system currently is not configured for NIS; or no server temporary is
available. It has nothing to do with having needed functions and headers that
we actually intend to check for.
