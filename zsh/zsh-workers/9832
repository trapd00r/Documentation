Hello,

  I can't configure the latest development version of zsh on my Tru64
machine:

creating cache ./config.cache
configuring for zsh 3.1.6-dev-19
checking host system type... Invalid configuration `alphaev6-dec-osf4.0f':
machine `alphaev6-dec' not recognized

...

checking for yp_all... yes
./configure: test: argument expected

  It seems that it comes from config.sub. I've replaced it with
xemacs-21.1.9's and it 

  Thanks!
