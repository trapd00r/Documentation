} 
} No. Seems like the (e) flag makes the thing be quoted as in double
} quotes. I.e. with a='${~^arr}*', ${(e)a} gives `[sS] Src/M ../*', but
} a='${(@)~^arr}' gives what we would have expected. The patch below
} changes the calls to parsestr() to calls to parse_subst_string() to
} get that. Hm, should we call that only conditionally, e.g. if the
} ${(e)...} is not inquotes and has no (@) or something?

My first reaction would be to answer "yes," and a little fooling around
with 9757 applied seems to bear it out:

 a='*'
 print -l "${(e)a}"

Would you really expect to get one file name per line in that case?
