Hi,

Under Mac OS X, the _mailbox_cache freezes at the line

  _pine_cache=(${~pinedirectory}/**/*(.))

which does ~/mail/**/*(.), but as the filesystem is case-insensitive,
this searches for files in ~/Mail, and this is really slow (I have
huge maildir mailboxes there).

Moreover I don't use pine. So, I don't see why I would waste time to
set _pine_cache during a Mutt completion.
