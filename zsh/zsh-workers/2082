Absolutely.  There's no need for this to be built in to zsh, and it
wouldn't pull its weight if it were.  Few people would use it (I can't
stand coloured ls output) -- it'd be quite a lot of useless code.

Much better would be a generalisation of completion listing so that one
could have a shell function statting each file via [[ -S $foo ]] etc.,
and outputting the colour codes itself.  It would mean a few more
syscalls (possibly), but (a) it's infinitely configurable, (b) it
doesn't require much more code, (c) overhead is almost zero for people
not using it.
