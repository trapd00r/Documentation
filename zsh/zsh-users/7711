copy-search-as-buffer() { zle end-of-history; BUFFER="$LASTSEARCH" }
zle -N copy-search-as-buffer
bindkey '\ee' copy-search-as-buffer

Choose your own binding in place of escape-e, I just picked something that 
isn't bound by default.  The "end-of-history" isn't strictly necessary, 
but it means you aren't left with a modified buffer in the middle of the 
history after the first part of the incremental scan.
