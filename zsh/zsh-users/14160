No, because the port $SSH_CONNECTION[(w)2] is, in general, not
the same. And if you don't consider the port, you can have a
false positive as soon as there is an active ssh connection
between the two machines.

There are two cases:

1. If a screen session is resumed or if a -S option is provided, then
   $STY can be guessed by parsing the options, and possibly by using
   the output of "screen -ls", e.g. in case of "screen -r".

2. If a screen session doesn't exist yet and a -S option isn't
   provided, then do not create a file: create it from the screen
   session. However if the form "screen cmd" is used while no shell
   rc file is run, the file cannot be created; in such a case, the
   -S option would be required to make it work (if these environment
   variables will be needed).

This assumes no race condition, but a race condition is very unlikely.

The man page says:

  -R   attempts to resume the youngest (in terms of creation time)
       detached screen session it finds.

As the creation time is provided by "screen -ls", it is possible
to find the session name.

See above.

Yes, perhaps a bug? (The behavior isn't documented.)
