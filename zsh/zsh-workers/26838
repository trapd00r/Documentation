Thanks, but I managed to get the old version working.

What it took, for reasons I'm not able to understand, was to force 
HAVE_MALLOC_H to 1 (rather than 0 as configure wanted to set it to); 
this stopped it from trying to redefine the malloc functions, and after 
that it built (and handled the zsh docs) just fine. (Although it kept 
complaining it couldn't find malloc.h ...)  I have no idea what 
happened, but now I can test patchs I make to the zsh docs, so that's 
better... ;-)

Thanks for the help, everyone,

Jesse Weinstein
