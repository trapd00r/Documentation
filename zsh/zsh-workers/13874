I'll commit _vared later

As you mentioned, _apm got left behind. I've never seen the apm
command. Is it Mandrake specific? It should probably be in
Linux/Command or somewhere.

A few things aren't quite right. I did configure with
--enable-function-subdirs. I got some old directories (User, Bsd,
Builtins) - we should be able to remove them. compinit, compdump etc
got placed in their very own subdirectory and $fpath is wrong. Should I
not have used --enable-function-subdirs?
