Perhaps (not sure if smart-insert-last-word was supposed to do that).

Also, I've seen another bug in smart-insert-last-word: When I recall
a previous history line, e.g. with up-line-or-history or with
history-incremental-search-backward, then kill the last word and use
insert-last-word, instead of getting the last word of the lastest
history line, I get the last word of the history line that was
entered just before the recalled history line.
