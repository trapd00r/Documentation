<H1 ID="S1"><SPAN CLASS="chapnum">1</SPAN><BR>A Look at the Terminal</H1>
<P>This chapter introduces you to the VT420 video display terminal. The
VT420 is a general-purpose terminal that you use to communicate with a
host computer system. The chapter provides an overview of the terminal
and its basic operating features. The chapter also tells you where to look
in this guide for more information about each feature.</P>
<H2 ID="S1.1">VT420 Components</H2>
<P>The VT420 has two main components, a monitor/terminal unit and a
keyboard (Figure 1-1). The monitor/terminal unit is simply called the
terminal in the rest of this guide.</P>

</TABLE>
<H3 ID="S1.1.1">Terminal</H3>
<P>The VT420 uses a 359 mm (14 inch) monochrome screen. The VT420
screen can display 24, 25, 36, or 48 lines of text in 80 or 132 columns.</P>
<P>There are three connectors on the rear of the terminal, for connecting
the VT420 to one or two host computer systems. You can also use one
of the connectors to connect to a printer. Chapters <A HREF="chapter2.html">2</A> and <A HREF="chapter3.html">3</A> describe the
terminal's connectors.</P>
<P>The terminal's tilt and swivel base lets you adjust the screen to the
viewing angle you prefer.</P>
<H3 ID="S1.1.2">Keyboard</H3>
<P>The VT420 uses Digital's LK401 keyboard. The keyboard has four groups
of keys and two indicator lights. The main keypad looks similar to a
typewriter keypad. A cable connects the keyboard to the right side of the
terminal.</P>
<P><A HREF="chapter4.html">Chapter 4</A> describes the LK410 keyboard.</P>
<H2 ID="S1.2">Your Computer System</H2>
<P>You can use the VT420 with one or more computer systems. You have
several options for connecting your terminal to a computer. You can
connect the VT420 directly to a computer, or indirectly through a <DFN><A HREF="glossary.html#TERMINAL">terminal
server</A></DFN> or <DFN><A HREF="glossary.html#MODEM">modem</A></DFN>. The system you connect to is called the <DFN><A HREF="glossary.html#HOST">host</A></DFN>.</P>
<P>Normally, the keys you type on your keyboard send information to the
host. The host stores the information and displays it on the terminal's
screen. You can print the data by sending it to a printer connected to the
terminal.</P>
<P>You can use the VT420 with the <DFN><A HREF="glossary.html#APPLICATION">application software</A></DFN> on your host. For
example, your host may have applications that let you do word processing,
data entry, or programming.</P>
<H2 ID="S1.3">Features</H2>
<P>With a VT420, you can</P>
<UL>
<LI>Select operating features from the keyboard.</LI>
<LI>Use two computer <DFN><A HREF="glossary.html#SESSION">sessions</A></DFN> on one terminal.</LI>
<LI>Display information from two sessions at the same time. You can
select two <DFN><A HREF="glossary.html#WINDOW">windows</A></DFN> from the keyboard.</LI>
<LI>Copy information from one session to another session.</LI>
<LI>Display 24, 25, 36, or 48 lines of text in 80 or 132 columns.</LI>
<LI>Store data locally in <DFN><A HREF="glossary.html#PAGEMEMORY">page memory</A></DFN> for display.</LI>
<LI>Store frequently used commands and text in macros.</LI>
<LI>Fill the screen with a dark or light background for viewing comfort.</LI>
<LI>Align the screen.</LI>
<LI>Check the terminal's operating status.</LI>
</UL>
<H3 ID="S1.3.1">Set-Up</H3>
<P>Set-up is a series of display screens that let you examine and change
the terminal's operating features from the keyboard. Each screen lists a
particular set of operating features for the terminal. For example, one
set-up screen lists communication features, while another lists keyboard
features.</P>
<P>Some features are for your convenience, and some are required by your
host computer system. Each set-up feature has a <DFN><A HREF="glossary.html#FACTORY">factory-default</A></DFN> setting.
You can select the settings that are right for your system.</P>
<P><A HREF="chapter5.html">Chapter 5</A> describes set-up in detail.</P>
<H3 ID="S1.3.2">Two Sessions</H3>
<P>When you use the terminal to communicate with a computer system, you
have established a session on that system. The VT420 lets you establish
two sessions and display data from both sessions at the same time. You
can connect the terminal to two different systems, depending on your
installation (<A HREF="chapter2.html">Chapter 2</A>).</P>
<P>Here are some important tools you use to select and run two sessions:</P>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Terminal comm ports</STRONG> set-up feature</LI>
<LI>SSU Enable command</LI>
<LI>Windows</LI>
<LI><SPAN CLASS="keyname">F4</SPAN> (Session) key</LI>
</UL>
<P>The procedure for selecting and running two sessions is simple. Here are
the basic steps:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Set the <STRONG>terminal comm ports</STRONG> feature to match your cable
connections to the host system.</LI>
<LI>Use the <SPAN CLASS="keyname">F4</SPAN> key or the SSU Enable command to initiate two sessions.</LI>
<LI>Press the <SPAN CLASS="keyname">Ctrl</SPAN> <SPAN CLASS="keyname">F4</SPAN> keys to select two windows.</LI>
<LI>Use <SPAN CLASS="keyname">F4</SPAN> to easily switch back and forth between two sessions.</LI>
</OL>
<P><A HREF="chapter3.html">Chapter 3</A> provides the detailed procedures for setting up your terminal to
run two sessions. <A HREF="chapter7.html">Chapter 7</A> describes how to use two sessions.</P>
<H3 ID="S1.3.3">Windows</H3>
<P>You can divide your screen into two windows. With windows, you can see
information from two sessions at the same time. There are two styles of
windows, full screen and split screen. The default is a full-screen window.</P>
<P>To change the windows style, you simply press the <SPAN CLASS="keyname">Ctrl</SPAN> <SPAN CLASS="keyname">F4</SPAN> key combination.</P>
<P>When you divide the screen into two windows, you can adjust their
relative size by moving the border between them up or down. <A HREF="chapter7.html">Chapter 7</A>
describes how to use windows.</P>
<H3 ID="S1.3.4">Number of Lines on the Screen</H3>
<P>The VT420 lets you select a font size to display 24, 36, or 48 lines on the
screen. You use the <STRONG>lines/screen</STRONG> feature to select the number of display
lines. <A HREF="chapter7.html">Chapter 7</A> describes how to select the number of lines/screen.</P>
<H3 ID="S1.3.5">Page Memory</H3>
<P>The VT420 has off-screen memory to store data entered from the keyboard
or host system. The VT420 can store 144 lines of text.</P>
<P>The terminal's memory is called <DFN><A HREF="glossary.html#PAGEMEMORY">page memory</A></DFN>, because you can divide the
144 lines into a different number of pages. By default, the terminal uses
6 pages of 24 lines each. If you run two sessions, the default format for
each session is 3 pages of 24 lines.</P>
<P>Pages create boundaries that affect the way the VT420 displays text.
To take advantage of page memory, your applications must be able to
recognize these page boundaries.</P>
<P>See the <STRONG>page arrangement</STRONG> feature in the "<A HREF="chapter5.html#S5.7">Display Set-Up Screen</A>"
section of <A HREF="chapter5.html">Chapter 5</A>.</P>
<H3 ID="S1.3.6">Copy and Paste</H3>
<P>The VT420 has a copy and paste feature that lets you copy information
displayed on the screen and send it to the host system. You can send the
copied text to the same session or to another session. <A HREF="chapter7.html">Chapter 7</A> describes
how to copy and paste text.</P>
<H3 ID="S1.3.7">Status Line</H3>
<P>The VT420 displays a status line at the bottom of the screen. If you are
running two sessions, the terminal displays a separate status line at the
bottom of each session. The status line has several fields that provide
information about the terminal's operating status. For example, one field
shows you the current position of the cursor as a set of screen coordinates
(row and column number). Applications may also use the status line to
send you messages.</P>
<P><A HREF="chapter4.html">Chapter 4</A> describes the status line.</P>
<H3 ID="S1.3.8">Keyboard Indicator Line</H3>
<P>The VT420 also displays a keyboard indicator line at the bottom of the
screen, below the status line. This indicator line has several fields that
provide information about the keyboard's operating status. For example,
the first field indicates which session you can edit from the keyboard.
Other fields indicate if screen data is on hold, if the <TT>Caps Lock</TT> or <TT>Shift
Lock</TT> setting is in effect, if a compose sequence is in progress, or if you
must wait before entering more keyboard data.</P>
<P><A HREF="chapter4.html">Chapter 4</A> describes the keyboard indicator line.</P>
<H3 ID="S1.3.9">Screen Alignment</H3>
<P>The <STRONG>screen align</STRONG> feature on the Set-Up Directory screen lets you adjust
the position of the text on your screen for your viewing comfort. If the
text is not centered on the screen, you can center it.</P>
<P><A HREF="chapter5.html">Chapter 5</A> describes the screen alignment feature.</P>
<H3 ID="S1.3.10">Screen Background</H3>
<P>The VT420 lets you select a screen background to improve the readability
of text on the screen. The <STRONG>light/dark screen</STRONG> feature in the Display
Set-Up screen (<A HREF="chapter5.html">Chapter 5</A>) uses an overscan method to fill the screen
background.</P>
<H3 ID="S1.3.11">Emulating VT Series Text Terminals</H3>
<P>The VT420 can operate like other VT series text terminals. This
feature enables software to recognize the terminal and select the correct
emulation automatically. The VT420 can emulate the following text
terminals:</P>
<UL>
<LI>VT300 series</LI>
<LI>VT200 series</LI>
<LI>VT100 series</LI>
<LI>VT52</LI>
</UL>
<P>To have the VT420 emulate another terminal, you use two features in the
General Set-Up screen.</P>
<UL>
<LI>The <STRONG>terminal mode</STRONG> feature chooses an emulation mode to match
the software application. The VT420 is compatible with the VT220
and VT320 text terminals, so you should use the VT400 mode setting
to emulate these terminals. Other text terminals have their own
selections.</LI>
<LI>The <STRONG>terminal ID</STRONG> feature has settings to match the terminal that uses
the software application. This feature makes the VT420 identify itself
to the host as the terminal you wish to emulate.</LI>
</UL>
<P><A HREF="chapter5.html">Chapter 5</A> describes the General Set-Up screen.</P>
<H3 ID="S1.3.12">Character Sets</H3>
<P>The VT420 uses coded character sets to exchange information with a host
system. A coded character set is a group of graphic symbols, such as
letters and numbers, represented by unique bit combinations or codes.</P>
<P>From the General Set-Up screen, you can choose different character sets
to match your computer system or to meet your software application
requirements. The VT420 has two 8-bit multinational sets, the DEC
Multinational character set and the ISO Latin Alphabet No. 1 character
set. The VT420 also has the DEC Technical character set for certain
applications.</P>
<H4 ID="S1.3.12.1" CLASS="notoc">8-Bit Multinational Character Sets</H4>
<H5>DEC Multinational Character Set</H5>
<P>The VT420 is initially set to use the DEC Multinational character
set. This 8-bit character set contains the standard characters for the
English language, plus many characters used by major Western European
languages.</P>
<H5>ISO Latin Alphabet No. 1 Character Set</H5>
<P>You can also select the ISO Latin Alphabet No. 1 (ISO Latin-1) character
set of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). The ISO
Latin-1 set is similar to the DEC Multinational set, but it is newer and
has more characters.</P>
<P>Digital recommends using the ISO Latin-1 set for most applications.
However, if you use the DEC Multinational set, many applications will be
unaffected by the differences between the two character sets. Refer to the
<CITE>VT420 Programmer Reference Manual</CITE> for detailed information about the
two character sets.</P>
<P><STRONG>National Replacement Character Sets</STRONG></P>
<P>The VT420 also supports twelve 7-bit national replacement character sets
(NRCs) for older 7-bit applications. The NRCs are similar to the 7-bit
ASCII set, but they replace some symbols with characters for European
languages.</P>
<H4 ID="S1.3.12.2" CLASS="notoc">Selecting the Character Set</H4>
<P>You can select 8-bit multinational character sets or 7-bit NRCs. If you
use the multinational sets, you can select the DEC Multinational or ISO
Latin-1 set from the General Set-Up screen. If you use NRCs, you can
select the character set from the Keyboard Set-Up screen.</P>
<P><A HREF="chapter5.html">Chapter 5</A> describes the General Set-Up and Keyboard Set-Up screens.
<A HREF="chapter9.html">Chapter 9</A> shows the character sets.</P>
<H2 ID="S1.4">Programming the Terminal</H2>
<P>The <CITE>VT420 Programmer Reference Manual</CITE> explains the control functions
used to access the terminal's features. Programmers use these functions
in their applications. The programmer reference manual is intended for
users with programming experience.</P>
<P><A HREF="chapter9.html">Chapter 9</A> of this user guide is a summary of the control functions
and commands described in the programmer reference manual. See
<A HREF="appendixb.html">Appendix B</A> for information on how to order the <CITE>VT420 Programmer
Reference Manual</CITE>.</P>
