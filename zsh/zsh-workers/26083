The error is coming from here:

I note this comment in comp_match():

	     * Almost certainly this fails in some complicated cases
	     * but it should catch the basic ones.

I wonder if comp_match() should set noerrs before parse_subst_string()?
Or perhaps there's a more comprehensive (and less hackish) fix.
