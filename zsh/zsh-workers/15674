I just noticed that this means that

	zsh% man l<TAB>

won't complete what you expect, because it tries to complete manual pages
in section `l' that begin with `l'.  (This is not new with my patch.)

This means we should do something different when CURRENT==2, but I'm not
sure exactly what.  The easiest change is probably to replace

+  else
+    sect=$words[2]

with

+  elif ((CURRENT > 2))
+    sect=$words[2]

but perhaps we should actually offer to complete section numbers?
