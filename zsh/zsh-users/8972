} Are you using the new completion system (with compinit)?  The best way
} of tracking this down would be to see what the completion scripts are
} doing.

It's almost certainly the zsh/parameter module looking up all possible
user names on the system to implement the $userdirs variable, which is
used by several of the completion functions including _expand and the
more obvious _users and _tilde_files.

Unfortunately there's no simple way to disable this.
