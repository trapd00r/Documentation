Subject: Completion after zle doesn't work
Date: Wed, 27 Feb 2002 17:13:59 +0000
Message-ID: <2301.1014830039@csr.com>
From: Peter Stephenson <pws@csr.com>

% zsh -f
% autoload -U compinit
% compinit -d
% zle ^D

hangs until I type ^C.  Unfortunately ^X? does something even more
disastrous (seems to mess up the tty), but I did get a 1/2 MB output
before the shell completely stopped responding.  I won't send it unless
somebody asks for it, but one thing that's worrying is

+_all_labels:27> _comp_tags= widgets  widgets  widgets  widgets  widgets ...

etc.
