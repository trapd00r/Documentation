[...]

By the way, what about having the empty string (or any sequence
of white space) resolve to 0 in numeric context everywhere?

We already have:

$ echo $(())
0
$ (()) || echo null
null
$ [ 0 -eq "" ] && echo yes
yes
$ a=; echo $(( a == 0 ))
1

AT&T ksh and pdksh have:

$ a=1 pdksh -c 'echo ${a[]}'
1

zsh could have the same and also *(om[,2]) would be another way
to get the 2 most recent files, what do you think?
