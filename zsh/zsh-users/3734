yup, $_mailbox_cache was set to /var/mail/slipcon, which does exist, but 
isn't used because mail gets filtered straight to my MH folders.

I unset _mailbox_cache, and ran it again.  completion still doesn't work, and 
_mailbox_cache gets set back to /var/mail/slipcon.  The dump file is
over 400k, so I'm not going to send it to the list.  I've put it 
at http://mercea.net/~slipcon/misc/zsh25027mutt2

Thanks,
Scott
