Thanks for explaining this Peter.  As a naive end-user I forget the
complexities of the inter-relationships of the parts.  Ideally (IMO),
'setopt nocaseglob' should work for both globbing and completion.

If by 'former' you meant that NO_CASE_GLOB works if no explicit
matcher is specified (which looks like what you implemented below),
then I agree.

I applied the patch and verified that my naive test case now works.

Thank you,
