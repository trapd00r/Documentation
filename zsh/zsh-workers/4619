That's not what I would have expected; I would have expected it to either
(a) behave the same as ${foo} [which means what, when foo is an associative
array?] or (b) print nothing, because there's no variable to which the value
of foo can possibly refer.  Printing its own *name* like that isn't sensible
to me.
