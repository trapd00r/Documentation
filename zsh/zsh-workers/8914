I noted some difference between doc and actual output. Doc states:

The completion system represents such a context as a hierarchical name
with components separated by colons. For example the name
:complete:dvips:-o-1 is used when completing the first argument of the
-o option of the dvips command.

where actual output of _complete_help gives:

bor@itsrm2:~%> dvips -o ^Xh
tags in context `:complete::dvips::-o-1':
    arguments
    globbed-files directories all-files

Are these double colons significant? This is really misleading. Note that for
the command position:

bor@itsrm2:~%>
tags in context `:complete:-command-':
    commands executables jobs builtins functions aliases reserved-words
    jobs

these double colons do not appear.
