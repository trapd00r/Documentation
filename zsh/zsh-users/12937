So you don't have a /usrbin/getent command and compaudit has created a
function to emulate it, but that function can't find the "grep" command.
Is your $PATH set up correctly before calling compinit?

} I think it's to do with compinit and it's something dumb.

} There are insecure directories:

} /usr/local
} /usr/share/zsh

} What have I forgot?

I was going to say I thought the problem was related to no "grep", but
you didn't get that error again when running compaudit standalone.  So
probably those directories are world-writable.  (You need to check all
of them, not just /usr/local/bin.)  Is this on Cygwin?
