Thanks for the reply.

I may have my terminology wrong... I'm looking for the created date,  
the date the file was first made, regardless of when it was last  
opened or modified.

'stat' seems to change when the file is touch(1)ed

I can still see the created date in Finder, so I assume it has to be  
stored SOMEWHERE.
