Note: it's fcntl, not flock (flock does not lock over NFS).

If I do not set the option (which is equivalent to not using the patch),
then I get immediate history corruption when using two machines (well,
at least 64-bit ones), 100% reproducible.

I'll try it.

Yes, perhaps. But this would give the user less control on the lock
mechanisms.
