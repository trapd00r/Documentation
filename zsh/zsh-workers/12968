} Here's an improved patch. It gets the string displayed for the
} all-matches special match right (as described in 12936) and it has
} another style, `avoid-completer' (any suggestions for a better
} name?). That gives a list of completer-names for which no all-matches
} string should be added. It has what I think is a sensible default
} value.

What about completers like _list and _menu?  What about _ignored?

I agree that there's some confusion among the term "matches" for the
set of results genereated by completion, "match" in the sense of how the
members of that set are selected from a larger set of possibilities,
"_match" as a completer, and "matcher" as in the matcher-list style.
They're all related, but all subtly different.

I can't decide whether it would be better to try to devise separate
terms for each, or whether that would just be even more confusing (in
the way that "expansion" vs. "substitution" is already confusing in
the context of parameters, aliases, etc.).
