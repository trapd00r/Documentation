DESCRIPTION
Though it is not difficult to write a custom movement (basically a :map
that executes some kind of search or jump) and a custom text-object (an
:omap that selects a range of text), this is too complex for a novice user
and often repetitive. 
This plugin covers the common use case where the movement and boundaries of a
text object can be specified via start and end patterns, and offers a single
function to set up related mappings. With it, you can enhance some built-in
Vim mappings to take an optional [count], and quickly define new mappings for
help file sections, diff hunks, embedded macros, and so on... 

As a generalization of the start and end patterns, the movement and boundaries
of a text object can also be specified via jump functions, i.e. Funcrefs of
functions that position the cursor on the appropriate location and return that
location. This can be used where the jump is difficult to express with a
single regular expression, the jump may need adapting depending on the
context, or other uses. 
This plugin contains some support for movement and text objects consisting of
text regions that can be defined by continuous lines that match a particular
pattern, e.g. comment blocks that all start with /^\s*#/. 

SEE ALSO
The following ftplugins use this plugin: 

diff_movement	  (vimscript #3180): Movement over diff hunks with ]] etc.
fortunes_movement (vimscript #3181): Movement over email fortunes with ]] etc.

mail_movement     (vimscript #3182): Movement over email quotes with ]] etc.

RELATED WORKS
- motpat.vim (vimscript #3030) offers similar functions to setup motion
  mappings, but no text objects (yet). 
- textobj-user (vimscript #2100) has support for user-defined text objects via
  regular expressions. 

USAGE
The plugin defines several functions, which set up the appropriate mappings
based on the arguments that you supply. The following is an overview; you'll
find the details directly in the implementation files in the
.vim/autoload/CountJump/ directory. 

CountJump#Motion#MakeBracketMotion( mapArgs, keyAfterBracket, inverseKeyAfterBracket, patternToBegin, patternToEnd, isEndPatternToEnd, ... )

This function sets up mappings starting with [ and ] for movement (with
optional [count]) relative to the current cursor position, targeting either a
text pattern at the beginning ([{keyAfterBracket} mapping) or a text pattern
at the end (]{inverseKeyAfterBracket} mapping) of whatever you want to treat
as a text block. 

CountJump#Motion#MakeBracketMotionWithJumpFunctions( mapArgs, keyAfterBracket, inverseKeyAfterBracket, JumpToBeginForward, JumpToBeginBackward, JumpToEndForward, JumpToEndBackward, isEndJumpToEnd, ... )

This function sets up mappings starting with [ and ] for movement (with
optional [count]) relative to the current cursor position, but rely on four
passed jump functions instead of text patterns to do the movement. 


CountJump#TextObject#MakeWithCountSearch( mapArgs, textObjectKey, types, selectionMode, patternToBegin, patternToEnd )

Defines a complete set of mappings for inner and/or outer text objects that
support an optional [count] and are driven by search patterns for the
beginning and end of a block. Outer text objects include the matched pattern
text, inner ones not. Selection can be characterwise, linewise or blockwise. 


CountJump#TextObject#MakeWithJumpFunctions( mapArgs, textObjectKey, types, selectionMode, JumpToBegin, JumpToEnd )

This is a generalization of CountJump#TextObject#MakeWithCountSearch() that
invokes custom functions instead of searching for a fixed pattern. This is
useful if the check for a match is too complex for a single regular
expression, or if you need to adjust the match position depending on the
circumstances. 


Often, a region can be defined as a block of continuous lines that all match a
certain pattern. The following functions aid in implementing movements to the
boundaries of these regions and text objects consisting of the region: 

CountJump#Region#JumpToRegionEnd( count, pattern, isMatch, step, isToEndOfLine )

Starting from the current line, search for the position where the count'th
region ends. Use this function to build Funcrefs for forward / backward jumps
that can then be passed to CountJump#TextObject#MakeWithJumpFunctions(). 

CountJump#Region#JumpToNextRegion( count, pattern, isMatch, step, isAcrossRegion, isToEndOfLine )

Starting from the current line, search for the position where the count'th
region begins/ends. 

CountJump#Region#Motion#MakeBracketMotion( mapArgs, keyAfterBracket, inverseKeyAfterBracket, pattern, isMatch, ... )

This function sets up mappings starting with [ and ] for movement (with
optional [count]) relative to the current cursor position, targeting a text
region defined by contiguous lines that (don't) match a:pattern. 

CountJump#Region#TextObject#Make( mapArgs, textObjectKey, types, selectionMode, pattern, isMatch )

Defines a complete set of mappings for inner and/or outer text objects that
support an optional [count] and select regions of lines which are defined by
contiguous lines that (don't) match a:pattern. 
The inner text object comprises all lines of the region itself, while the
outer text object also includes all adjacent lines above and below which do
not themselves belong to a region. 

EXAMPLE
Let's illustrate the usage by developing custom motions and text objects for
Pascal begin..end blocks. 

We want to move around blocks, and override the default section movements for
it: 
]]			Go to [count] next start of a block. 
][			Go to [count] next end of a block. 
[[			Go to [count] previous start of a block. 
[]			Go to [count] previous end of a block. 

    call CountJump#Motion#MakeBracketMotion('<buffer>', '', '', '\c^begin\n\zs', '\c^.*\nend', 0)
The begin pattern positions the cursor on the beginning of the line following
the "begin" keyword, the end pattern on the beginning of the line
preceding the "end" keyword. 


We want to select a block, either including or excluding the lines with the
begin..end keywords: 
ib			"inner block" text object, select [count] contents of
			a block. 
ab			"a block" text object, select [count] blocks. 

    call CountJump#TextObject#MakeWithCountSearch('<buffer>', 'b', 'ai', 'V', '\c^begin\n', '\c^end.*$')

If there is a filetype detection for Pascal files, we can simply put the
above calls in a ~/.vim/ftplugin/pascal_movement.vim script and are done.
