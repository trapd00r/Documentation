I'm not sure what this means.

Do you mean you want all users to share the SAME history file in
/home/user1/, so they can all see what each of the others did during
previous login sessions?

Or do you mean you want each user to have his own file, but to keep all
those history files in /home/user1/?

Or do you mean you want each user to have a file in his own home directory,
but you want to copy the contents of everybody's history files into one
big file in /home/user1/?

Why would you want to do any of those things?  I can think of some things
you might do in /etc/zlogout, but none of them feel very safe to me, and
in any case you can't prevent a user from doing "kill -9 $$" to blow his
shell away without giving it a chance to write anything anywhere.
