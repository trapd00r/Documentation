Subject: capitalizing file names
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1; format=flowed
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Content-Disposition: inline

I need to rename a series of files on Mac OS X, to reflect case
difference.  I have multi-word file names such as

alexy_070411_1971.dng

-- which must become

Alexy_070411_1971.DNG

-- that is, I need to capitalize the filename and the extension.  Lest
of writing a perl/ruby script, is there a zsh way?

Cheers,
Alexy
