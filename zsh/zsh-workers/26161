I'm not sure where you're finding this.  I have "-1" only in section
"16.4 Single Letter Options" under "16.4.1 Default set":

-1
     PRINT_EXIT_VALUE

In 16.2.11 I have:

INTERACTIVE (-i, ksh: -i)
     This is an interactive shell.  This option is set upon
     initialisation if the standard input is a tty and commands ...

And in 4.1 I have:

-i
     Force shell to be interactive.
