[ I'm cc workers now, i'm not subscribe to workers so plz cc me ]

If what you are saying is correct, why I'm seeing this: 

[0:16|elektron ~]
% 
At 12:39 AAA has logged off from node-c
At 5:41 AAA has logged on from node-c
At 12:37 BBBBB has logged on from 50-208.bbned
[12:39|elektron ~]
%

The log-on times are remembered, the log-off time are always the current time.
Is there a problem on my system with the wmtp file, or something?

grtz
