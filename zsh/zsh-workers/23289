That doesn't explain everything though.

In 

zsh -c 'ulimit -t 0; (while :; do :; done)'

we get the SIGXCPU, but that's because of zsh's optimisation not
to fork() for the () that is the last statement of the inline
script.

zsh -c 'ulimit -t 0; (while :; do :; done); :'

lasts more than 1 second.

$ sh -c 'ulimit -t 0; sh -c "ulimit -t"; :'
0

So it would seem that the limit is inherited but not applied in
the child (and I couldn't see any signal being blocked or
ignored). So that's probably not a libc issue, rather a Linux
issue.
