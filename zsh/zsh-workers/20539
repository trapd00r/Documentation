This prevents the warnings, though I don't know if there's a deeper
problem occurring here.

To: Debian Bug Tracking System <submit@bugs.debian.org>
Subject: Bug#279417: zsh: "make" completion issues "bad option" warnings for some Makefiles

Package: zsh
Version: 4.2.1-9
Severity: normal


For some Makefiles, trying to complete make targets pollutes the screen
with error messages from within the completion code. For example:

	[barton](2) % make expandVars:36: bad option: -I
	expandVars:36: bad option: -W
	expandVars:36: bad option: -h
		make
	completions of type: file
	Makefile    x

The attached Makefile snippet reproduces the above behavior.

Jason
