If you need to debug your configuration it is pretty save to just send
the name of the current file to stdout, e.g. by adding a echo to the
beginning of each file. You can even do this conditionally, for
example by adding

export CONFIGDEBUG=3Dtrue

to /etc/zshenv if you're root on this machine, or to ~/.zshenv.

And then you add something like

[[ -n $CONFIGDEBUG ]] && echo "Reading: <filename>"

to each file. This way, you see what's happening and it's still easy
to disable the output.

I'm using this method to debug my startup files sometimes, because I
wrote several functions to make it easier to work with several Solaris
commands and products.
