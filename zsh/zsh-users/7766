Apparently no one has discovered Functions/Misc/zargs.

# This function works like GNU xargs, except that instead of reading lines
# of arguments from the standard input, it takes them from the command
# line.  This is possible/useful because, especially with recursive glob
# operators, zsh often can construct a command line for a shell function
# that is longer than can be accepted by an external command.
