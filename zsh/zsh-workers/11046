I'm seeing a similar problem with the latest code.  I have a directory with
only three files named build.out{,1,2} and sometimes I see incorrect behavior
with completion.

If I try completing "bui", I sometimes get only "build" or more often I get the
following sequence from hitting tab:
   bui --> build.out[] --> build[.]out --> build.out[] --> build.out1[]
         --> build.out2[]
The cursor jumps back from the end to the dot, and then back to the end with
normal behavior.
