Does that mean you're not planning to include these patches in 3.0?
Or does this:

mean that you ARE planning to include them?

Actually, the only options that make this difficult are those that (1)
affect non-interactive behavior and (2) are not tied to an emulation.
As long as the "emulate" command sets/unsets all the appropriately-
tagged options, you can always do:

	zshfoo() {
	    setopt localoptions
	    emulate zsh
	    # Now do stuff using default zsh settings
	}

Note, though, that for this to work "emulate" should never turn OFF
localoptions -- I note that it turns it ON for ksh, so right now it
probably also turns it off sometimes.

Ooooh.  I think I'd rather it stayed out for 3.0.
