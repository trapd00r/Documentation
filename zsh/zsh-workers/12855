} I continue to ask myself just how useful it is.

I suspect it's intended to be used in the :completion:expand-word:expand::
context, though I didn't realize the context never gets any more specific
than that.  That way the user can decide whether to invoke it.

If it would work to set compstate[insert]=all inside _expand_word, before
calling _main_complete, then we could do that instead and remove the
handling for that style from _expand.  I don't have time today to try
this.
