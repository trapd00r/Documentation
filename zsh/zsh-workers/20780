Just got this... looks like the iconv changes for Cygwin caused other
problems.

Subject: zsh 4.2.4 build failure
Date: Thu, 3 Feb 2005 08:00:43 -0800
To: Peter Stephenson <pws@csr.com>

Dear Peter:

I built 4.2.3 on a new OS X machine yesterday without any problems.  
Today after seeing your email I tried to build 4.2.4 using an identical 
procedure (configure command just obtained from the history stack) and 
it fails like this:

gcc -Wl,-x   -o zsh main.o  `cat stamp-modobjs`   -L/sw/lib -lpcre -ldl 
-ltinfo -lm  -lc
ld: Undefined symbols:
_libiconv
_libiconv_close
_libiconv_open
make[1]: *** [zsh] Error 1
make: *** [all] Error 1

It also does this on my laptop that has compiled everything since 
4.1.1. without incident.

I can live without the bleeding edge, but thought I should provide the 
feedback...

All the best, and thanks so much for writing the book too.

Bill
