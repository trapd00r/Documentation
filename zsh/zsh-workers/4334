Subject: Bug?  multicomp no longer works for paths starting with tilde (~)

The multicomp function seems to assume that
   newtop=${~origtop}
will expand to the user's home directory, but that doesn't happen.  Later,
   reply=(${~reply})
also doesn't expand the home directory, and hence finds no matches.

This seems to apply to both 3.0.5 and 3.1.4.  Am I just misunderstanding
what's supposed to be happening?  I reverted back to the baseline 3.1.4
version of multicomp, and it still won't complete anything starting with
a tilde.

The following seems to work better, but messes up if there are wildcards
following the tilde.  Suggestions?
