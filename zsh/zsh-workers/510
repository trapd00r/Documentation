This uses a couple of zsh features, and is fairly convoluted, which may
or may not be a good thing.

Incidentally, I noticed that if one has a word e.g "echo"
on the command line, and attempts to insert [[]<magic-space> before it,
then the shell hangs, at least with unpatched hzoli 10.3.  Which may
have been fixed, but I mention it just in case.
