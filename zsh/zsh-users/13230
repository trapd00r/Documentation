Hm, good point. I think I'll rename the variables to vcs_info_msg_N_.

Yes, that's quite right.
There is a big difference in what the different backends can do. The
most complete one is the one for git - since that's the system I know
best by far.

The svn backend was done in a pretty basic environment (as you can
probably tell). And that is correct for many of the other backends as
well.

Improvements are explicitly encouraged. :-)

Well, how deep are your typical repositories? Do they go a lot
further then, say, five levels?

I guess you are right.

That would be unfortunate. I wouldn't mind, if there would be another
more machine-friendly way to extract the information... But that would
have to be done by a subversion-dev.

I'll take a look at that one tomorrow.

Thanks for your thoughts. :)
