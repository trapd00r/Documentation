I'm not sure that it would be best implemented as a module - an
increasing amount of zsh seems to be written in shell code and you
wouldn't want to have to recompile the binary just to account for those
patches. It would be just as convenient if you used a simple text file
in the source area to list the patches.

I think it would be rather awkward if the patch-maker had to include a
suitable hunk. Also, the patch-maker wouldn't know the message number so
the patch numbers couldn't correspond to message numbers.

How do you extract patches from e-mails - I'd be inclined to write a
filter which takes the message header to grab the message number and
puts it in a file. It can then also cut out the patch. It'd work quite
conveniently if you used z-mail or mush and their scripting.

If PWS is going to be away for a while then it might help a lot if
someone else releases an intermediate release. I rarely apply c-code
patches because it's not normally a long wait to the next pws release
but I had wanted to apply a couple of Sven's recent patches. I had
little success with this so I'll either have to get all the patches from
the archive or wait.
