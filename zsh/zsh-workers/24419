In prompts, wouldn't it be sufficient for a zero-width character to
behave as if it had been written with %{ %} around it?  (Of course
that could still get all sorts of messy with PROMPT_SUBST if the
value of a variable contains a zero-width character.)

In the line editor I'm not so sure.  Treating it like a non-printable
character seems like a good first step.
