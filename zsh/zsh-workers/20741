I would think so...

I haven't seen what's involved (it seems to compile so I don't know
what the problem is).

We keep the individual sets of digits in a logical order, so 4.2.3-dev-1
is after 4.2.3.  This makes automated version testing work (is_at_least,
for example).  Test versions break this but they're supposed to be short
lived (using 4.2.3-test-A would work and I think I've done something like
that in the past).

The other fix is to sacrifice a version number that will never be released.
