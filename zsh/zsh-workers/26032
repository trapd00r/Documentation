Presumably this is connect to parsing subscripts?  unset 'a[b]' is not an
error if a is an associative array (even if the element b doesn't exist),
though 'a[b' obviously is.

I think this one is probably clearest.  ("Parameter" isn't a very good word
for a variable, but that's too widespread to do anything about.)

I would think having the error as soon as possible is good.

Hmmm... "-" *is* an identifier if $- is a parameter.  Maybe the test
needs fixing.  However, the parameter is readonly, and readonly specials
can't be made writeable, so a simple local fix would be to test if the
parameter existed despite the failure of the identifier test and report an
error if it was readonly.  Same with "?".
