Until I convince other admins at our site to put zsh in /etc/shells,
I'm running it out of my home directory.

I tried putting

[ -f ${HOME}/loc/bin/zsh ] && exec ${HOME}/loc/bin/zsh -l

in my .login (and made .login executable).

However, upon logging in, I simply get the ksh prompt, as if the
conditional statement evaluated to false.  When running this on the
command line, it works just fine.

I know the system ksh was reading my old .login file before I
moved it out of the way and put in the (simple) new one.

Any ideas?
