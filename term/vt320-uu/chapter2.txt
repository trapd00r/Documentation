                            2 A Look at the Terminal

   The VT320 is a general-purpose video display terminal that lets you
   interact with software applications on a host computer system. This
   chapter provides a brief overview of the VT320 terminal and how it
   operates.

VT320 Components

   The VT320 terminal has two main components, a monitor/terminal unit and
   keyboard (Figure 2-1). The monitor/terminal unit is simply called the
   terminal in the rest of this manual.

  Terminal

   The VT320 uses a 356 mm (14 in) monochrome screen that can display 24
   lines of text, in 80 or 132 columns. Line 25 is reserved for the
   terminal's status line. You can connect the terminal to a host
   computer, terminal server, or modem. You can also connect a printer
   directly to the terminal.

  Keyboard

   The keyboard has four groups of keys and four indicator lights,
   described in Chapter 3. The main keypad is similar to a typewriter
   keyboard. The keyboard cable connects to the right side of the
   terminal.

   There are 15 models of the VT320 keyboard available, for different
   languages. Appendix D shows the 15 keyboards.

How the VT320 Works

   You use the keyboard to interact with an application on your system.
   You send data to the application by typing on the keyboard. Data sent
   by the application appears as text on the screen. You can print text
   from the VT320, if you have a printer connected to the terminal.

   Applications use programming functions to perform many operations. The
   VT320 can work with standard American National Standards Institute
   (ANSI) functions.

  Set-Up

   The VT320 has a series of set-up screens that list the operating
   features of the terminal. You can display these screens and change
   feature settings from the keyboard.

   For example, the VT320 has an On-Line/Local feature. You can only set
   this feature from set-up. When you use the "On-Line" setting, the VT320
   can communicate with your host system.

   To enter set-up, you press the Set-Up key. Chapter 4 describes set-up.

  Emulating VT Series Terminals

   The VT320 can also operate as a VT200 series, VT100 series, or VT52
   terminal. You select the operating mode from the General Set-Up screen
   (Chapter 4). There are four possible settings.
     * VT300 mode, 7-bit controls
     * VT300 mode, 8-bit controls
     * VT100 mode
     * VT52 mode

   The factory default setting is VT300 mode, 7-bit controls. This mode is
   fully compatible with VT200 series terminals. Use this mode for VT200
   applications. Factory-default settings are the initial settings the
   terminal uses when shipped from the factory. These settings are
   permanently stored in the terminal's memory. You can use set-up to
   reset the VT320 to the factory-default settings at any time.

Character Sets

   The VT320 has two types of built-in character sets, for use with
   different types of computer systems.
     * 8-bit multinational sets
     * 7-bit national replacement character sets

   You can select from 2 multinational sets or 12 national replacement
   character sets (NRCs). You use the Character Set Mode feature in the
   General Set-Up screen (Chapter 4) to select the type of character set:
   "8-Bit Characters" for multinational sets, or "7-Bit Characters" for
   NRC sets.

  Multinational Character Sets

   When you first use your VT320, the terminal uses the DEC Multinational
   character set. This set contains the characters for the English
   language, plus most characters used in the Western European languages.
   Use this set with applications that require strict compatibility with
   VT200 series terminals.

   You can also select the ISO Latin-1 character set of the International
   Standards Organization. ISO Latin-1 is the new industry-standard set.
   It is similar to the DEC Multinational character set, with a few
   different symbols and characters.

   Both multinational sets include the standard ASCII character set of the
   American Standard Code for Information Interchange.

  National Replacement Character Sets

   NRC sets are for 7-bit computing environments. Each NRC set is for a
   particular Western European language or dialect. NRC sets are similar
   to the ASCII set, but replace a few ASCII characters with characters
   used in that language or dialect.

   You can only use one NRC set at a time. You select the NRC set by
   setting the Keyboard feature in the Set-Up Directory (Chapter 4).

   If you set the Character Set Mode feature in the General Set-Up screen
   to "7-Bit Characters", you cannot use the 8-bit multinational character
   sets. However, if you set Character Set Mode to "8-Bit Characters" you
   can still use an NRC set. In that case, the NRC set replaces the ASCII
   set.

  Summary

   Figure 2-2 summarizes how to select a character set by using set-up
   features. Appendix E shows each character set.

CRT Saver Feature

   The VT320 has a CRT saver feature to extend the life of the terminal's
   screen. The screen automatically goes blank if the terminal is inactive
   for 30 minutes (no keyboard activity or input from the host system).
   You do not lose the data that was displayed. To reactivate the screen,
   press any key.

   When the CRT saver feature is on, a blinking block cursor appears at
   the lower-right corner of the screen. The cursor indicates that the
   terminal is still on and the CRT saver feature is activated.
