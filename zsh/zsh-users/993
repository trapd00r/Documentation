Just to be able to log in as root while my computer in booted
single user, as only / is mounted and root's shell is zsh.

Why?  When you're logged as root, you also use ed instead of vi
to keep it simple? :-)

As I manage a lot of machines remotely, I like to have a good
shell for root (who still uses sh without beeing bothered?) and I
don't want to have many uid 0 accounts.  So root's shell is zsh
and it needs to be static so I can log in where I'm in front of
the computer and it's booted single user.
