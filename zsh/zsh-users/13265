} Apologies, you're right; it seems you *do* need the @ flag, but my test
} was too simple to show it.
} 
} array=("${(f@)mapfile[foo.txt]}")
} 
} I'm not entirely sure why that is but I must be misremembering the (f)
} rules.

This is a fairly recent change (well, about a year ago):

     For historical reasons, the usual behaviour that empty array
     elements are retained inside double quotes is disabled for arrays
     generated by splitting; hence the following:

          line="one::three"
          print -l "${(s.:.)line}"

     produces two lines of output for one and three and elides the
     empty field.  To override this behaviour, supply the "(@)" flag as
     well, i.e.  "${(@s.:.)line}".
