It's a bug in _subversion, I think.

Try adding

   local ret=1

somewhere near the top of the function _svn_subcommand in the file
Completion/Unix/Command/_subversion and see if that fixes it.  Or better
yet, delete

       && ret=0

   return ret

from the end of that function, leaving just the _arguments call.  The
same goes for _svnadmin_subcommand, for that matter.
