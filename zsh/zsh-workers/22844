    I use both CVS and Subversion, and have no problems doing the things
    you mention (except the single file checkout[1]), assuming that you
    mean "working copy" where you say "sandbox", and that by "checking
    out a single subdirectory on a different branch" you mean "updating
    a single subdirectory to a different branch".

    [1] Subversion doesn't allow this. I have never needed this feature,
    although I can see it can make all the difference if you store
    extremely large files in the repository, or the directory structure
    is under-developed. Luckily, Subversion allows you to copy and move
    versioned items freely and without the lossage that's inevitable
    when you move files in a CVS repository.
