Yes I use that with my zsh prompt, I have code to use battery to pull  
the percentage and then stick it on the right-hand-prompt. Also have  
it change colors from green to yellow to red depending on the  
percentage, and show whether or not I am plugged in (AC) or using  
battery (DC). For example (hopefully Mail.app doesn't wrap it  
horribly...

--INSERT-- :zsh-4.2.5: (Sun 10/14/2007 15:13 EDT)
<Mike@artemis:~>
:p2: %                                                             
*AC* (99.8%)

The --INSERT-- is from visual vi mode...

I'm hoping that with leopard things don't change so much that it  
breaks my prompt :)
