I hate to waste bandwidth, but I have had a recent procmail disaster,
and all of my filters/folders are gone, as well as archived mail.  Thus,
I need the listserv address for this list.  I am going nomail for a
month, and I cannot find the listserv address for zsh-users.

Respond in private.  

Thanks,
Stu
