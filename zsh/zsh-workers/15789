I have some more info on this one - I finally found
what appears to be a culprit.  The .profile has a
definition - HISTFILE=~/.sh_history; export HISTFILE

This seems to have been what was causing me all the
headaches...   Is this a bug in ZSH?  Is this something
that ZSH should handle??

Thanks

Monty

It's possible that you're running into a per-process limit, most likely
the maximum allowed size of the environment (e.g. the sum of the lengths
of all the environment variable names plus values).  Make sure you're
NOT doing `setopt all_export' or some such; if your login shell is not
zsh, try something like `printenv | wc' (I've forgotten whether solaris
has printenv) to find out how big the environment is.
