I tend to agree with this.  If a command *requires* at least one option
before anything else can be completed, though, it might be nice to have
more indication of that than just a beep.

} screen space - I don't think they add to the readability at all.

However, I do like seeing the long options along with the short ones
after only a single '-' has been typed.  I may not remember which short
option goes with which long one, or that there is a long one that has
no corresponding short, or whatever.  Because of this, I prefer to see
the leading '-' or '--' in the listing (particularly as long as there
remain some commands that have "long options" but still use one '-' to
introduce them).
