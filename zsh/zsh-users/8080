That probably means that nvi has modified the $PATH and left out things
like /bin.  So, I assume it is trying to execute "zsh" and that is
failing (due to the PATH).  There might be a way to configure the PATH
to fix this.

I assume you could also avoid the problem by changing your screen setup
to use this:

shell -/bin/zsh

That continues to tell screen to use a login shell, but also ensures
that $SHELL contains a fully qualified program name.
