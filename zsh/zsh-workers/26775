Hi every body,

A simple mail to present you the project that asyd (the guy behind zshwiki) and
myself have begun. It is called ZEN for Zsh Extended network, it can be seen as
a cpan for zsh.

zen first of all a un zsh function that can install, upgrade et manage other
functions with dependency checking et versioning management.

it is a reprository of small functions with a kind of namespace management
written in pure zsh (not call for external binaries except for particular needs
ie xclip)

Everything is modular a lot a reusable functions.

zen can also be seen as a sandbox for zsh developpers.

in zen there can be every kind of functions (including completion), widgets
(zle), etc.

zen is open to everyone to participate (one of the goal is to simply be able to
share maximum of code and to resuse it)

for ZSH developpers feel free to help yourself in the zen repository (for what
is in now, and new scripts in the future) everything is and will be in ZSH
license.

so everyone feel free to use, review, discuss, improve, paritipate to the
project.

Hope the mail is clear enough, if not have a look to:
- Home Page: http://www.zshwiki.org/home/zen
- Project management: http://dev.keltia.net/projects/zen

regards 
Bapt
