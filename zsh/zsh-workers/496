Thanks for the comments, Zoltan.

Yes, I agree. Richard should take a bow here ;-).

Yep. zle wins over readline in my book.

Does zsh support associative arrays?

Uh-oh. If I use the (f) qualifier I only get the first line -- without
it, I get all the group names in a single line separated by
whitespace. A bug in my (old) hzoli version -- 2.6-beta11-test7-hzoli11 --
perhaps? 

Thanks again everyone for the comments. 

Unless I receive some objections, I plan to collect information from
this thread and create a summary article to put on the web site. With
proper credits/acknowledgements, of course.
