} I can believe there's some logic missing here, but it's not currently
} clear to me here what.  Could you post an explicit recipe for
} getting from an unconfigured shell to an expansion that doesn't
} (somehow) display all the elements?

This is a problem with old compctl, not compsys.

With compinit run and LANG=3DC and/or "unset LANG" I get:

schaefer<504> cat *<TAB>
schaefer<504> cat a
Completing expansions
a         b$'\300'  c=20=20=20=20=20=20=20
Completing all expansions
a b$'\300' c
Completing original
*

With LANG=3Den_US I get:

schaefer<506> cat *<TAB>
schaefer<506> cat a
Completing expansions
a   b=C0  c=20
Completing all expansions
a b=C0 c
Completing original
*

With "compsys" turned off (old compctl completion) I get the something
sensible when LANG=3Den_US:

torch% cat *<TAB>
torch% cat a b=C0 c

But the bug appears with LANG unset:

torch% cat*<TAB>
torch% cat a b

So the recipe PWS wants is just to run "zsh -f".
