I would add that

while (( i++ < 10 ))
{
        echo i is $i
}

is also wrong, since newline behaves line a semicolon.  And I would not
encourage the usage of this brace syntax in scrips because these syntax
rules are quite complicated.  The old sh syntax do not have these hidden
traps.  A lengthy discussion of this syntax in the FAQ may seem to
encourage the usage.
