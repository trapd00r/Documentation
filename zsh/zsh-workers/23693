Yes, that's exactly what's happening.  The file names are quoted in the
script _path_files, then compadd -Q is called to process them without
adding more quoting.  This means the matching is done on the quoted form.

The easiest thing to do is to unquote strings for matching when -Q is
passed.  There may be complicated cases where this isn't the right thing to
do, but it should catch cases like this.
