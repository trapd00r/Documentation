When I added the following line to my ~/.zshrc

HISTFILE=~/.zsh_history

the shell froze/hang when I started a new terminal. Adding set -x to 
~/.zshrc produced the following output in new terminals:


+/Network/Servers/SERVER/Users/name/.zshrc:5> HISTSIZE=1000
+/Network/Servers/SERVER/Users/name/.zshrc:6> SAVEHIST=1000
+/Network/Servers/SERVER/Users/name/.zshrc:8> 
HISTFILE=/Network/Servers/SERVER/Users/name/.zsh_history


Googling didn't turn up anyting. I also asked in the zsh irc-channel on 
freenode but no one there had seen this before so they suggested that I 
post my question here.


Any ideas?
