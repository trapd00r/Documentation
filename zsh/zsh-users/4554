it looks like the package requires ncurses shared libraries, so you
might either look for a statically compiled package, or you might
install a package which provides the ncurses libraries.  you might check
the sunfreeware site for this.

sun has a vendor supplied zsh package with solaris 8, but i don't know
if there's one for the version of solaris you're running. it didn't look
like there was a zsh package on the sunfreeware site for 2.6 either.
