:	is there currently some way to reproduce the effect of
:the tee command in the shell itself, and if not, what do people
:think of the idea of adding that ability (either by new file
:redirectors or by making tee a builtin)?  a couple of times
:recently, i've been caused many problems by the fact that tee
:is a standalone program, and as such doesn't care about the
:value of options like clobber; since tee _is_ basically just
:another form of file redirection, it would be nice to have it's
:behaviour be consistent with the other forms provided by the
:shell.

You need to have the appropriate setopt.  See MULTIOS in the manual.
