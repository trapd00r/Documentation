Subject: Anyone noitce problem with SHLVL in 4.2.1 ?
X-Mailer: VM 7.18 under Emacs 21.3.1
X-Spam-Checker-Version: SpamAssassin 2.63 on a.mx.sunsite.dk
X-Spam-Level: 
X-Spam-Status: No, hits=0.0 required=6.0 tests=BAYES_50 autolearn=no 
	version=2.63
X-Spam-Hits: 0.0

Just observed that SHLVL is not updated every shell invocation with
4.2.1 (on Solaris 8).  For examaple,

cns-build4 paullew destiny>> echo $SHLVL
2
% zsh -f
% echo $SHLVL
2
% zsh -f
% echo $SHLVL
2
% zsh -f
% echo $SHLVL
2
% exit
% exit
% exit

Bug or feature?  Thanks in advance.
