It works in 4.2 (but not 4.1.X). And the problems with pasting seem to
be only a problem with the 4.1 Cygwin zsh and not my 4.2.0 Linux zsh.

But I think the real culprit is *toggle*. It should turn off
predict-on when predict-on doesn't make sense. But toggle turns off
predict-on as soon as I type my first character (and that *really*
doesn't make sense)

Thanks, Thorsten

autoload -U predict-on; predict-on

zle-line-init() { predict-on }
zle -N zle-line-init

zle -N predict-on
zle -N predict-off

bindkey '^Z'   predict-on
bindkey '^X^Z' predict-off

zstyle ':predict' toggle true
zstyle ':predict' verbose true
