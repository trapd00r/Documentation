Change the WORDCHARS variable, documented in zshparam(1).
 WORDCHARS <S>
   A list of non-alphanumeric characters considered part of a word by
   the line editor.

Default is:
WORDCHARS='*?_-.[]~=/&;!#$%^(){}<>'

Change this in your .zshrc to the equivalent, without the '/' in there.

Perhaps the 'emulate' command should also change WORDCHARS accordingly?
