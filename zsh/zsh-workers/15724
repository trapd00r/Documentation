} I never knew you could do that. Still, ')' as an autoremovable suffix
} would be better behaviour than the current situation.

The question in this case (and in other cases of multiple suffix layers)
is exactly when you remove them.  E.g. with a file suffix like '/', it
gets removed if you immediately press enter, but in the above case it
should not get removed.  Also with $(...) or `...`, pressing space after
the autoremovable suffix is ambiguous -- more arguments to the command,
or the next thing after it? -- whereas with a pathname '/' a space almost
always means that you're done with that file name.
