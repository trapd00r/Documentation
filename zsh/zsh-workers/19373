As my excuse, I shall point out that that the same applies to rusage and
there have been other similar commands such as nice that were here in
the past (before getting their own function). And the name `_precommand'
doesn't necessarily imply the modifier part of 'precommand modifier'.

So if we add a copy of _precommand in Unix/Command what can it be
called? Or is it better to just keep this in one place?
