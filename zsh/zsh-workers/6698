Hi 

Firstly, I'd like to join with Helmut when he says....

I certainly prefer it. So much computer documentation is written in
American that Im used to it but it would be nice to have some in
British english.

yes, Americans spell recognise with a z. Bitwise and otherwise I think
are correct on either side of the Atlantic.
