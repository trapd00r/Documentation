There's no option to get that behavior because, in general, regenerating
the prompt might change too much of the editor state.  For example, what
if you're editing at the secondary prompt (e.g., on the second or later
line of a shell function or quoted string)?

So the closest you could do is "setopt no_notify" so that job termination
is only recognized/reported immediately before printing the prompt.
