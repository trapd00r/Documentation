Thanks for noticing this.  In fact, for CVS Libtool, we just call
AS_SHELL_SANITIZE to get Autoconf's initialization blurb (and its
fixes).  There is an open (unrelated) issue about that code being
discussed over at autoconf-patches at the moment; I'll backport it
to branch-1-5 as soon as that has settled.

Thanks again!

Cheers,
Ralf
