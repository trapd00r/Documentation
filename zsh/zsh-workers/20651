Hey together,

Since FreeBSD-5.3 their bsdtar (default tar) and since GNU tar 1.5 they
both are capable of autodetecting compressed archives, thus applying the
right flag.

Might be we want to adjust zsh to also complete on .tar.gz, .tbz, .tgz
and .tar.bz2 allthough neither z nor j is specified among the flags.
