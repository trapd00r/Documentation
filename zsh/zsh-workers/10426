I made a quote error - your login is opk as requested - sorry!

Well - it was just a quote error.

Oliver> Karsten: if you get a chance, can you check the account setup.

Try:

cvs -d :pserver:opk@sunsite.auc.dk:/pack/anoncvs login
<enter your password>

cvs -d :pserver:opk@sunsite.auc.dk:/pack/anoncvs co zsh

It should work just fine. Do not use yuor email address as login name.

Karsten
