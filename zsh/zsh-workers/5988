Hm, dunno, I don't get this (not even with an unchanged pws-14), and
as far as I can see there weren't any patches for `zsh.yo' for quite
some time.

Well the compctl-manpage is already big enough, I think. Also, for me
at least they are not so closely related as for someone who proposed
`compcall' and what is now `compctl -i'. Finally I think that at least 
the description of the example system should be kept separately -- I
even hesitated to put it into zshall/zsh.texi at all. After all, this
is shell code and thus is completely different from what the rest of
the docs describes.

Bye
 Sven
