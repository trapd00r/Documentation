} I just noticed that in zsh 2.6 beta 12 and 13, this feature has been turned

I believe the reason was because on some systems, scripts that don't
have a controlling terminal (or that are in the background) cause some
kind of an error, or get stopped by SIGTTIN, when initializing termcap.

Am I remembering wrong?
