There are only three open.

  feature request: position cursor to fix errors              Clint
 
This certainly isn't urgent, any time we want to think about it (it's not
necessarily Sven's problem since it's a more general editing issue --- the
errors are in spelling correction, not completion).

  Quoting in associative array indices is bad                 pws

It would be nice to do this properly, but it's not going to happen any time
soon.

  various issues with promptsys                               adamspiers

This looks like future development work.
