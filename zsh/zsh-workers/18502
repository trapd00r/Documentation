Thanks, that does get it made for me, however Y01completion.ztst appears
to hang indefinitely on testing.  ZTST_verbose=2 make test gives me:
    ./Y01completion.ztst: starting.
    ZTST_getsect: read section name: prep
    ZTST_getchunk: read code chunk:
    . $ZTST_srcdir/comptest
    ZTST_execchunk: status 0
    ZTST_getchunk: read code chunk:
    mkdir comp.tmp
    cd comp.tmp
    ZTST_execchunk: status 0
    ZTST_getchunk: read code chunk:
    comptestinit -z $ZTST_testdir/../Src/zsh &&
    {
        mkdir dir1 &&
        mkdir dir2 &&
        touch file1 &&
        touch file2
    }


I assume then that HP-UX is one of the known systems on which dynamic
loading doesn't work, true?  Has there been any discussion on this
in the past that I could refer to, and does anyone recall whether the
the problems look fixable?

Regarding Peter's followup, I had a chance to try gcc 3.0.2 on zsh and
had no trouble -- it gives me identical results to HP's compiler for
everything I've tried.
