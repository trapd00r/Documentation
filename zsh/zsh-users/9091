Hi,

 Something went wrong...

 Before I tried to tidy up my .zshrc, kill-line was on ^k (as it is on
 Emascs.) In my old .zshrc (a backup) I found no extra bindkey-command
 to bind only ^k.

 My old and my new zshrc contain the "bindkey -e" to switch on Emacs
 mode.

 But now "kill-line" is not on any key and ^k calls expand-word.

 Are any bindkeys done by something "completer"-related (I have
 heavily modifiecd this one) ???

 I am wondering, what has kill my kill-line?!!!

 When I compare my old zshrc and my new one I cannot figure out, what
 has done the switch ...

 Ideas ?

 Thanks a lot for any help in advance!
 Meino
