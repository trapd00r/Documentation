echo $ZSH<TAB> just beeps at me in pws-11.  It did the right thing in pws-10 - 
it offered me the menu of ZSH_NAME or ZSH_VERSION.  

: ~ Sun 7 18:20; echo $ZSH<TAB>
                           ^
                           +---- This just beeps.

BTW, both echo and print have the same behavior.  This behavior occurs even
with zsh -f.

Is this an intentional change?  Do I need to set a new option?

Thanks,
  vin shelton
