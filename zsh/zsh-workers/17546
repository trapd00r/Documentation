Looks like one of the system definitions is going haywire, causing the
wrong branch of an #if to be used in term.h.  It's virtually impossible
to debug without examining the files and definitions in detail.

The easiest think to do is simply not compile the termcap module, which
isn't that important.  Edit the line in config.modules in the top of the
build hierarchy:

name=zsh/termcap modfile=Src/Modules/termcap.mdd link=dynamic auto=yes load=yes

to change `link=dynamic auto=yes' to `link=no auto=no'.  If it turns out
to be nccessary, do the same to the corresponding line for the terminfo
module.

I'm seriously considering omitting the termcap and terminfo modules from
the 4.0 line, they've caused no end of grief for fairly minor features.
