    Hm. I have a standalone machine I wanted to have the uguide
    available on. I thought I'd build it on this (connected) box, and
    take it home.

    # cd /usr/ports/textproc/yodl && make install clean
    ... failed, because yodl needs dvips as a dependency, and that
    isn't available (w/o teTeX) anymore.
    # cd /usr/ports/print/teTeX && make install clean
    # !-3

    That is a bit too much involved for my taste, but I can take it.
