Are you really, seriously suggesting that it's worthwhile to expend
50-70 thousand bytes defining the completion for a single command?  
In the case of zip that's 45% larger than the executable; it's even
larger than the executable and its manual page combined.

In find.xml there are about 5500 bytes of actual data, including the
help text ... the other 89% is XML tags.  I'm sorry, I just can't get
excited about this.
