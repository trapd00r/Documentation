The only bash completion for subversion that I've seen is
/etc/bash_completion.d/subversion in the Debian subversion package,
which I assume is that to which you refer.  The zsh function was written
without hardcoding any subcommands or options.

I seem to recall Adam Heath doing some work on emulating zsh completion
functions in bash.  Perhaps he could encapsulate the zsh functions
somehow.
