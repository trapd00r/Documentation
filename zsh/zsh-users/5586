You could also put a "echo " in front of it and a "> sometempfile" at
the end, run the other command you want to execute and then "source
sometempfile". And there are probably even more painful ways to do it...

When I press ^C to cancel a command, i do it to really cancel and never
ever see it again. Why would i want it to add to the history? It gets
long enough without several dozens of wrong commands.

Just use the buffer stack that zle provides like anybody else.
