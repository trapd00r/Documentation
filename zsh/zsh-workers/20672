It is possible to get straight to the last item from the first by using
the reverse-menu-complete editor command. I bind that to shift-tab:

  bindkey '\e[Z' reverse-menu-complete

For the behaviour you want, with the up and down keys, you can try the
following bindings:

  bindkey -M menuselect '\e[B' menu-complete
  bindkey -M menuselect '\e[A' reverse-menu-complete

Note that your terminal may generate different escape sequences from
those keys.
