I also keep my dot files in sync.   Since my computers are accessible on
the Net.  I use subversion.  I place my dot files in a sub-directory
and symbolically link to my home directory.

% ls -aF ~/.dotfiles

.bashrc    .zshrc .zshenv  .svn/

% ls -l ~/.bashrc

lrwxrwxrwx   ...     ~/.bashrc  -> .dotfiles/.bashrc

The .dotfiles directory is managed by subversion.  Any changes made on
any computer can checked-in.   To update any computer just requires a
"svn update" in the ~/.dotfiles directory.   If you have control of your
server "on the Internet" then you can run subversion via http or https.

You may also consider the distributive version control system that the
linux kernel uses namely "git".   You can have multiple repositories and
pass around "patch" or "diff"s around.  The diff's can be emailed.
