} I think I've applied all the completion patches to  ZSH 3.1.6-pws-5.

} When I do a "setopt listpacked listrowsfirst" and attempt completion
} with tab I don't get a listing for ambiguous matches.

I can reproduce this, but ONLY if using the new-style completions, and
then (so far) only for normal file completions (e.g. completion after
"ls").  It's got something to do with lines 8880-8919 of zle_tricky.c,
and how the value of `i' is computed (Sven, I know it's going to be two
weeks until you read this, but: I thought you were going to start using
more descriptive variable names?).

I tried a few different tweaks, but although I got it to display the list
I couldn't get it to position the cursor properly afterwards.

I can't figure out how to get zsh to enter the branch at 8826-8856, so
I don't know whether that has a problem as well.

Even for completions that do work, the columns are ragged:

zagzig<4> set<TAB>
set     setclock     setconsole   setenv       setfdprm        setfont  
setfx   setkeycodes   setleds     setmetamode   setopt          setserial 
setsid   setsysfont   setterm     setup        setup_compinit   setxkbmap 

I don't know of that's an intended side-effect of LISTPACKED or not, but
it doesn't always happen.
