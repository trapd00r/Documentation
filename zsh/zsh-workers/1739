I suppose that's right, since the manual says that nullglob overrides
nonomatch, and (elsewhere) that cshnullglob overrides nullglob, but it
does seem a bit of a palaver deciding on the behaviour, easy to get
confused, and hard to set the behaviour you want if there are default
settings in /etc/zshrc.  Still, there doesn't seem to be much to do
without a really radical options overhaul (setopt
nomatch=csh/null/none would be nice).
