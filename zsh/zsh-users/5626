I have a issue with zsh installed on HP-UX 11.0 and wanted to see if =
anyone else had the same problem.
After compiling a copy of zsh_4.0.4 and installing it I noticed the =
backspace and delete keys on the keyboard are no longer functioning. =
When the keys are used I get a one forward space then nothing.=20
I installed the same version of zsh on Solaris and the backspace and =
delete key work correctly
Any ides?
