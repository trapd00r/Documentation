Excellent, thanks.  I was hoping someone would get around to that.

These files are all in group users, and writable by that group.  Can I
suggest that you chgrp -R them to group zsh?  I also did a chmod g+s
-R on /home/groups/zsh/zsh so that any new directories created would
end up in group zsh, so you might like to do that too.

$ quota -g
Disk quotas for group users (gid 100): none
Disk quotas for group zsh (gid 5068):

As I said elsewhere, I've submitted a bug report about this.

Likewise, done.

I already put a couple of links on http://zsh.sourceforge.net/, but this could doubtless be improved.

I'm not keen with the way that www.zsh.org is more of a pointer than
the main webpage.  Is there a good reason for this, and could it be
changed?

True, although I don't see any reason why we couldn't place htdocs
under the same repository as the source.

Nor me.
