Then it works!  It turns out that I was using the sort.exe in c:/WINNT/syst=
em32/sort
(did not know there was one). This sort.exe insert the ^Ms
=20
I am now back to using the original compdump file and having

    path=3D(/usr/bin $path)

in my .zshrc

That works too. So will you change it in the zsh distribution (compdump=20
file) too? A speedup would be good because the compinit call is slow.
(I use compinit -C in my .zshrc to speed it up a bit)
