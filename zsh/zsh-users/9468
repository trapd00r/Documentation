Thanks. I tried removing and recompiling the .zwc files anyway, although
root and my user have different .zsh directories, and each can read its own
files with no problem. There are no .zwc files in the /usr/local/share/zsh
directories so that shouldn't be a problem...

For the other poster, I get the same behavior whether I su or log in as roo=
t
- the default shell for root on FreeBSD is csh, so whenever I become root I
just run zsh manually... could that have something to do with it? Running
zsh manually as my user the completions work fine.
