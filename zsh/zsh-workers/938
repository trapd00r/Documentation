I do not remember if this problem was reported, but it was present in all
2.6 beta releases of zsh. If you have a directory you may not read in your
PATH, any command not found in search find will be followed by "Permission
denied" error, instead of "Command not found".

Experience has shown that this is extremely confusing to users, equally
newbies and experienced ones (excluding the ones having experience with this
bug:>). People often have a forbidden directory in their path, which means
they get "Permission denied" every time they misspell a command.
