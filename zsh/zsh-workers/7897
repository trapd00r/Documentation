Hadn't thought about generic support for caching (well, only in the
context of moving (parts of) `_argument' into C-code).

Now I'm dreaming again: if we had a generic package system, even with
dependencies between packages, we could have a `cache' package and
make completion depend upon that...

Sigh.
