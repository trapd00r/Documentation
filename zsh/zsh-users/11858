It's on by default in completion functions.  I would get used to having
it on and quote accordingly.  If you must turn it off, use
"setopt localoptions" or "emulate -L zsh" to prevent the change escaping
from the function.

Now I look, the problem is another quoting problem:

 definedclusters="($(grep ^clusters $HOME/.csshrc | cut -d= -f2- 2>/dev/null))"

You're assigning the string starting "(" and ending ")", not an array.
In full, you want

 definedclusters=($(grep '^clusters' $HOME/.csshrc | cut -d= -f2- 2>/dev/null))
