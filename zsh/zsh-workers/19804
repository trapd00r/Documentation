Yes, it's included with the zsh-beta package.  What's keeping it out of
the zsh package is a hack so that the main zsh binary (and other
modules) don't depend on libpcre.  I intend to get to this before
sarge's release.

It's currently possible to do this:

if [[ value -pcre-match pattern ]]; then

Any perlre backreferences in the pattern will go into the $match array.
I thought I had written documentation for it, but perhaps I was
hallucinating.
