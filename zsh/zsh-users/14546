if $TERM is not defined on a system and the zsh/termcap module is loaded, 
the shell dies.

//start code

% zsh -f
yoyo% export TERM=xterm-hundred-billion-colors
zsh: can't find terminal definition for xterm-hundred-billion-colors
yoyo% zmodload zsh/termcap
terminals database is inaccessible

//end code

on freeBSD (7.2 and several older versions; 7.2 above) the shell dies with 
a message "terminals database is inaccessible" and a status 1.

similar results on Linux 2.6.31.1, 2.6.31.4 (not sure what distros) and 
Ubuntu 9.10 (2.6.31-14) with a message "unknown terminal type" and status 
1.

in these form it can be gracefully tested:
 	test $(zmodload zsh/termcap)
 	[ $(zmodload zsh/termcap) ]
  but if tested in a sublist the shell still dies:
 	zmodload zsh/termcap && echo $?
