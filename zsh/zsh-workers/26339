Subject: changing bindings in isearch mode?

It looks like the isearch mode bindings are hardcoded, is that right?

I'd really like to have <return> bound to exit isearch, like it does
in emacs..

Would it make sense to have an isearch keymap and use that?

Is there a key in isearch mode that will just exit isearch at the
current position, and nothing else?

thanks,
Greg
