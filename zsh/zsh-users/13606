Hi,

Sorry for this but it is bugging me an I can't find an answer.

When I type > filename

I want it to do the same as cp /dev/null filename

Instead, it waits for me to type control D ??

I've played with >| and no clobber but I can't switch off this annoyance.

HELP ;-)

Thanks in advance,

Jerry
