Ok.  I'm not going to push this, obviously.  I will point out that we
are supporting 440 people currently.  I didn't think that zsh had that
many developers where something like this would be a big issue.  If
it does have a huge number of developers then maybe sources.redhat.com
isn't a good place for it.

We get very few requests to change ssh keys on any of the projects that
we host, so I guess this has never been an issue.
