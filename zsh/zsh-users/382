} In the brief period between installing Linux and changing the default

} second time will give a list of commands.

I think you want

setopt autolist listambiguous

While we're on the subject of just-noticed features in other shells, I
just noticed that tcsh's `complete' command can take a glob pattern for
the name of the command(s) to which the programmable completion should
apply.  Does anybody think this would be useful enough to add to zsh?
