Perhaps the two good solutions are:

1. make the suspend message match the format of the jobs command

Sending a STOP signal (usually via Control-Z) to a process would print
(for example):

[1]  + suspended  vim

instead of:

zsh: suspended  vim

Bash does this and I think it would be quite useful.


2. add support for an option similar to listjobs in tcsh


Is there any interest in either of these suggestions?
