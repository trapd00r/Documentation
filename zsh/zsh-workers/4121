The original behaviour is correct.  "su" really should not give the shell
this weird argv[0] (some versions don't).  But on the older systems where
it does, it's more likely that the shell being invoked is supposed to
be sh, so treating a name of "su" as "sh" is the best behaviour.

To get round this problem, if you can't fix su, put an "exec zsh -l"
in your .profile.  Optionally change your login shell to /bin/sh.

"bsh" == Bourne shell.
