I think so.

That'd be nice.

List only the names of the functions with PM_UNALIASED set, whereas -U
lists the entire definition (such as it is).

} It's not a bad idea, if it isn't hard to implement. Can you think of
} cases where you would want a zero-based array?

Well, if you have ksh_autoload set, then chances are you're loading some
ksh functions, which means you probably also have ksh_arrays set.  So the
real question is whether there are cases where one would want one-based
arrays; the opposite is just for logical symmetry.
