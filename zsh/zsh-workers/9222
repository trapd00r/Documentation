I do not use systems with printcap myself, but termcap (and terminfo, BTW)
description states, that terminal aliases are separated by | with the last one
being the "long, user friendly, name". I believe, printcap behaves the same way.

So, the last entry should probably be ignored. Better yet, it is the one that
should be presented in verbose mode :-)
