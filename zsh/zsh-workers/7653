Every attempt to write stuff for the new completion system is OKish.

Yes, but we somehow seem to have agreed (or `most of us...') to put
everything for one command or suite of command into one function.

`zle -R' is intended for interactive functions (normal widgets). If
you just want to display a message, use the function `_message'.

You may also want to have a look at `Etc/zsh-development-guide' and
`Etc/Completion-style-guide' (the latter is not at all complete --
I'll be thankful for every comment that helps improve it).

Bye
 Sven
