Hi,

I have discovered an annoying quirk in zsh-3.0.6 (at least it's annoying for
me - an ex-tcsh user).

When I use backward-delete-word it appears to completely ignore the
$WORDCHARS variable. Vis:

ozpc92 >echo $WORDCHARS 
*?_-.[]~=/&;!#$%^(){}<>
ozpc92 >cd /usr/local/etc

typing \M-^H here results in

ozpc92 >cd 

instead of the expected (desired):


ozpc92 >cd /usr/local

Am I missing something?

Please CC any responses to my email address as I'm not subscribed to this
