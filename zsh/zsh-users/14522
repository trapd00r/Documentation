} Perhaps it is not a good idea to use zsh for that kind of purpose.

Shells in general are not required to be threadable.  The data scoping
model for shell variables pretty much precludes it.  Shells are for
managing processes; that a shell script can BE a process is secondary.

You'll have much more success if you either use actual processes (the
zsh/zpty and zsh/zselect modules may help you there), or a language
that supports threads natively, or a lower-level language where you
can directly control memory allocation and sharing.
