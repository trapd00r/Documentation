A while ago, Stephane suggested a terrific script on doing things
right inside find's exec.
I'm using that magic advice and it works, fantastic!  Still it's a bit
of a mystery to me.  Why do we need {} {} twice -- although there's
only one parameter reference to $1?

Also, how would I generalize it for two commands inside the script?
Here's an example.  I want to convert a bunch of .tif files to .jpg's.
 The original tifs reside in certain directory structure which should
be preserved in the target directory.

That is, we have something like

tifs/
  dir1/
    A.tif
    B.tif
  dir2/
    C.tif
  ...

And we need to create

jpgs/
  dir1/
    A.jpg
    B.jpg
  dir2/
    C.jpg
  ...

The command to do a single conversion is

convert -quality 100 dir1/A.tif /jpgs/dir1/A.jpg

-- however, we must ensure

mkdir -p /jpgs/`dirname {}` # or some such

-- before we invoke convert with the target path, to make sure it exists.

How can I stick *two* commands inside the exec in a find?

Cheers,
Alexy
