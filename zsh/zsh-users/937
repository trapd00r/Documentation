     Hello, 
     is it possible to use own functions (like run-help) with the bindkey 
     command?

     I want to update my XTERM title bar every time I'll press then ENTER 
     key. I want to have the command name which is executing in the title 
     bar.

     I know the the function precmd(), but it is executed after the command 
     was executed and before writing th prompt. To update my XTERM titlebar 
     I must have a function which is called before executing the command: 
     with teh precmd() I reset my XTERM titlebar after executing the 
     command.

     Does anyone can help me.

     Heiko
