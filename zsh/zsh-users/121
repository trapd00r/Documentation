Hi, folks!

I'm not on your list, but if my message goes through, please note
that key bindings appears to be screwed up in beta11. All control 
keys (for example, ^E, ^A) no longer work in command line editing 
when in "vi" mode (bindkey -v). When control key is pressed, it 
simply gets echoed to the screen. I don't think that this change
in behavior was intentional (at least I hope so).

If there will be any response to this message please, Cc to 
mikhail@klm.com. Thanks!

P.S. I've compiled beta11 under SunOS 4.3.1 and SCO OSE 5 and result
     is the same, as described above.
