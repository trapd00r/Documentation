Hi workers :)

I discovered a small bug in the version in pkgsrc/zsh. In a directory that
contains filenames with spaces, you cannot use the tabcompletion properly when
issueing a CVS command, for example, with these commands:

% /foo> ls
CVS/          foo
bar           this is a file name with spaces
% /foo> cvs upd th[TAB]

The filename part of the command is only expanded until the "this". I noticed
this behaviour only when using CVS commands, all other commands seem to do
just fine. Thought you might wanted to know :)

Keep up the great work! You guys got the best shell in the world :D

Cheers, Vincent
