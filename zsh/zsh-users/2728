Hi,

I have a question regarding ksh-like globbing. I have a
directory with the files `foo', `bar' and `com' and want to
display every file in it that does not contain an a. In ksh or
bash I'd use

ls !(*a*)

for it. If I do a

setopt KSH_GLOB
ls !(*a*)

in zsh it says

zsh: number expected

What am I doing wrong?

Ciao,
	Stefan
