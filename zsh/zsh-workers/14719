I don't get this.

                      ^^^^^^^
In particular, this is missing from my output.  Could /etc/zshenv have
anything to do with it?  Or there could be a race --- there are a couple of
cases where zsh will send an explicit SIGCONT, in particular a whole set in
jobs.c.  Or it could be a red herring, to do with you interrupting it, and
the real problem is earlier.
