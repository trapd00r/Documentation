Hi,

I have tons of directories in my $PATH, but only a
handful of them are needed in each my machine; other
directories simply do not exist. How could I clean up
the non-existing dirs from my $PATH most efficiently?
Doing a for loop in ~/.zshrc just for that sounds a
bit overkill, but at least I couldn't spot anything
like this on man page.

Thanks.
