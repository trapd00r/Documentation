Try:

    zparseopts -E -a args -A args -- '-c+:'

It's not exactly obvious from the documentation, but you must use "--"
to signal the end of the options of zparseopts and the beginning of the
descriptions of the options it should parse.  (Or list at least one
description that does not begin with a "-" before listing any that do.)
