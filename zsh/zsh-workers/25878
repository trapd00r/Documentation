Yes, this fixes the issue, and that's a good enhancement!

Unfortunately if you have plenty of completion possibility under the
same prefix, you hit again the root issue that is that _multi_part is
pretty slow when fed with large arrays. I didn't had a look to
_multi_part in detail yet but I think it is at least an O(n2) kind of
algorithm. I'll try to have a look to the algorithm and see if maybe
there is something that we can do for it.

Thanks for you patch, I'm running with it now :-)
