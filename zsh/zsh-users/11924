Subject: How do I change the subshell to something other than /bin/sh?

Hello,

I am sorry if this has been answered already. I could not find and answer 
with google.

My problem is this. I am trying to run some scripts that I cannot change 
which assume capabilities found in bash. I know that zsh will execute them 
correctly as well. However, when I just invoke them from the zsh command 
line, they run under /bin/sh and fail. For example, I have a test script 
that looks like this:

logsol10-1 ~ > cat x.sh

echo $0

ps

The output when I run it is this:

logsol10-1 ~ > ./x.sh
./x.sh
   PID TTY         TIME CMD
24296 pts/8       0:00 zsh
  5205 pts/8       0:00 ps
  5204 pts/8       0:00 sh

Note that it execs sh. How can I tell it to use another shell? zsh or bash, 
for example?

Thanks,

Julio
