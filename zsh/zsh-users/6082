This is not the same problem.
If I understand things correctly the second-level-of-quoting fix
was meant to produce correct command lines for scp,
and I have this version installed.

But it seems that with this additional quoting of completion results
should go equivalent dequoting when they are used again as the base
for next completions.
The (Q) addition isn't much more than a guess, but Works For Me.

And another deficiency I've just noticed:
scp 'hostname:<TAB>
(note the opening quote) fails to produce any matches.
But for solving this I definitely don't feel qualified.
