Yes, and they're pretty crucial areas, too.  (For those that aren't on
zsh-workers: associative arrays, new syntax for programmable
completion, new glob qualifiers for sorting expansions.  Probably
other stuff I've forgotten.  All cool stuff which, once it's
stabilised, will be very nice, and exactly the kind of thing that
you'd want to be in a book.)

No.  I suspect most Linux distributions ship with zsh.  It's on the
1-CD RedHat, for example.  But typically the default for new users is
bash, so presumably most people will end up using bash.  Of other
Unices, who can tell?
