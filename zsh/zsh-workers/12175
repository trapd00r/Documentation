I'd think: as the tag, if at all.

Or use only one style and the value gives the names of the modules to
use with some kind of token to distinguish between `load always' and
`use if loaded'. If you really want that, because, if the module is
already loaded, why not use it unconditionally? I mean, it should be
faster than any alternative, otherwise using the module doesn't make
sense anyway. In that case the style could be named `load-module', if
course.
