Hi,

I wanted to call

sja.exe /somepath/params.xml

from a zsh script.

where sja.exe is a dos aware utility

This wouldn't work as sja always complained that it couldn't find param.xml

The same script worked as soon as I change the bang to #!/bin/sh

I guess this is because zsh is somehow interpreting the /somepath/params.xml before passing it on.

How do I tell zsh to just pass it on.

(i've a feeling I've already had a similar problem)
