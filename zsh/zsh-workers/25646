Shouldn't normally happen, but I suppose we'll just have to see.  I've
committed the patch.

That's to say, "(echo foo)" causes a DEBUG trap for the (...) itself, and
then a DEBUG trap for any contents inside the subshell according to the
normal rules for a list of commands, but I think that's exactly what we
want (it's the same as for {...}).

I note that $ZSH_DEBUG_CMD has strange (overlarge) indentation for the
elements of (...)  after the opening parenthesis.  I think that needs
revisiting.  I don't quite understand why the default indentation is 1
instead of 0; obviously that's right for outputting the bodies of
functions, but the code has many other uses.
