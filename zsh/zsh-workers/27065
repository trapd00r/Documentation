[...stuff deleted...]
:'19696' is a reference to a mailing list message right?  How do I look
:that up?  I tried the 'Look up message by official number' at
:http://www.zsh.org/mla/
:but it doesn't get me to a message that seems relevant..

It's incorrectly listed.  It's really 18796 (on zsh-workers).

Geoff
