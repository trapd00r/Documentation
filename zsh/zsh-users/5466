  Well, I wish I could be more specific, but if nobody else knows, maybe
this will set you on your way.  I've seen a problem similar to this,
that was a result of emulation settings (read: $TERM variable).  It's
not that zsh is appending the command vs replacing it, it's that the
terminal isn't properly clearing the line before printing the next
command...see what I mean?  Seems like it's related to your backspace
problem; you can only backspace as many characters as you've typed,
because zsh knows you've only typed that many, it's just that your
terminal is sending the character to the right when you hit backspace
instead of the left.
  Or maybe it's something different entirely.  :)=20

        because it is a merger of state and corporate power.
