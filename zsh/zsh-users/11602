The pattern should be:

 $1/*generic*~*\~

The parentheses around the final tilde were confusing it.

You don't need the backslash near the end as a final ~ is a special
case, but it makes it more obvious.

It doesn't matter in this case, but as it happens the pattern after the
first "~" is matching against the entire string, including the
directory.  In other words, for everything that matches $1/*generic* it
sees if that entire string matches *\~ and if so rejects it.  That would
become important if you wanted to match some earlier component in the
final part of the path.
