} Right, here's a more general solution.  Shout if I've missed something.

Looks reasonable to me.  Should it be made clearer that this does not
apply to the CORRECT_ALL option?

I was just looking at adding something to _setup to copy the value of
CORRECT_IGNORE into the ignored-patterns style, but that suffers from
the same bootstrapping issues as MENUSELECT and ZLS_COLORS.  So maybe
it would just be better to document it somewhere.

Or perhaps it would be good enough simply to set it if it is not set:

if ! zstyle -m ':completion:*:-command-:*' ignored-patterns '*'
then
  zstyle ':completion:*:-command-:*' ignored-patterns '_*'
fi
