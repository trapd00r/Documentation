Hi all.
I have the following completion set in my zsh environment setup file.

   zstyle ':completion:*' users $USERS

I also have a custom function to alter the contents of $USERS .   
After running this function to change the contents of $USERS, I need  
to execute the line above in the command line to make the change take  
effect.  I would like my custom function to do this for me, but I am  
having trouble figuring it out.  I tried adding, 'zstyle  
':completion:*' users $USERS' to the bottom of my custom function,  
but that did not work for me.

I hope someone can help me out.
