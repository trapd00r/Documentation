An alternative is to "setopt auto_pushd", which turns every "cd" command
into a "pushd".  Then, if you didn't want a typed "cd" command to do a
pushdir, do this:

function mycd {
  setopt local_options noautopushd
  builtin cd ${@}
}
alias cd=mycd

(That alias doesn't affect the auto_cd functionality.)
