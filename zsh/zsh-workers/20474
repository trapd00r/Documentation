I can reproduce it with a build from the 4.2.0 release, so it's been a 
while.  Obviously interactive menu completion is not a widely-used mode.

I'm a little confused by this remark:

As far as I can tell from the commit history, 4.0.7 never had interactive
menu completion mode.  It was added 2002/06/26 but 4.0 branched off as of
2001/06/13.

Sven W. seems to have believed interactive mode was still working as of a 
commit on 2002/07/05, and none of the changes to complist.c since then 
appear to make any difference, so either Sven was wrong or the bug is in
some other part of the completion system and merely manifests in complist.
