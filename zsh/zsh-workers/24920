Since ret is a size_t, "ret >= 0" is always true.  I've checked in a fix
for that.

Note that I catch things like this due to having more compiler warnings
enabled (-W):

If we want to commit a change like that, we'd need to ensure that
-Wno-unused-parameter was accepted by the compiler (since it wasn't
in older gcc versions).
