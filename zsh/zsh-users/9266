Not sure this is the error, but: it's quite likely cmp needs to be able
to seek backwards. <(...) is often implemented using a pipe on which you
can't do that.  (Results may vary, so you can't assume it will always
work from the behaviour on one system.)

The =(...) substitution exists for this very reason.

  cmp =(output1...) =(output2...)

I'm not sure this is the error because I would expect a slightly
different error message, but it's worth trying.
