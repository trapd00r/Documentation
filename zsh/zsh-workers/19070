    Hi Bart :)

    Yes, with typeset -U, I just learned it a minute ago O:))

    I didn't write anything so elaborated O:). Thanks for the line :)
But this doesn't do the 'uniqueness', so I still depend on the array
(typesetted with -U) or 'uniq'. No problem about that.

    No problem, because I want to get rid of the array so I could put
this in an alias instead of a function. Just for learning.

    Mine did, too. I'm sure that all filenames are of the form
name.digitdigit.jpg, so I carelessly matched all filenames.

    Oh, yes, I knew that I read it somewhere in this list. But I have
4.0.6 and that doesn't work, of course. Thanks for pointing :)

    Well, this is pretty compact, too :)) Thanks a lot :) I've
learned to use the (e) flag!
