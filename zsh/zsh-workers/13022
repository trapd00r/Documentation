The problem I was having was with putting the terminal temporarily into raw
mode without the full majesty of zle and setting a timeout there (in
bin_read()).  select is working fine in the main terminal code.  I didn't
have the week necessary to resolve all the possible ways of setting
timeouts, so I gave up.  I expect it can be done.
