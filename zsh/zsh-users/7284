No problem; you're welcome.

}     No, it doesn't because I didn't thought of it :( Thanks for
} pointing. Could it be solved using the (q) flag or should I use ${//}
} and substitute every dangerous character for a safe version?

The substituion is necessary for slashes, because you can't even create a
file with slashes in the name.

The (q) flag is _not_ necessary for other metacharacters when creating
the file (the argument to "mv" is already double-quoted); the problem
would be with manipulating the names later.  So doing either nothing or
the substitution is appropriate in that case.
