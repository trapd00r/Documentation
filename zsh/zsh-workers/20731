} the `[' is quoted. The following patch fixes it.
} 
} +     "${(e)word}" != *[^\\][][^*?\(\)\<\>\{\}\|]* ]] &&

Doesn't that need to be

                        (#s)(*[^\\]|)[^*?\(\)\<\>\{\}\|]*

or something similar, so that a word beginning with "[[" can match?
E.g. a word beginning with the pattern [[:alpha:].]
