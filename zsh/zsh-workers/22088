Is there a simple way to find out which meta sequence block which multibyte
characters for people who aren't too familiar with UTF-8 encoding?

It might also be worth mentioning that, depending on your terminal
emulator, you might be able to sidestep the problem entirely.  In xterm at
least, you can control whether the meta key sets the eighth bit or sends an
escape character, depending on the values of the eightBitInput and
metaSendsEscape resources.  Other terminals may have similar setups.  There
may still be a certain set of people who won't get exactly what they want,
but it's probably pretty small.

Anyway, thanks for the explanation!

Danek
