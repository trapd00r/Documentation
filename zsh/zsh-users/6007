I'm sure that's correct, but it's undocumented and to mind confusing.
Further, I suspect few people use vicmd from Emacs at all.  So I thought
the new way would be more useful.

That would be useful anyway.  We could have zle-init-hook (at
initialisation) and zle-start-hook (each time the editor is started).
