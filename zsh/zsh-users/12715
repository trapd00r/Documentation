Hello,

First I must apologize for the slighly off-topic question but I
thought it would be a good place to ask it.

I use zsh for shell, rxvt-unicode for Terminal emulator, urxvt runs
with TERM rxvt-unicode, GNU Screen runs with the term screen-256color,
now I'm not sure what's the issue, but when I login through GDM/KDM
the colors inside screen are all messed up, here's 2 screenshots, the
1st one[1] is when gnome was started via usual startx command and the
second[2] is for gnome session when started from GDM/KDM, the colors
are not messed up just in zsh, in mutt and in every ncurses programs..

The second question is about a problem that has been bugging me for a
while now, and it doesn't just happen inside X, but whenever I am inside
ViM, when I type a letter, erase it and type another letter, I'll get
a weird char, not what I've typed, the next quoted character supposed to
be a, and the one after that is f, and i see? "=C3=A5" "=EF=AC=80" "=E3=81=
=AB" ... I have
no idea why this is happening but it's really annoying to have
undetected error like these while scripting... Any ideas ??

The third problem is zsh related ( really sorry guys for the above 2
questions being off topic ), anyway the problem is when I try to use
zsh outside rxvt-unicode the keys Home, PgUP, PgDn and End does not
work, in gnome-terminal instead of going to the beginning of the line,
I get this instead:
"H[2;A[0;G"
Here's a screenshot of gnome-terminal[3]... I included relevant config
files below, key bindings are defind in .inputrc and .zsh/zle

Thank you :)
