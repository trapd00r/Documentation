} My patch moves the recovering of last_file_list from execpline
} to execshfunc.
} I don't understand why this was in execpline...

It can't go in execshfunc because execshfunc isn't executed when using
a simple builtin or an external command.

I think you have the right idea, it's just that the wrong job entry
was given the file list in the first place.  Or something.
