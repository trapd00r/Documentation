Ah, and another question:
As I am a big color-completion-fan (yes, this is emotional, not only
functional :) ) I would like to have my
`--' completion do act in a colorful way.
But I am not sure how I can do that.
As i understand it It does involve zstyle ':completion:*'
something?

Sorry, if I should know this already, but it just did not appear
in my brain yet :)
What i seem to understand is:
ZLS_COLORS=(hosts)bla does some coloring thing with hosts, but what is the
group for -- commands? 
ARRRGH, I wish I was smarter!
