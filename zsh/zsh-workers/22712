My concern is that "printability" shouldn't have anything to do with it.
Programmatically, the expression

    (( ${#:-X} == 1 && ${#(pl.width..X.)} == width ))

should always be true.

I could see an argument that ${#(%pl.width.X)} could compute the padding
based on printable width, because the presence of % means we're expanding
prompt escapes so presumably we want printable values ... but there is
a reason that %{ %} has to be placed around non-printing sequences in
prompts.
