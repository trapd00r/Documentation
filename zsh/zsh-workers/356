Option?  What option?  The option to build with /usr/ucblib?  What for?

Zsh should be fully functional provided that you don't use /usr/ucblib.
There isn't anything in /usr/ucblib that can't be accomplished without
it; nothing is lost.

Perhaps there's some confusion with that last sentence:

}   The symptom of this is that globbed filenames will be missing the
}   first two letters.

That sentence means, "If you accidentally compiled with /usr/ucblib,
you'll be able to tell, because globbed filenames will be missing the
first two letters.  If you compiled it the right way, the filenames
will have all the letters."

Peter S., perhaps that paragraph should be reworded:

*Note for Solaris 2.2 and 2.3*: The UCB versions of the routines for
  reading directories are not usable (the struct definitions are
  incompatible with the ones assumed by zsh).  The symptom of this
  is that globbed filenames will be missing the first two letters.
  For correct globbing, make sure you compile without any reference
  to /usr/ucblib in (e.g.) your LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
