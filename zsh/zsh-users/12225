Could you compile with debugging symbols ("./configure
--enable-zsh-debug" will do this), ensure core dumps are allowed
("unlimit coredumpsize"---you will need to run a separate "zsh" if this
changes the value, since this doesn't take effect for the current shell)
and when it crashes, run "gdb zsh <corefile>" and send the output of the
"bt" command?  (There may then be some follow-up questions on values of
variables etc.)

If Meta-Backspace is bound to anything other than the builtin widget
backward-kill-word we'll need to know that, too.  (This would have to be
in your own initialization files.)

Thanks.
