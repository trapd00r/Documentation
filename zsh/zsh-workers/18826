Appears that I only get blackholed if I send From clint@zsh.org.
I guess primenet.com.au and sunsite.dk aren't playing nice.

This is very rudimentary and somewhat flawed.  In particular, it doesn't
know how to handle help output with multiple usage possibilities, f.ex.
==
usage: 1. export [-r REV] URL [PATH]
       2. export PATH1 PATH2
==
and it doesn't know how to handle repository contents.

A valid url could be file:///path/to/repository/module/trunk
where /path/to/repository is a real directory that contains

dav/  db/  format  hooks/  locks/  README.txt

and module/trunk would be a "directory" contained in the berkeley db
files.

Thanks to Oliver for fixing one of the problems already.
