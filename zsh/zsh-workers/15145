I think they'd be a very useful addition.  Particularly if you can do:

	typeset -A hash
	hash[key]=value
	nameref 'thing=hash[key]'

Which, of course, would be easily implemented given my scheme of storing
a pointer to the referenced node in the nameref node. :-)

You haven't answered any of my questions from 15059, though ...
