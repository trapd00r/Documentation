So far as I'm aware, you're the first person to try it under HP-UX 11
(unlucky) so I have no idea what should happen.  It looks like you have
HPUXDYNAMIC defined, which means there's no dlopen() etc., but there is
shl_load(), etc., which suggests it isn't that different from HP-UX 10
(and if one of those statements is wrong it would be interesting to know
why).

Ideally, we'd like to know what to change.  A quick look at HP doesn't seem
to throw up the relevant docs, so if anyone can help --- the shl_load,
shl_unload and shl_findsym manual pages might just be enough.
