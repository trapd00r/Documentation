That's strange, I have the same symptoms on several Debian Sarge
installations, but not all situation I test. I have built
zsh_4.2.0.orig.tar.gz without the Debian patches, and the problem is
still there. Here is a backtrace:

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x4011513c in mallopt () from /lib/tls/i686/cmov/libc.so.6
(gdb) where
#0  0x4011513c in mallopt () from /lib/tls/i686/cmov/libc.so.6

#5  0x08087581 in newparamtable ()
Previous frame inner to this frame (corrupt stack?)

I can send (or rather upload on an anonymous FTP) you a core file, the
binary, or even the whole build tree, if you find it necessary.
