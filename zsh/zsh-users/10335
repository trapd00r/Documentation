Well, all *I* know is that the s: : is needed -- at least without the
local IFS solution.  If someone can (and is willing) to convince me
that's a bug (I don't yet understand all the flags involved in these
expansions) I can cook up some nice test case/bug report.

Thank you for the local IFS, that does look/appear to be cleaner.

Thank you.  I'll keep that in mind if I run into the problem (dunno,
if I will, I'm prototyping an app and the keys will be filenames).
