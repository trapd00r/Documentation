Yes, it's too dangerous now we're starting to support multibyte
characters properly until we decide whether the character is a letter or
punctuation or whatever.  Eventually the test for valid identifiers will
be based on some locale-specific examination of multibyte characters,
but that hasn't been done yet.  Locale-specific definitions of
identifiers frighten me a bit, so I think they're best avoided, but
that'll be the best we can do.
