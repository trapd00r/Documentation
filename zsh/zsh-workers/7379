Unfortunately, Single UNIX requires, that quotes be matched. This is from the
description of double-quotes:

==
Within the string of characters from an enclosed ${ to the matching "}", an even
number of unescaped double-quotes or single-quotes, if any, must occur.
==

It means, that preceding example MUST be

echo "${a%\'}"
